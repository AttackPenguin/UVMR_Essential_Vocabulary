anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary , coercive forms of hierarchy
anarchism calls for the abolition of the state , which it holds to be unnecessary , undesirable , and harmful
as a historically left - wing movement , placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum , it is usually described alongside communalism and libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing ( libertarian socialism ) of the socialist movement , and has a strong historical association with anti - capitalism and socialism
humans lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states , realms , or empires
with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies , scepticism toward authority also rose
although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history , modern anarchism emerged from the enlightenment
during the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century , the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers struggles for emancipation
various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period
anarchists have taken part in several revolutions , most notably in the paris commune , the russian civil war and the spanish civil war , whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism
in the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century , the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more
anarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics ; there is significant overlap between the two , which are merely descriptive
revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state , having taken a violent turn in the past , while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like
anarchist thought , criticism , and praxis have played a part in diverse areas of human society
criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent , violent , or utopian
the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia , meaning without a ruler , composed of the prefix an - ( without ) and the word arkhos ( leader or ruler )
the suffix - ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy
various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists , although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists
many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as william godwin ( 1756–1836 ) and wilhelm weitling ( 1808–1871 ) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs
the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist ( libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism some usages of libertarianism refer to individualistic free - market philosophy only , and free - market anarchism in particular is termed libertarian anarchism
while the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism , including both the new left and libertarian marxists , who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party , and extreme cultural liberals , who are primarily concerned with civil liberties
to avoid anarchisms negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism
in his many works on anarchism , such as chomsky on anarchism ( 2005 ) , groupnb scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchisms socialist credentials some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism , while most scholars reject anarcho - capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles
peter marshall states that in general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism
anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp , but it also has outriders in liberalism
it cannot be reduced to socialism , and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine
nicolas walter wrote that anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically
in a sense , anarchists always remain liberals and socialists , and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself
we are liberals but more so , and socialists but more so
brian morris argues that it is conceptually and historically misleading to create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism
while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought , defining anarchism is not an easy task for scholars , as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter , and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently
and etymology ( negation of rulers )
major definitional elements include the will for a non - coercive society , the rejection of the state apparatus , the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non - coercive society , and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy
before the establishment of towns and cities , an established authority did not exist
it was after the creation of institutions of authority that anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction
alongside stoicism , taoism has been said to have had significant anticipations of anarchism
anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece
aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy
socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience
cynics dismissed human law ( nomos ) and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature ( physis )
stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state
in medieval europe , there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements
these , and other muslim movements , later gave birth to religious anarchism
in the sasanian empire , mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy , only to be soon executed by emperor kavad i
in basra , religious sects preached against the state
renewed interest in antiquity during the renaissance and in private judgment during the reformation restored elements of anti - authoritarian secularism , particularly in france
during the french revolution , partisan groups such as the enragés and the the first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england , morally delegitimising the state , max stirners thinking paved the way to individualism and pierre - joseph proudhons theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france
this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war and is considered the golden age of anarchism
drawing from mutualism , mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmens association , a class worker union later known as the first international that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents
the international became a significant political force , with karl marx being a leading figure and a member of its general council
bakunins faction ( the jura federation ) and proudhons followers ( the mutualists ) opposed state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings
anarchists were treated similarly in the second international , being ultimately expelled in 1896
anarcho - communists , who drew inspiration from the 1871 paris commune , advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to ones needs
at the turn of the century , anarchism had spread all over the world
in china , small groups of students imported the humanistic pro - science version of anarcho - communism
in latin america , argentina was a stronghold for anarcho - syndicalism , where it became the most prominent left - wing ideology
the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts
illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period
despite concerns , anarchists enthusiastically participated in the russian revolution in opposition to the white movement ; however , they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government was stabilised
several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine ,
in the spanish civil war of 1936 , anarchists and syndicalists ( cnt and fai ) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists
a long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war
in response to the army rebellion , an anarchist - inspired movement of peasants and workers , supported by armed militias , took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain , where they collectivised the land
at the end of world war ii , the anarchist movement was severely weakened
during this time , anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the anti - nuclear , environmental , and peace movements , the counterculture of the 1960s , and the new left
anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols
black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchisms move from a eurocentric demographic
around the turn of the 21st century , anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti - capitalist , anti - war and anti - globalisation movements
anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria , more commonly known as rojava , a de facto autonomous region in northern syria
anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions , social anarchism and individualist anarchism , owing to their different origins , values and evolution
in a chronological sense , anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post - classical currents ( anarcha - feminism , green anarchism , and post - anarchism ) developed thereafter
beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy , without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it
philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy
anarchisms emphasis on anti - capitalism , egalitarianism , and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho - capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism
anarchism is usually placed on the far - left of the political spectrum
such as collectivism , communism , individualism , mutualism , and syndicalism , among other libertarian socialist economic theories
many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely
belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists
inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism
they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism ( collectivist , communist and syndicalist )
they differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society
mutualism is an 18th - century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierre - joseph proudhon
its aims include reciprocity , free association , voluntary contract , federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people
in what is property ( 1840 ) , proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society , the synthesis of communism and property
commonly associated with mikhail bakunin
and that workers be paid according to time worked , rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism
collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society
anarcho - communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production , anarcho - communism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin , anarcho - syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change , replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self - managed by workers
the basic principles of anarcho - syndicalism are direct action , workers solidarity and workers self - management
individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants
as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation
anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left
interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti - globalisation movement , as the movement shaped 21st century radicalism , wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest
the anti - capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents
contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchisms historical association with chaos and violence
its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement , although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory
while theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles , there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms , rather than a singular anarchism , in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently
gender equality can be a common principle , although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha - feminists than anarcho - communists
anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms , namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government ( for example , monarchy , representative democracy , state socialism , etcetera ) , economic class systems ( for example , capitalism , bolshevism , feudalism , slavery , etcetera ) , autocratic religions ( for example , fundamentalist islam , roman catholicism , etcetera ) , patriarchy , heterosexism , white supremacy , and imperialism
the principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions
this entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state , resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy
anarchists tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals , namely to first oppose the establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society , illustrating the unity of means and ends
evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence , reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims , although there is significant overlap between the two
anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century
anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches
during the classical era , anarchists had a militant tendency
not only did they confront state armed forces , as in spain and ukraine , but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed
assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state , some of which were successful
anarchists also took part in revolutions
many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s , the early 1880s and the 1890s , with some still occurring in the early 1900s
anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial
other anarchist groups advocate direct action , a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or terrorism
this attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible
anarchists took an active role in strike actions , although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism , seeing it as reformist
they saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism
in the current era , italian anarchist alfredo bonanno , a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism , has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards
both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small , informal affiliation groups , where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state , capitalism , and other enemies
members of the invisible committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges , terrorism included
overall , contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors
they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots , especially in countries such as canada , greece , and mexico
militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police ;
anarchists commonly employ direct action
this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy , or the form of self - managing their lives through the creation of counter - institutions such as communes and non - hierarchical collectives
contemporary - era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism , although not explicitly anarchist , respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations
in contrast with the big - a anarchism of the classical era , the newly coined term small - a anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical - era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as peter kropotkin and pierre - joseph proudhon to justify their opinions
those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize
as in the past , newspapers and journals are used , and anarchists have gone online in the world wide web to spread their message
anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties , hosting electronic libraries and other portals
anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces
during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied , they are often called temporary autonomous zones ( taz ) , spaces where art , poetry , and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal
acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds
as anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes , tendencies , and schools of thought ; disagreement over questions of values , ideology , and tactics is common
its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory
the compatibility of capitalism ,
as gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy , many anarchists address , analyse , and oppose the suppression of ones autonomy imposed by gender roles
sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing
a historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love
in contemporary anarchism , this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism
those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses , where large groups of travelers , anarchists and other activists slept in beds together
anarchist feminists were advocates of free love , against marriage , and pro - choice ( utilising a contemporary term ) , and had a similar agenda
anarchist and non - anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another
during the second half of the 20th century , anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism , radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well
by the latest decades of the 20th century , anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women , gays , queers and other marginalised groups , with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents
some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking , suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation
the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism
anarchists consider proper education , one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society , to be an act of mutual aid
in 1901 , catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church
christian anarchist leo tolstoy , who published the essay education and culture , also established a similar school with its founding principle being that for education to be effective it had to be free
anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a childs right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions ; however , there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation
ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality , liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism , along with other critiques of government and nationalism
late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ( paul goodman , herbert read , and colin ward ) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education , largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on childrens creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society
while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern - day , major tenets of anarchist schools , among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method , have spread among mainstream educational institutions
judith suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools , namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of a wider american - canadian network of schools , the self - managed learning college in brighton , england , and the paideia school in spain
specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary
robert paul wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate
bakunin saw the state as meaning coercion , domination by means of coercion , camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be
john simmons and leslie green , who leaned toward philosophical anarchism , believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus , although they saw this as highly unlikely
the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism , especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists , surrealists and others
in music , anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk
other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends
throughout the 20th century , many prominent anarchists ( peter kropotkin , emma goldman , gustav landauer and camillo berneri ) and publications such as anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts
three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists
it could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies , serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests
as it appeals to both emotion and reason , art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect
in les chataigniers a osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro , the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community
the most common critique of anarchism is that humans cannot self - govern and so a state is necessary for human survival
philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique , stating that peace and war , tariffs , regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs , the preservation of a just system of distribution these , among others , are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government
philosophy lecturer andrew fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction , not only in the pragmatic world , such as at protests , but in the world of ethics as well
secondly , anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically
this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it
the third argument is that anarchism is self - contradictory
while it advocates for no - one to archiei , if accepted by the many , then anarchism would turn into the ruling political theory
in this line of criticism also comes the self - contradiction that anarchism calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual , hence no collective action can be taken
lastly , fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective ( all talk and thoughts ) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong
philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro - anarchist books such as john simmons moral principles and political obligations
in the problem of political authority , michael huemer defends philosophical anarchism ,
one of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority
raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities successful and mistaken instruction
anarchist perception of human nature , rejection of the state , and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive , overly simplistic , and unrealistic , respectively
friedrich engels , considered to be one of the principal founders of marxism , criticised anarchisms anti - authoritarianism as inherently counter - revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian
the marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values
according to the marxist view , that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence
marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act
in the anarchist vision , the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining
kanner autism , or classic autism , is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by challenges with social communication , and by restricted and repetitive behaviors
it is now considered part of the wider autism spectrum
the term autism was historically used to refer specifically to kanner autism ,
parents often notice signs of autism during the first three years of their childs life
these signs often develop gradually , though some autistic children experience regression in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace
autism has been hypothesized to be associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors , factors which may influence likelihood of autism during pregnancy include certain infections , such as rubella , toxins including valproic acid , alcohol , cocaine , pesticides , lead , and air pollution , fetal growth restriction , - - gt ; and autoimmune diseases , but significant uncertainties remain about these
there is no treatment for autism as such , behavioral , psychological , education , and / or skill - building interventions may be used to assist autistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently , as well as other social , communication , and language skills
therapy also aims to reduce challenging behaviors and build upon strengths
an autistic culture has developed , with a minority of individuals seeking a cure ,
globally , classic autism was estimated to affect 24 million people the number of people diagnosed had increased considerably since the 1990s , which may be partly due to increased recognition of the condition
autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months , become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood , although often in more muted form
it was said to be distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction , impairments in communication , and repetitive behavior
other aspects , such as atypical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis
individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly , without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits
social deficits distinguish autism spectrum disorders from other developmental disorders
autistic people have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted
noted autistic woman temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals , or people with typical neural development , as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars
unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood
autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli , smile and look at others less often , and respond less to their own name
autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms ; for example , they have less eye contact and turn - taking , and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves , such as pointing at things
three - to five - year - old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding , approach others spontaneously , imitate and respond to emotions , communicate nonverbally , and take turns with others
however , they do form attachments to their primary caregivers
older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition
children with high - functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non - autistic peers , despite the common belief that autistic children prefer to be alone
making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for autistic people
for them , the quality of friendships , not the number of friends , predicts how lonely they feel
functional friendships , such as those resulting in invitations to parties , may affect the quality of life more deeply
there are many anecdotal reports , but few systematic studies , of aggression and violence in individuals with asd
the limited data suggest that , in children with intellectual disability , autism is associated with aggression , destruction of property , and meltdowns
about one third to half of autistic people do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs
in a pair of studies , high - functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as , and as adults better than , individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling
both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language , comprehension , and inference
as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills , these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends
autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior , which the repetitive behavior scale - revised ( rbs - r ) categorizes as follows
no single repetitive or self - injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism , but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors
autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis , but that can affect the individual or the family
this paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the us
an estimated 0 to 10 of individuals with asd show unusual abilities , ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants
sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 of autistic people , and are considered core features by some , differences are greater for under - responsivity ( for example , walking into things ) than for over - responsivity ( for example , distress from loud noises ) or for sensation seeking ( for example , rhythmic movements )
deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper
there is tentative evidence that gender dysphoria occurs more frequently in autistic people ( see autism and lgbt identities )
as well as that , a 2021 anonymized online survey of 16 - 90 year - olds revealed that autistic males are more likely to be bisexual , while autistic females are more likely to be homosexual
gastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly co - occurring medical conditions in autistic people
these are linked to greater social impairment , irritability , behavior and sleep problems , language impairments and mood changes
parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress
siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship
however , they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome ; siblings of individuals with asd have greater likelihood of negative well - being and poorer sibling relationships as adults
it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic , cognitive , and neural levels for autisms characteristic triad of symptoms however , there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co - occur
autism has a strong genetic basis , although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects , or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants
complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes , the environment , and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression
studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0 for autism and as high as 0 for asd , and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population
however , most of the mutations that increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of autism have not been identified
typically , autism cannot be traced to a mendelian ( single - gene ) mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality , and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd
numerous candidate genes have been located , with only small effects attributable to any particular gene
most loci individually explain less than 1 of cases of autism
autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition ,
maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment
intrauterine growth restriction is associated with asd , in both term and preterm infants
exposure to air pollution during pregnancy , especially heavy metals and particulates , may increase the likelihood of an autism diagnosis
environmental factors that have been claimed , without evidence , to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods , infectious diseases , solvents , pcbs , phthalates and phenols used in plastic products , pesticides , brominated flame retardants , alcohol , smoking , illicit drugs , vaccines ,
parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination
this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload , a vaccine preservative , or the mmr vaccine for causing autism
although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible , parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations , outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries , and the preventable deaths of several children
vaccines and autism
diagnosis is based on behavior , not cause or mechanism
under the dsm - 5 , autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts , as well as restricted , repetitive patterns of behavior , interests , or activities
these deficits are present in early childhood , typically before age three , and lead to clinically significant functional impairment
sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity , stereotyped and repetitive use of language or idiosyncratic language , and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects
the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome , intellectual disability or global developmental delay
icd - 10 uses essentially the same definition
several diagnostic instruments are available
two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic interview - revised ( adi - r ) is a semistructured parent interview , and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ( ados )
a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child
if warranted , diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists , observing and assessing cognitive , communication , family , and other factors using standardized tools , and taking into account any associated medical conditions
a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills , both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions
the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression
clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed , particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause
consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high - resolution chromosome and fragile x testing
a genotype - first model of diagnosis has been proposed , which would routinely assess the genomes copy number variations
metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful , but are not routine
asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months , although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example , a one - year - old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three - year - old to continue to do so a few years later
in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment , though few cases are handled that quickly in practice
although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood , they are sometimes missed ; years later , adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves , to help their employers make adjustments , or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits
signs of autism may be more challenging for clinicians to detect in females
autistic females have been shown to engage in masking more frequently than autistic males
masking may include making oneself perform normative facial expressions and eye contact
a notable percentage of autistic females may be misdiagnosed , diagnosed after a considerable delay , or not diagnosed at all
conversely , the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis
the fourth edition of the american psychiatric associations diagnostic manual , dsm - iv , listed autistic disorder as one of the five pervasive developmental disorders ( pdd ) , but these were collapsed into the single diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in 2013 , ) followed suit a few years later
it was said to be characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication , severely restricted interests , and highly repetitive behavior
these symptoms do not imply sickness , fragility , or emotional disturbance
of the five pdd forms , asperger syndrome was closest to classic autism in signs and likely causes ; rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with it , but may have unrelated causes ; pdd not otherwise specified ( pdd - nos ; also called atypical autism ) was diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder
but studies found that early language ability was a poor predictor of outcomes in adulthood
research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes ( observable traits ) that can be viewed on brain scans , to help further neurogenetic studies of autism ; it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior

autism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum , ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent , developmentally disabled , and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches , narrowly focused interests , and verbose , pedantic communication
the main goals when treating autistic children are to lessen associated deficits and family distress , and to increase quality of life and functional independence
in general , higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes
families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment
services should be carried out by behavior analysts , special education teachers , speech pathologists , and licensed psychologists
studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy
although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence , suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment , the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor , their clinical results are mostly tentative , and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options
claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated
educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis ( aba ) , developmental models , structured teaching , speech and language therapy , social skills therapy , and occupational therapy and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression , anxiety , and obsessive - compulsive disorder
two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic aba interventions , and developmental social pragmatic models ( dsp )
one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model , which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques , allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves
various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at - home parent implementation
despite the recent development of parent training models , these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies , being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment
early , intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children ; the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers
medications may be used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails
however , their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits , and autistic people may respond atypically
side effects , for example , may include weight gain , tiredness , drooling , and aggression
ssri antidepressants , such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine , have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors , while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co - morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity
there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd
experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function , suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism
although many alternative therapies and interventions are available , few are supported by scientific studies
treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality - of - life contexts , and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real - world relevance
some alternative treatments may place the child at risk
the preference that autistic children have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on casein - free diets , as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin d ; however , suboptimal bone development in asd has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disorders
another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy , a mixture of homeopathy , supplements , and vaccine detoxing
although popularly used as an alternative treatment for autistic people , a 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism , such as those with known food intolerances or allergies , or with food intolerance markers
the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten - and casein - free diet in children with asd ( 4 in total )
all of them compared gluten - and casein - free diet versus normal diet with a control group ( 2 double - blind randomized controlled trials , 1 double - blind crossover trial , 1 single - blind trial )
in two of the studies , whose duration was 12 and 24 months , a significant improvement in asd symptoms ( efficacy rate 50 ) was identified
in the other two studies , whose duration was 3 months , no significant effect was observed
the authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the asd symptoms other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet , small sample size , the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect
results of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support mindfulness - based interventions for improving mental health
this includes decreasing stress , anxiety , ruminating thoughts , anger , and aggression
there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions , verbal communication , and non - verbal communication skills
there is no known cure for autism
the degree of symptoms can decrease , occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of asd ; many autistic children lack social support , future employment opportunities or self - determination
although core difficulties tend to persist , symptoms often become less severe with age
few high - quality studies address long - term prognosis
some adults show modest improvement in communication skills , but a few decline ; no study has focused on autism after midlife
autistic people tend to face increased stress levels related to psychosocial factors , such as stigma , which may increase the rates of mental health issues in the autistic population
globally , classic autism was understood to affect an estimated 24 million people ( particularly among women )
vaccination does not cause autism ( or asd ) and is not behind any increase in autism prevalence rates , if any change in the rate of autism exists at all
males had higher likelihood of being diagnosed with autism than females
the sex ratio averaged 4 and was greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may have been close to 21 with intellectual disability and more than 5 without
a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named
the table talk of martin luther , compiled by his notetaker , mathesius , contains the story of a 12 - year - old boy who may have been severely autistic
the wild boy of aveyron , a feral child caught in 1798 , showed several signs of autism ; the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation
the new latin word autismus ( english translation autism ) was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia
he derived it from the greek word autós ( αὐτός , meaning self ) , and used it to mean morbid self - admiration , referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies , against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance
the word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleulers terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology
kanners reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia , and child psychiatrys focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infants response to refrigerator mothers
starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome
as late as the mid - 1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism , while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions
and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research
it took until 1980 for the dsm - iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia
in 1987 , the dsm - iii - r provided a checklist for diagnosing autism
in may 2013 , the dsm - 5 was released , updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders
the grouping of disorders , including pdd - nos , autism , asperger syndrome , rett syndrome , and cdd , has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders
the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and / or interaction , and restricted and / or repetitive behaviors
the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely
an autistic culture has emerged , accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements
events include world autism awareness day , autism sunday , autistic pride day , autreat , and others
social science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as a culture , transcultural comparisons and research on social movements
the autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity , viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured
the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic behaviors ; therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism , and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group
autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome
this perspective is distinct from fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines
a common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are high - functioning or have asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of low - functioning autistic people
about half of autistic people are unemployed , and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed
while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision , experienced employers of autistic people give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees
a majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market
albedo is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from 0 , corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation , to 1 , corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation
surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity je to the irradiance ee ( flux per unit area ) received by a surface
these factors vary with atmospheric composition , geographic location , and time ( see position of the sun )
while bi - hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence ( that is , for a given position of the sun ) , albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period
the temporal resolution may range from seconds ( as obtained from flux measurements ) to daily , monthly , or annual averages
unless given for a specific wavelength ( spectral albedo ) , albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation
due to measurement constraints , it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface ( between 0 and 3 μm )
this spectrum includes visible light ( 0–0 μm ) , which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark ( for example , trees absorb most radiation ) , whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright ( for example , snow reflects most radiation )
albedo is an important concept in climatology , astronomy , and environmental management ( for example , as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design ( leed ) program for sustainable rating of buildings )
the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere , its planetary albedo , is 30–35 because of cloud cover , but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features
the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometria
any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0 for fresh snow to about 0 for charcoal , one of the darkest substances
deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body
when seen from a distance , the ocean surface has a low albedo , as do most forests , whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of 0 to 0
the average albedo of earth is about 0
this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds
earths surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasas modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites , and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss
as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite , not all directions , a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional - hemispherical reflectance and bi - hemispherical reflectance ( for example , )
these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( brdf ) , which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle
bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo
earths average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about
if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers , the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about
in 2021 , scientists reported that earth dimmed by 0 over two decades ( 1998 - 2017 ) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques
this may have both been co - caused by climate change as well as a substantial increase in global warming
however , the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend
for land surfaces , it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle θi can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms
with 1 - d being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle , and d being the proportion of diffuse illumination , the actual albedo alpha ( also called blue - sky albedo ) can then be given as
this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface
albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light , except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earths surface at that location ( for example through melting of reflective ice )
that said , albedo and illumination both vary by latitude
albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics , with a local maximum in the tropics
the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation ( solar irradiance ) ; high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation , whereas areas such as the sahara desert , which also have a relatively high albedo , will be hotter due to high insolation
tropical and sub - tropical rainforest areas have low albedo , and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts , which have lower insolation
because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo , high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes
arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb , effectively cooling the earth
this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures , creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker ( being water or ground which is darker color ) and reflects less heat back into space
this feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect
albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs
the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land , ice , or ocean surfaces can drive weather
when an areas albedo changes due to snowfall , a snow–temperature feedback results
a layer of snowfall increases local albedo , reflecting away sunlight , leading to local cooling
in principle , if no outside temperature change affects this area ( for example , a warm air mass ) , the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall , deepening the snow–temperature feedback
however , because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons , eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight ( higher insolation ) cause melting
when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo , such as grass , soil , or ocean , the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo , increasing local temperatures , which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further , resulting in still more heating
snow albedo is highly variable , ranging from as high as 0 for freshly fallen snow , to about 0 for melting snow , and as low as 0 for dirty snow
over antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 0
if a marginally snow - covered area warms , snow tends to melt , lowering the albedo , and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack ( the ice–albedo positive feedback )
just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow , the albedo of snow - covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water
sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow
when sea ice melts , either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above , the snow - covered surface is reduced , and more surface of sea water is exposed , so the rate of energy absorption increases
the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water , which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts
as with the preceding example of snowmelt , the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback
both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming
cryoconite , powdery windblown dust containing soot , sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets

the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback , together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo , can lead to large errors in energy estimates
because of this , in order to reduce the error of energy estimates , it is important to measure the albedo of snow - covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions
albedo works on a smaller scale , too
in sunlight , dark clothes absorb more heat and light - coloured clothes reflect it better , thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing
albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices
for example , the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon ( a - sih ) and crystalline silicon ( c - si ) - based compared to traditional spectral - integrated albedo predictions
research showed impacts of over 10
because forests generally have a low albedo , ( the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis ) , some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation ( or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation )
in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect
trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration
the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface , causes heating where it condenses , acts a strong greenhouse gas , and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds
in seasonally snow - covered zones , winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 to 50 higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily
deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0 to 0 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0 to 0
variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy
cite journal
the result is that wavelengths of light not used in photosynthesis are more likely to be reflected back to space rather than being absorbed by other surfaces lower in the canopy
studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative ( generally warming ) effect of albedo change and ( cooling ) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests
they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool ; new forests in high latitudes ( for example , siberia ) were neutral or perhaps warming
water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials
the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations
at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner ( not diffusely )
the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this
at small angles of incident light , waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity - vs
- incident - angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle
although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light , it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator ( early morning , late afternoon , and near the poles )
however , as mentioned above , waviness causes an appreciable reduction
because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer , water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light
note that white caps on waves look white ( and have high albedo ) because the water is foamed up , so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect , adding up their reflectivities
fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection
cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures
different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity , theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0
on any given day , about half of earth is covered by clouds , which reflect more sunlight than land and water
clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight , but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth
albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds , such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic
aerosols ( very fine particles / droplets in the atmosphere ) have both direct and indirect effects on earths radiative balance
the direct ( albedo ) effect is generally to cool the planet ; the indirect effect ( the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties ) is less certain
as per spracklen and others the effects are
in extremely polluted cities like delhi , aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an urban cool island effect during the day
another albedo - related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles
the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is 0 w m−2 , with a range 0 to 0 w m−2
human activities ( for example , deforestation , farming , and urbanization ) change the albedo of various areas around the globe
however , quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult , further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects
in astronomy , the term albedo can be defined in several different ways , depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved
the albedos of planets , satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties
the study of albedos , their dependence on wavelength , lighting angle ( phase angle ) , and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry
for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes , much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos
for example , the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects , the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties , whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids
enceladus , a moon of saturn , has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the solar system , with an albedo of 0
another notable high - albedo body is eris , with an albedo of 0
but it is strongly directional and non - lambertian , displaying also a strong opposition effect
although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains , they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies
two common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the ( v - band ) geometric albedo ( measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer ) and the bond albedo ( measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected )
their values can differ significantly , which is a common source of confusion
in detailed studies , the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi - empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle , including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces
one of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the single - scattering albedo
it is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles
it depends on properties of the material ( refractive index ) , the size of the particle , and the wavelength of the incoming radiation
an important relationship between an objects astronomical ( geometric ) albedo , absolute magnitude and diameter is given bycite web
where a is the astronomical albedo , d is the diameter in kilometers , and h is the absolute magnitude
in planetary radar astronomy , a microwave ( or radar ) pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target ( for example moon , asteroid , etcetera ) and the echo from the target is measured
in most instances , the transmitted pulse is circularly polarized and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse ( sc ) and the opposite sense ( oc )
the echo power is measured in terms of radar cross - section , sigmaoc , sigmasc , or sigmat ( total power , sc oc ) and is equal to the cross - sectional area of a metallic sphere ( perfect reflector ) at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power
those components of the received echo that return from first - surface reflections ( as from a smooth or mirror - like surface ) are dominated by the oc component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection
if the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith , there will be a significant sc component in the echo caused by multiple scattering
for most objects in the solar system , the oc echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the ( normalized ) oc radar albedo ( often shortened to radar albedo )
where the denominator is the effective cross - sectional area of the target object with mean radius , r
a smooth metallic sphere would have hatsigmaoc 1
the values reported for the moon , mercury , mars , venus , and comet p / 2005 jq5 are derived from the total ( ocsc ) radar albedo reported in those references
in the event that most of the echo is from first surface reflections ( hatsigmaoc or so ) , the oc radar albedo is a first - order approximation of the fresnel reflection coefficient ( aka reflectivity ) and can be used to estimate the bulk density of a planetary surface to a depth of a meter or so ( a few wavelengths of the radar wavelength which is typically at the decimeter scale ) using the following empirical relationships

a , or a , is the first letter and the first vowel of the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet
the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle , crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar
the lowercase version can be written in two forms the double - storey a and single - storey ɑ
the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it , especially fonts intended to be read by children , and is also found in italic type
the earliest certain ancestor of a is aleph ( also written aleph ) , the first letter of the phoenician alphabet , influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs , styled as a triangular head with two horns extended
when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet , they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages , and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha
in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages , dating to the 8th century bc , the letter rests upon its side , but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter , although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg , or by the angle at which the cross line is set
the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged
the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language , and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages , including english
during roman times , there were many variant forms of the letter first was the monumental or lapidary style , which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media
there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing , which was done on more perishable surfaces
due to the perishable nature of these surfaces , there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental , but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive , such as majuscule cursive , minuscule cursive , and semicursive minuscule
variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles
the known variants include the early semi - uncial , the uncial , and the later semi - uncial
at the end of the roman empire ( 5th century ad ) , several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe
among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy , the merovingian script in france , the visigothic script in spain , and the insular or anglo - irish semi - uncial or anglo - saxon majuscule of great britain
by the 9th century , the caroline script , which was very similar to the present - day form , was the principal form used in book - making , before the advent of the printing press
this form was derived through a combining of prior forms
15th - century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today
these variants , the italic and roman forms , were derived from the caroline script version
the italic form , also called script a , is used in most current handwriting ; it consists of a circle and vertical stroke on the right ( ɑ )
this slowly developed from the fifth - century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers
the roman form is used in most printed material ; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ( a )
both derive from the majuscule ( capital ) form
in greek handwriting , it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop , as demonstrated by the uncial version shown
many fonts then made the right leg vertical
in some of these , the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc , resulting in the printed form , while in others it was dropped , resulting in the modern handwritten form
graphic designers refer to the italic and roman forms as single decker a and double decker a respectively
italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest ( set in roman type )
there are some other cases aside from italic type where script a ( ɑ ) , also called latin alpha , is used in contrast with latin a ( such as in the international phonetic alphabet )
in algebra , the letter a along with various other letters of the alphabet is often used to denote a variable , with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics
moreover , in 1637 , rené descartes invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x , y , and z , and knowns by a , b , and c , and this convention is still often followed , especially in elementary algebra
in geometry , capital a , b , c etcetera are used to denote segments , lines , rays , etcetera a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle , the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle
a is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status a− , a or a , the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students schoolwork ; a grade for clean restaurants ; a - list celebrities , etcetera such associations can have a motivating effect , as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance , when compared with other letters
a is used as a prefix on some words , such as asymmetry , to mean not or without ( from greek )
in english grammar , a , and its variant an , is an indefinite article , used to introduce noun phrases
finally , the letter a is used to denote size , as in a narrow size shoe , or a small cup size in a brassiere
in the hexadecimal ( base 16 ) numbering system , a is a number that corresponds to the number 10 in decimal ( base 10 ) counting
alabama is nicknamed the yellowhammer state , after the state bird
alabama is also known as the heart of dixie and the cotton state
the state tree is the longleaf pine , and the state flower is the camellia
alabamas capital is montgomery , and its largest city by population and area is huntsville
greater birmingham is alabamas largest metropolitan area and its economic center
originally home to many native tribes , present - day alabama was a spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the french acquired it in the early eighteenth century
the british won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the american revolutionary war
spain held mobile as part of spanish west florida until 1813
in december 1819 , alabama was recognized as a state
during the antebellum period , alabama was a major producer of cotton , and widely used african american slave labor
in 1861 , the state seceded from the united states to become part of the confederate states of america , with montgomery acting as its first capital , and rejoined the union in 1868
following the american civil war , alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship , in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the states economy
similar to other former slave states , alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws which disenfranchised and discriminated against african americans and also alabamas french creole population from the late 19th century up until the 1960s
in the early 20th century , despite the growth of major industries and urban centers , white rural interests dominated the state legislature through the mid - 20th century
during this time , urban interests and african americans were markedly under - represented
high - profile events such as the selma to montgomery march made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s
during and after world war ii , alabama grew as the states economy diversified with new industries
nasas marshall space flight center in huntsville would help alabamas economic growth in the mid - to - late 20th century , by developing an aerospace industry
alabamas economy in the 21st century is based on automotive , finance , tourism , manufacturing , aerospace , mineral extraction , healthcare , education , retail , and technology
the states geography is diverse , with the north dominated by the mountainous tennessee valley and the south by mobile bay , a historically significant port
politically , as part of the deep south , alabama is predominantly a conservative state , and culturally is known for its southern culture
within alabama , american football , particularly at the college level at schools such as the university of alabama , auburn university , alabama am university , alabama state university , troy university , the university of south alabama , and jacksonville state university , play a major part of the states culture
the european - american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people , a muskogean - speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river
( or variously in different dialects ; the plural form is the suggestion that alabama was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely
the words spelling varies significantly among historical sources
the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of 1540 garcilaso de la vega used , with french maps identifying the river as the use of state names derived from native american languages is common in the ; an estimated 27 states have names of native american origin
sources disagree on the words meaning
some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw ( meaning to cut , to trim , or to gather )
the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers , however , there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language
an 1842 article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest
this notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek
experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation
indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization
trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period ( 1000700
the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 ce , with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville , alabama
this is the second - largest complex of the classic middle mississippian era , after cahokia in present - day illinois , which was the center of the culture
analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex ( secc )
among the historical tribes of native american people living in present - day alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee , an iroquoian language people ; and the muskogean - speaking alabama ( alibamu ) , chickasaw , choctaw , creek , and koasati
while part of the same large language family , the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages
the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama during their exploration of north america in the 16th century
the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in 1540
more than 160 years later , the french founded the regions first european settlement at old mobile in 1702
the city was moved to the current site of mobile in 1711
this area was claimed by the french from 1702 to 1763 as part of la louisiane
after the french lost to the british in the seven years war , it became part of british west florida from 1763 to 1783
after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war , the territory was divided between the united states and spain
the latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to forces on april 13 , 1813
thomas bassett , a loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era , was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile
he settled in the tombigbee district during the early 1770s
what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in 1783 , part of the independent republic of west florida in 1810 , and was finally added to the mississippi territory in 1812
most of what is now the northern two - thirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period
it was claimed by the province of georgia from 1767 onwards
following the revolutionary war , it remained a part of georgia , although heavily disputed
with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands , what is now the lower one - third of alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in 1798
the yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804 , following the yazoo land scandal
spain kept a claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adams–onís treaty officially ceded it to the united states in 1819
before mississippis admission to statehood on december 10 , 1817 , the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory
the united states congress created the alabama territory on march 3 , 1817
stephens , now abandoned , served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819
alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on december 14 , 1819 , with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention
from july
cahaba , now a ghost town , was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825
part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s , its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men
southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded
the economy of the central black belt ( named for its dark , productive soil ) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners wealth grew mainly from slave labor
the area also drew many poor , disenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers
alabama had an estimated population of under 10 , 000 people in 1810 , but it increased to more than 300 , 000 people by 1830
most native american tribes were completely removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in 1830
from 1826 to 1846 , tuscaloosa served as alabamas capital
on january 30 , 1846 , the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery
the first legislative session in the new capital met in december 1847
by 1860 , the population had increased to 964 , 201 people , of which nearly half , 435 , 080 , were enslaved african americans , and 2 , 690 were free people of color
on january 11 , 1861 , alabama declared its secession from the union
after remaining an independent republic for a few days , it joined the confederate states of america
the confederacys capital was initially at montgomery
alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war
although comparatively few battles were fought in the state , alabama contributed about 120 , 000 soldiers to the war effort
a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville , alabama , joined nathan bedford forrests battalion in hopkinsville , kentucky
the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves , collar and coattails
this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer , and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army
following the war , the state remained chiefly agricultural , with an economy tied to cotton
during reconstruction , state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which created the states first public school system and expanded womens rights
legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects , although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation
organized insurgent , resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans
besides the short - lived original ku klux klan , these included the pale faces , knights of the white camellia , red shirts , and the white league
reconstruction in alabama ended in 1874 , when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office through an election dominated by fraud and violence
they wrote another constitution in 1875 , and the legislature passed the blaine amendment , prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious - affiliated schools
railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891
the new 1901 constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population , including nearly all african americans and native americans , and tens of thousands of poor european americans , through making voter registration difficult , requiring a poll tax and literacy test
the 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools
by 1903 only 2 , 980 african americans were registered in alabama , although at least 74 , 000 were literate
this compared to more than 181 , 000 african americans eligible to vote in 1900
the numbers dropped even more in later decades
the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s jails were segregated in 1911 ; hospitals in 1915 ; toilets , hotels , and restaurants in 1928 ; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945
while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting , the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well , due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax
by 1941 , whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws 600 , 000 whites vs
520 , 000 african - americans

nearly all blacks had lost the ability to vote
despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions , the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement
the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens
the rural - dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans , but it did not relieve them of paying taxes

beginning in 1913 , the first 80 rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african - american children
a total of 387 schools , seven teachers houses , and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state
several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places
continued racial discrimination and lynchings , agricultural depression , and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the great migration out of the south
at the same time , many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs
birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the magic city
by 1920 , birmingham was the 36th - largest city in the united states
industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war
rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living
one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile
between 1940 and 1943 , more than 89 , 000 people moved into the city to work for war - related industries
cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base
despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 , the rural - dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population , as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses
they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas
one result was that jefferson county , containing birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse , contributed more than one - third of all tax revenue to the state , but did not receive a proportional amount in services
urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature
a 1960 study noted that because of rural domination , a minority of about 25 of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature
in the united states supreme court cases of baker v
carr ( 1962 ) and reynolds v
sims ( 1964 ) , the court ruled that the principle of one man , one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures , and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties
african americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement , including legal challenges
in 1954 , the supreme court ruled in brown v
board of education that public schools had to be desegregated , but alabama was slow to comply
during the 1960s , under governor george wallace , alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation
the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama , including the montgomery bus boycott ( 1955–1956 ) , freedom rides in 1961 , and 1965 selma to montgomery marches
legal segregation ended in the states in 1964 , but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court
in 1972 , for the first time since 1901 , the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census
this benefited the urban areas that had developed , as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years
other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts
alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation
in the 1980s , an omnibus redistricting case , dillard v
crenshaw county , challenged the at - large voting for representative seats of 180 alabama jurisdictions , including counties and school boards
at - large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county , as the majority tended to take all seats
despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state , they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at - large jurisdictions
as part of settlement of this case , five alabama cities and counties , including chilton county , adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi - seat jurisdictions
this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters
in another form of proportional representation , 23 jurisdictions use limited voting , as in conecuh county
in 1982 , limited voting was first tested in conecuh county
together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices , resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens
beginning in the 1960s , the states economy shifted away from its traditional lumber , steel , and textile industries because of increased foreign competition
steel jobs , for instance , declined from 46 , 314 in 1950 to 14 , 185 in 2011
in 2001 , alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore installed a statue of the ten commandments in the capitol in montgomery
in 2002 , the 11th us circuit court ordered the statue removed , but moore refused to follow the court order , which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument
the monument was removed in august 2003
a few natural disasters have occurred in the state in the twenty - first century

the foundational document for alabamas government is the alabama constitution , which was ratified in 1901
with over 850 amendments and almost 87 , 000 words , it is by some accounts the worlds longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the united states constitution
there has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize alabamas constitution
critics argue that alabamas constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature , leaving practically no power in local hands
most counties do not have home rule
any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire alabama legislature and , frequently , by state referendum
one criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism
alabamas government is divided into three coequal branches
the legislative branch is the alabama legislature , a bicameral assembly composed of the alabama house of representatives , with 105 members , and the alabama senate , with 35 members
the legislature is responsible for writing , debating , passing , or defeating state legislation
the republican party currently holds a majority in both houses of the legislature
the legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority ( most state legislatures require a two - thirds majority to override a veto )
until 1964 , the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county , with one per county
it had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901 ; as a result , urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented
it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses , either
in reynolds v
sims ( 1964 ) , the supreme court implemented the principle of one man , one vote , ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses ( as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented
) further , the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population , as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems
at that time , alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting , as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts
this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas
for instance , birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one - third of the state budget , but jefferson county received only 1 / 67th of state services in funding
through the legislative delegations , the alabama legislature kept control of county governments
the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws
it is headed by the governor of alabama
other members of the executive branch include the cabinet , the lieutenant governor of alabama , the attorney general of alabama , the alabama secretary of state , the alabama state treasurer , and the state auditor of alabama
the current governor is republican kay ivey
the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections
statewide officials , such as the governor , lieutenant governor , attorney general , and other constitutional officers , take office the following january
the judiciary is responsible for interpreting the constitution of alabama and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases
the states highest court is the supreme court of alabama
alabama uses partisan elections to select judges
since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized

the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican tom parker
all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party
there are two intermediate appellate courts , the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals , and four trial courts the circuit court ( trial court of general jurisdiction ) , and the district , probate , and municipal courts
some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions
some of its cases have been highly controversial ; the supreme court has overturned
the states general sales tax rate is 4
for example , the total sales tax rate in mobile county , alabama is 10 and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1 , which means a diner in mobile county , alabama would pay an 11 tax on a meal
the corporate income tax rate in alabama is 6
the overall federal , state , and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax - burdened state in the country
property taxes of
40 of assessed value per year , are the second - lowest in the , after hawaii
the current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes
alabama has 67 counties
each county has its own elected legislative branch , usually called the county commission
it also has limited executive authority in the county
because of the constraints of the alabama constitution , which centralizes power in the state legislature , only seven counties ( jefferson , lee , mobile , madison , montgomery , shelby , and tuscaloosa ) in the state have limited home rule
instead , most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved , ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning
the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties , as recommended by the 1973 alabama constitutional commission
legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county
united states supreme court decisions in baker v
carr ( 1964 ) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population , and redistricted after each census , to implement the principle of one man , one vote
before that , each county was represented by one state senator , leading to under - representation in the state senate for more urbanized , populous counties
the rural bias of the state legislature , which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house , affected politics well into the 20th century , failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas
the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution
alabamas constitution has been amended more than 700 times , and almost one - third of the amendments are local in nature , applying to only one county or city
a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation , taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance
alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state , meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol
the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state
a total of 25 of the 67 counties are dry counties which ban the sale of alcohol , and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales
during reconstruction following the american civil war , alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope
in 1874 , the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans , in part by suppressing the black vote through violence , fraud , and intimidation
after 1890 , a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents , a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution
provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites
by 1941 more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised 600 , 000 to 520 , 000
the total effects were greater on the black community , as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law
from 1901 through the 1960s , the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas
as counties were the basis of election districts , the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three - quarters of the century , until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation
alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement , when whites bureaucratically , and at times violently , resisted protests for electoral and social reform
governor george wallace , the states only four - term governor , was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation
only after passage of the federal civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage , among other civil rights
in many jurisdictions , they continued to be excluded from representation by at - large electoral systems , which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections
some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single - member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards
in 2007 , the alabama legislature passed , and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing profound regret over slavery and its lingering impact
in a symbolic ceremony , the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol , which housed congress of the confederate states of america
in 2010 , republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years
with the disfranchisement of blacks in 1901 , the state became part of the solid south , a system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state
for nearly a hundred years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary , with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election
since the mid - to late 20th century , however , white conservatives started shifting to the republican party
in alabama , majority - white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal , state and local office
members of the nine seats on the supreme court of alabama hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court
the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 2011 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench
in the early 21st century , republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices
republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education
in 2010 , republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature , giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years
the last remaining statewide democrat , who served on the alabama public service commission , was defeated in 2012
only three republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction , when republicans generally represented reconstruction government , including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise
the three gop lieutenant governors are steve windom ( 1999–2003 ) , kay ivey ( 2011–2017 ) , and will ainsworth ( 2019–present )
many local offices ( county commissioners , boards of education , tax assessors , tax collectors , etcetera ) in the state are still held by democrats
many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats , resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary
similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority - republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary , although there are exceptions
alabamas 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan , at - large races , and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts
the current split is 35 democrats , 31 republicans , and one independent fayette
, the state of alabama has one female sheriff , in morgan county , alabama , and ten african - american sheriffs
the states two senators are richard shelby and tommy tuberville , both of whom are republican
shelby was originally elected to the senate as a democrat in 1986 and re - elected in 1992 , but switched parties immediately following the november 1994 general election
in the house of representatives , the state is represented by seven members , six of whom are republicans ( jerry carl , mike rogers , robert aderholt , mo brooks , barry moore , and gary palmer ) and one democrat terri sewell , who represents the black belt as well as most of the predominantly black portions of birmingham , tuscaloosa and montgomery

in greek mythology , achilles or achilleus was a hero of the trojan war , the greatest of all the greek warriors , and is the central character of homers iliad
he was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus , king of phthia
achilles most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan prince hector outside the gates of troy
although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad , other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris , who shot him with an arrow
later legends ( beginning with statius unfinished epic achilleid , written in the 1st century ad ) state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel , because when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant , she held him by one of his heels
alluding to these legends , the term achilles heel has come to mean a point of weakness , especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution
the achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends
linear b tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms a - ki - re - u and a - ki - re - we , accessed 5 may 2017
the latter being the dative of the former
the name grew more popular , even becoming common soon after the seventh century bc and was also turned into the female form ἀχιλλεία ( achilleía ) , attested in attica in the fourth century bc ( ig ii² 1617 ) and , in the form achillia , on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an amazon
achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of ) distress , pain , sorrow , grief and ) people , soldiers , nation , resulting in a proto - form akhí - lāu̯os he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress
the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the iliad ( and frequently by achilles himself )
achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of ( glory , usually in war )
furthermore , laós has been construed by gregory nagy , following leonard palmer , to mean a corps of soldiers , a muster
with this derivation , the name obtains a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly , his men bring distress to the enemy , but when wrongly , his men get the grief of war
the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership
some researchers deem the name a loan word , possibly from a pre - greek language
achilles descent from the nereid thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about his being an old water divinity ( see below worship )
robert beekes has suggested a pre - greek origin of the name , based among other things on the coexistence of - λλ - and - λ - in epic language , which may account for a palatalized phoneme / ly / in the original language
robert beekes , etymological dictionary of greek , brill , 2009 , pp
achilles was the son of the thetis , a nereid , and peleus , the king of the myrmidons
zeus and poseidon had been rivals for thetiss hand in marriage until prometheus , the fore - thinker , warned zeus of a prophecy ( originally uttered by themis , goddess of divine law ) that thetis would bear a son greater than his father
for this reason , the two gods withdrew their pursuit , and had her wed peleus
there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in the argonautica ( 4 ) zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus , pointing out that thetis was so loyal to heras marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods
thetis , although a daughter of the sea - god nereus , was also brought up by hera , further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus
zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal
according to the achilleid , written by statius in the 1st century ad , and to non - surviving previous sources , when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx ; however , he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel ( see achilles heel , achilles tendon )
it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier
in another version of this story , thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body
she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage
none of the sources before statius make any reference to this general invulnerability
to the contrary , in the iliad , homer mentions achilles being wounded in book 21 the paeonian hero asteropaeus , son of pelagon , challenged achilles by the river scamander
he was ambidextrous , and cast a spear from each hand ; one grazed achilles elbow , drawing a spurt of blood
in the few fragmentary poems of the epic cycle which describe the heros death ( that is the cypria , the little iliad by lesches of pyrrha , the aithiopis and iliou persis by arctinus of miletus ) , there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel
in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles , the arrow ( or in many cases , arrows ) hit his torso
peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur , who lived on mount pelion , to be reared
thetis foretold that her sons fate was either to gain glory and die young , or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity
achilles chose the former , and decided to take part in the trojan war
according to homer , achilles grew up in phthia with his companion patroclus
according to photius , the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by peleus
when she had achilles , peleus noticed , tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot , and confided him to the centaur chiron
later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus , who was the fastest of all the giants , removed the ankle , and incorporated it into achilles burnt foot
it is said
that he akhilleus ( achilles ) was called podarkes ( podarces , swift - footed ) by the poet that is homer , because , it is said , thetis gave the newborn child the wings of arke ( arce ) and podarkes means that his feet had the wings of arke
and arke was the daughter of thaumas and her sister was iris ; both had wings , but , during the struggle of the gods against the titanes ( titans ) , arke flew out of the camp of the gods and joined the titanes
after the victory zeus removed her wings before throwing her into tartaros and , when he came to the wedding of peleus and thetis , he brought these wings as a gift for thetis
some post - homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war , thetis ( or , in some versions , peleus ) hid the young man at the court of lycomedes , king of skyros
there , achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among lycomedes daughters , perhaps under the name pyrrha ( the red - haired girl ) , cercysera or aissa ( swift with lycomedes daughter deidamia , whom in the account of statius he raped , achilles there fathered two sons , neoptolemus ( also called pyrrhus , after his fathers possible alias ) and oneiros
according to this story , odysseus learned from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid
odysseus went to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling womens clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods
when achilles instantly took up the spear , odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the greek campaign
in another version of the story , odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women
while the women fled in panic , achilles prepared to defend the court , thus giving his identity away
according to the iliad , achilles arrived at troy with 50 ships , each carrying 50 myrmidons
he appointed five leaders ( each leader commanding 500 myrmidons ) menesthius , eudorus , peisander , phoenix and alcimedon
when the greeks left for the trojan war , they accidentally stopped in mysia , ruled by king telephus
in the resulting battle , achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal ; telephus consulted an oracle , who stated that he that wounded shall heal
guided by the oracle , he arrived at argos , where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy
according to other reports in euripides lost play about telephus , he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound
achilles refused , claiming to have no medical knowledge
alternatively , telephus held orestes for ransom , the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound
odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound ; therefore , the spear must be able to heal it
pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed
according to the cypria ( the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles wrath ) , when the achaeans desired to return home , they were restrained by achilles , who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas , sacked neighbouring cities ( like pedasus and lyrnessus , where the greeks capture the queen briseis ) and killed tenes , a son of apollo , as well as priams son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios ; however , the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucers troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeares troilus and cressida is a medieval invention
in dares phrygius account of the destruction of troy , the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe , as well as in older accounts , troilus was a young trojan prince , the youngest of king priams and hecubas five legitimate sons ( or according other sources , another son of apollo )
despite his youth , he was one of the main trojan war leaders , a horse fighter or chariot fighter according to homer
prophecies linked troilus fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him
yet achilles , struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena , and overcome with lust , directed his sexual attentions on the youth– who , refusing to yield , instead found himself decapitated upon an altar - omphalos of apollo thymbraios

html troilus greekmythology
com accessed 30 september 2019 later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over - ardent lovers embrace
in this version of the myth , achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege
ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents
had troilus lived to adulthood , the first vatican mythographer claimed , troy would have been invincible ; however , the motif is older and found already in plautus bacchides
homers iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war
achilles wrath ( μῆνις ἀχιλλέως , mênis achilléōs ) is the central theme of the poem
the first two lines of the iliad read
the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade - long war , and does not narrate achilles death
it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon , the commander of the achaean forces
agamemnon has taken a woman named chryseis as his slave
her father chryses , a priest of apollo , begs agamemnon to return her to him
agamemnon refuses , and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks
the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him
achilles does so , and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father
agamemnon consents , but then commands that achilles battle prize briseis , the daughter of briseus , be brought to him to replace chryseis
angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away ( and , as he says later , because he loves briseis ) , with the urging of his mother thetis , achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces
at the same time , burning with rage over agamemnons theft , achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war , so that he may regain his honour
as the battle turns against the greeks , thanks to the influence of zeus , nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles , and urges the king to appease the warrior
agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains , ajax and phoenix
they promise that , if achilles returns to battle , agamemnon will return the captive briseis and other gifts
achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do
the trojans , led by hector , subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships
with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction , patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle , wearing achilles armour , though achilles remains at his camp
patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches , but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy
after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus , the son of nestor , achilles grieves over his beloved companions death
his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles
she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him , in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing , which was taken by hector
the new armour includes the shield of achilles , described in great detail in the poem
enraged over the death of patroclus , achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field , killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector
achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander , who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed
the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus
zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction , seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself
finally , achilles finds his prey
achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena , in the form of hectors favorite and dearest brother , deiphobus , persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face
after hector realizes the trick , he knows the battle is inevitable
wanting to go down fighting , he charges at achilles with his only weapon , his sword , but misses
accepting his fate , hector begs achilles not to spare his life , but to treat his body with respect after killing him
achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him , declaring that my rage , my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me
achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot
after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral , achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion
at the onset of his duel with hector , achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky , which comes on in the autumn , orions dog ( sirius ) ; a sign of evil
during the cremation of patroclus , he is compared to hesperus , the evening / western star ( venus ) , while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until phosphorus , the morning / eastern star ( also venus ) has set ( descended )
with the assistance of the god hermes ( argeiphontes ) , hectors father priam goes to achilles tent to plead with achilles for the return of hectors body so that he can be buried
achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral , lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th ( in the tradition of niobes offspring )
the poem ends with a description of hectors funeral , with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come
the aethiopis ( 7th century bc ) and a work named posthomerica , composed by quintus of smyrna in the fourth century ce , relate further events from the trojan war
when penthesilea , queen of the amazons and daughter of ares , arrives in troy , priam hopes that she will defeat achilles
after his temporary truce with priam , achilles fights and kills the warrior queen , only to grieve over her death later
at first , he was so distracted by her beauty , he did not fight as intensely as usual
once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life , he refocused and killed her
following the death of patroclus , nestors son antilochus becomes achilles closest companion
when memnon , son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia , slays antilochus , achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield , killing memnon
consequently , eos will not let the sun rise until zeus persuades her
the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus , except that memnon ( unlike hector ) was also the son of a goddess
many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliads description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it
the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis , which was composed after the iliad , possibly in the 7th century bc
the aethiopis is now lost , except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors
the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times
in the iliad , it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship
homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus had sexual relations
although there is no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers , this theory was expressed by some later authors
commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures
in 5th - century bce athens , the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia
in platos symposium , the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple ; phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover
however , ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual , and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women
many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to achilles and patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship
the death of achilles , even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources , is a complex one , with many different versions
in the oldest version , the iliad , and as predicted by hector with his dying breath , the heros death was brought about by paris with an arrow ( to the heel according to statius )
in some versions , the god apollo guided paris arrow
some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow
all of these versions deny paris any sort of valour , owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was , and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield
after death , achilles bones were mingled with those of patroclus , and funeral games were held
he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube
another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses , polyxena
achilles asks priam for polyxenas hand in marriage
priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the worlds greatest warrior
but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles , paris , who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister , hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow , killing him
in the odyssey , agamemnon informs achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in hades
he claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean
achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus
paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles
in book 11 of homers odyssey , odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades
one of these is achilles , who when greeted as blessed in life , blessed in death , responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead
but achilles then asks odysseus of his sons exploits in the trojan war , and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus heroic actions , achilles is filled with satisfaction
this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life
according to some accounts , he had married medea in life , so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades– as hera promised thetis in apollonius argonautica ( 3rd century bc )
achilles armour was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ( ajax the greater )
they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners , who , after considering both mens presentations , decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour
furious , ajax cursed odysseus , which earned him the ire of athena , who temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep , thinking them his comrades
after a while , when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep , he was so ashamed that he committed suicide
odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus , the son of achilles
when odysseus encounters the shade of ajax much later in the house of hades ( odyssey 11–566 ) , ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to odysseus
a relic claimed to be achilles bronze - headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis , lycia , a port on the pamphylian gulf
the city was visited in 333 bce by alexander the great , who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him , but his court biographers do not mention the spear ; however , it was shown in the time of pausanias in the 2nd century ce
numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions
at some point in the war , achilles and ajax were playing a board game ( petteia )
they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle
the trojans attacked and reached the heroes , who were saved only by an intervention of athena
the tomb of achilles , extant throughout antiquity in troad , herodotus , histories 5 ; pliny , naturalis historia 5 ; strabo , geographica 13
32 ( c596 ) ; diogenes laërtius 1
was venerated by thessalians , but also by persian expeditionary forces , as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla
achilles cult was also to be found at other places , e
on the island of astypalaea in the sporades , in sparta which had a sanctuary , in elis and in achilles homeland thessaly , as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum , locri and croton , accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero
the cult of achilles is illustrated in the 500 bce polyxena sarcophagus , which depicts the sacrifice of polyxena near the tumulus of achilles
the spread and intensity of the heros veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus , todays black sea , appears to have been remarkable
an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea , today identified with snake island ( ukrainian зміїний , zmiinyi , near kiliya , ukraine )
early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea ( graffiti and inscribed clay disks , these possibly being votive offerings , from olbia , the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese from the sixth century bc onwards
the cult was still thriving in the third century ce , when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pontárchēs ( ποντάρχης , roughly lord of the sea , or of the pontus euxinus ) , who was invoked as a protector of the city of olbia , venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates , hermes agoraeus , or poseidon
pliny the elder ( 23–79 ad ) in his natural history mentions a port of the achæi and an island of achilles , famous for the tomb of that man , situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieper - bug estuary ; furthermore , at 125roman miles from this island , he places a peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of a sword obliquely , called dromos achilleos ( ἀχιλλέως δρόμος , achilléōs drómos the race - course of achilles ) and considered the place of the heros exercise or of games instituted by him
this last feature of plinys account is considered to be the iconic spit , called today tendra ( or kosa tendra and kosa djarilgatch ) , situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay , but which is hardly 125roman miles ( c
185km ) away from the dnieper - bug estuary , as pliny states
( to the race - course he gives a length of 80miles , c
120km , whereas the spit measures c
in the following chapter of his book , pliny refers to the same island as achillea and introduces two further names for it leuce or macaron ( from greek νῆσος μακαρῶν island of the blest )
the present day measures , he gives at this point , seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with todays snake island
plinys contemporary pomponius mela ( c
43 ad ) tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea , situated between the borysthenes and the ister , adding to the geographical confusion
ruins of a square temple , measuring 30 meters to a side , possibly that dedicated to achilles , were discovered by captain kritzikly in 1823 on snake island
a second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple
a fifth century bc black - glazed lekythos inscription , found on the island in 1840 , reads glaukos , son of poseidon , dedicated me to achilles , lord of leuke
in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc , a statue is dedicated to achilles , lord of leuke , by a citizen of olbia , while in a further dedication , the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the islands cult , again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra - regional hero veneration
the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which , after his untimely death , thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical ( leúkē nêsos white island )
already in the fifth century bc , pindar had mentioned a cult of achilles on a bright island ( φαεννά νᾶσος , phaenná nâsos ) of the black sea , while in another of his works , pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus
well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles ( μακαρῶν νῆσοι , makárôn nêsoi ) or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world , which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it
guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by alcaeus , speaking of achilles lord of scythia and the opposition of north and south , as evoked by achilles fight against the aethiopian prince memnon , who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death
the greek geographer dionysius periegetes , who likely lived during the first century ce , wrote that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white
it is said that there , in leuce island , reside the souls of achilles and other heroes , and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island ; this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues , because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour
similarly , others relate the islands name to its white cliffs , snakes or birds dwelling there
pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals , some wild , some tame
in this island there is also achilles temple and his statue
leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing
pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound
ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters ( aquae ) on the island
a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles
herodotus , pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of a town achílleion ( ἀχίλλειον ) , built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc , close to the heros presumed burial mound in the troad
later attestations point to an achílleion in messenia ( according to stephanus byzantinus ) and an achílleios ( ἀχίλλειος ) in laconia
nicolae densuşianu recognized a connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta , called chilia ( presumably from an older achileii ) , though his conclusion , that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea , evokes modern rather than archaic sea - law

the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son , neoptolemus
alexander the great , son of the epirote princess olympias , could therefore also claim this descent , and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor
he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy
in ad 216 the roman emperor caracalla , while on his way to war against parthia , emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulus
the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles , given the title achilleis by modern scholars
the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war , including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel
extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play
the first part of the achilleis trilogy , the myrmidons , focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus , who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon ; only a few lines survive today
in platos symposium , phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved ; phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles , being the younger and more beautiful of the two , was the beloved , who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him
the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles , a play with achilles as the main character
only a few fragments survive
towards the end of the 5th century bce , a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama ; euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in hecuba , electra , and iphigenia in aulis
the philosopher zeno of elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swift - footed achilles and a tortoise , by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start , and therefore that motion and change were impossible
as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school , zeno believed time and motion to be illusions
in hippias minor , a dialogue attributed to plato , an arrogant man named hippias argues with socrates
the two get into a discussion about lying
they decide that a person who is intentionally false must be better than a person who is unintentionally false , on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying
socrates uses various analogies , discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point
the two also reference homer extensively
socrates and hippias agree that odysseus , who concocted a number of lies throughout the odyssey and other stories in the trojan war cycle , was false intentionally
achilles , like odysseus , told numerous falsehoods
hippias believes that achilles was a generally honest man , while socrates believes that achilles lied for his own benefit
the two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident
socrates eventually abandons homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally
the romans , who traditionally traced their lineage to troy , took a highly negative view of achilles
virgil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men , while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children
other writers , such as catullus , propertius , and ovid , represent a second strand of disparagement , with an emphasis on achilles erotic career
this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in benoît de sainte - maures roman de troie and guido delle colonnes historia destructionis troiae , which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the 17th century
achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon , not as hellene , but as scythian , while according to the byzantine author john malalas , his army was made up of a tribe previously known as myrmidons and later as bulgars

abraham lincoln ( ; february 12 , 1809– april 15 , 1865 ) was an american lawyer and statesman who served as the 16th president of the united states from 1861 until his assassination in 1865
lincoln led the nation through the american civil war and succeeded in preserving the union , abolishing slavery , bolstering the federal government , and modernizing the economy
lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in kentucky and was raised on the frontier , primarily in indiana
he was self - educated and became a lawyer , whig party leader , illinois state legislator , and congressman from illinois
in 1849 , he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the kansas–nebraska act of 1854
he reentered politics in 1854 , becoming a leader in the new republican party , and he reached a national audience in the 1858 senate campaign debates against stephen douglas
lincoln ran for president in 1860 , sweeping the north to gain victory
pro - slavery elements in the south viewed his election as a threat to slavery , and southern states began seceding from the union
during this time the newly formed confederate states of america began seizing federal military bases in the south
just over one month after lincoln assumed the presidency , the confederate states attacked fort sumter , a fort in south carolina
following the bombardment , lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union
lincoln , a moderate republican , had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the democratic and republican parties
his allies , the war democrats and the radical republicans , demanded harsh treatment of the southern confederates
anti - war democrats ( called copperheads ) despised lincoln , and irreconcilable pro - confederate elements plotted his assassination
he managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity , carefully distributing political patronage , and by appealing to the american people
his gettysburg address appealed to nationalistic , republican , egalitarian , libertarian , and democratic sentiments
lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort , including the selection of generals , and implemented a naval blockade of the souths trade
he suspended habeas corpus in maryland , and he averted british intervention by defusing the trent affair
in 1863 he issued the emancipation proclamation , which declared the slaves in the states in rebellion to be free
it also directed the army and navy to recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons and to receive them into the armed service of the united states
lincoln also pressured border states to outlaw slavery , and he promoted the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution , which upon its ratification abolished slavery
lincoln managed his own successful re - election campaign
he sought to heal the war - torn nation through reconciliation
on april 14 , 1865 , just days after the wars end at appomattox , he was attending a play at fords theatre in washington , , with his wife mary when he was fatally shot by confederate sympathizer john wilkes booth
abraham lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the union and abolish slavery
lincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in american history
abraham lincoln was born on february 12 , 1809 , the second child of thomas lincoln and nancy hanks lincoln , in a log cabin on sinking spring farm near hodgenville , kentucky
lincolns paternal grandparents , his namesake captain abraham lincoln and wife bathsheba ( née herring ) moved the family from virginia to jefferson county , kentucky
the captain was killed in an indian raid in 1786
thomas then worked at odd jobs in kentucky and tennessee before the family settled in hardin county , kentucky , in the early 1800s
the heritage of lincolns mother nancy remains unclear , but it is widely assumed that she was the daughter of lucy hanks
they had three children sarah , abraham , and thomas , who died as an infant
thomas lincoln bought or leased farms in kentucky before losing all but in 1816 , the family moved to indiana where the land surveys and titles were more reliable
in hurricane township , perry county , indiana
on october 5 , 1818 , nancy lincoln succumbed to milk sickness , leaving 11 - year - old sarah in charge of a household including her father , 9 - year - old abraham , and nancys 19 - year - old orphan cousin , dennis hanks
on december 2 , 1819 , thomas married sarah bush johnston , a widow from elizabethtown , kentucky , with three children of her own
lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life
his family even said he was lazy , for all his reading , scribbling , writing , ciphering , writing poetry , etcetera
lincoln was largely self - educated
and in indiana , where he went to school sporadically due to farm chores , for a total of less than 12 months in aggregate by the age of 15
family , neighbors , and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the king james bible , aesops fables , john bunyans the pilgrims progress , daniel defoes robinson crusoe , and the autobiography of benjamin franklin
as a teen , lincoln took responsibility for chores and customarily gave his father all earnings from work outside the home until he was 21
he was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough catch - as - catch - can style ( also known as catch wrestling )
he became county wrestling champion at the age of 21
in march 1830 , fearing another milk sickness outbreak , several members of the extended lincoln family , including abraham , moved west to illinois , a free state , and settled in macon county
in 1831 , as thomas and other family prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county , illinois , abraham struck out on his own
lincoln and some friends took goods by flatboat to new orleans , louisiana , where he was first exposed to slavery
in 1865 , lincoln was asked how he came to acquire his rhetorical skills
he answered that in the practice of law he frequently came across the word demonstrate but had insufficient understanding of the term
so , he left springfield for his fathers home to study until he could give any proposition in the six books of euclid here , referencing euclids elements at sight
lincolns first romantic interest was ann rutledge , whom he met when he moved to new salem
by 1835 , they were in a relationship but not formally engaged
in the early 1830s , he met mary owens from kentucky
late in 1836 , lincoln agreed to a match with owens if she returned to new salem
owens arrived that november and he courted her for a time ; however , they both had second thoughts
on august 16 , 1837 , he wrote owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship , and she never replied
in 1839 , lincoln met mary todd in springfield , illinois , and the following year they became engaged
a wedding set for january 1 , 1841 , was canceled at lincolns request , but they reconciled and married on november 4 , 1842 , in the springfield mansion of marys sister
in 1844 , the couple bought a house in springfield near his law office
mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative
lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons , though his work regularly kept him away from home
the oldest , robert todd lincoln , was born in 1843 and was the only child to live to maturity
edward baker lincoln ( eddie ) , born in 1846 , died february 1 , 1850 , probably of tuberculosis
lincolns third son , willie lincoln was born on december 21 , 1850 , and died of a fever at the white house on february 20 , 1862
the youngest , thomas tad lincoln , was born on april 4 , 1853 , and survived his father but died of heart failure at age 18 on july 16 , 1871
year2012publishersiu presspage420isbn978 - 0 - 8093 - 3055 - 3access - datejune 27 , 2015 lincoln was remarkably fond of children in fact , lincolns law partner william herndon would grow irritated when lincoln would bring his children to the law office
their father , it seemed , was often too absorbed in his work to notice his childrens behavior
herndon recounted , i have felt many and many a time that i wanted to wring their little necks , and yet out of respect for lincoln i kept my mouth shut
lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done
the deaths of their sons , eddie and willie , had profound effects on both parents
lincoln suffered from melancholy , a condition now thought to be clinical depression
when lincoln returned home from the black hawk war , he planned to become a blacksmith
he didnt , but he formed a partnership with william berry , 21 , with whom he purchased a general store on credit in new salem , illinois
because a license was required to sell customers single beverages , berry obtained bartending licenses for 7 each for lincoln and himself , and in 1833 the store became a tavern as well
as licensed bartenders , lincoln and berry were able to sell spirits , including liquor , for 12 cents a pint
they offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food , including takeout dinners
but berry became an alcoholic , was often too drunk to work , and lincoln ended up running the store by himself
lincoln briefly interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war
lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates ( the top four were elected ) , though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the new salem precinct
lincoln served as new salems postmaster and later as county surveyor , but continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer
lincolns second state house campaign in 1834 , this time as a whig , was a success over a powerful whig opponent
he championed construction of the illinois and michigan canal , and later was a canal commissioner
in 1837 , he declared , the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy , but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils
he was admitted to the illinois bar in 1836 , lincoln emerged as a formidable trial combatant during cross - examinations and closing arguments
he partnered several years with stephen logan , and in 1844 began his practice with william herndon , a studious young man
true to his record , lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be an old line whig , a disciple of henry clay
in 1843 , lincoln sought the whig nomination for illinois 7th district seat in the house of representatives ; he was defeated by john hardin though he prevailed with the party in limiting hardin to one term
lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in 1846 but also won the election
he was the only whig in the illinois delegation , but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line
lincoln teamed with joshua giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners , enforcement to capture fugitive slaves , and a popular vote on the matter
he dropped the bill when it eluded whig support
on foreign and military policy , lincoln spoke against the mexican–american war , which he imputed to president james polks desire for military glory—that attractive rainbow , that rises in showers of blood
lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions
the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico , and polk insisted that mexican soldiers had invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow - citizens on our own soil
the resolution was ignored in both congress and the national papers , and it cost lincoln political support in his district
one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him spotty lincoln
lincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the house
realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency , he supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election
the administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the oregon territory as consolation
this distant territory was a democratic stronghold , and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in illinois , so he declined and resumed his law practice
in his springfield practice , lincoln handled every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer
lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nations western expansion , particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges
as a riverboat man , lincoln initially favored those interests , but ultimately represented whoever hired him

lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases ; he was sole counsel in 51 cases , of which 31 were decided in his favor
his legal reputation gave rise to the nickname honest abe
lincoln argued in an 1858 criminal trial , defending william duff armstrong , who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker
leading up to his presidential campaign , lincoln elevated his profile in an 1859 murder case , with his defense of simeon quinn peachy harrison who was a third cousin ; harrison was also the grandson of lincolns political opponent , rev
peter cartwright
lincoln angrily protested the judges initial decision to exclude cartwrights testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay
lincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule
instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as expected , the judge , a democrat , reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence , resulting in harrisons acquittal
the debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave - holding south and the free north , with the failure of the compromise of 1850 , a legislative package designed to address the issue
as the slavery debate in the nebraska and kansas territories became particularly acrimonious , illinois senator stephen douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise ; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery
the legislation alarmed many northerners , who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result , but douglass kansas–nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may 1854
lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his peoria speech of october 1854
lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery , which he repeated en route to the presidency
lincolns attacks on the kansas–nebraska act marked his return to political life
nationally , the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas–nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue
reflecting on the demise of his party , lincoln wrote in 1855 , i think i am a whig , but others say there are no whigs , and that i am an abolitionist
i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery
lincoln resisted early republican entreaties , fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists
in 1854 , lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat
the years elections showed the strong opposition to the kansas–nebraska act , and in the aftermath , lincoln sought election to the united states senate
after leading in the first six rounds of voting , he was unable to obtain a majority
lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull
trumbull was an antislavery democrat , and had received few votes in the earlier ballots ; his supporters , also antislavery democrats , had vowed not to support any whig
lincolns decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbulls antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate , joel aldrich matteson
violent political confrontations in kansas continued , and opposition to the kansas–nebraska act remained strong throughout the north
as the 1856 elections approached , lincoln joined the republicans and attended the bloomington convention , which formally established the illinois republican party
the convention platform endorsed congresss right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of kansas as a free state
lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the union
buchanan prevailed , while republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois , and lincoln became a leading republican in illinois
dred scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a free territory under the missouri compromise
after scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom
his petition was denied in dred scott v
sandford ( 1857 )
supreme court chief justice roger taney in the decision wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution
while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories , the decision sparked further outrage in the north
he argued the decision was at variance with the declaration of independence ; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect , they believed all men were equal in certain inalienable rights , among which are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness
in 1858 , douglas was up for re - election in the senate , and lincoln hoped to defeat him
many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in 1858 , and lincolns 1856 campaigning and support of trumbull had earned him a favor
many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference
for the first time , illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate , and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition
lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal
after his nomination he delivered his house divided speech , with the biblical reference mark 325 , a house divided against itself cannot stand
i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free
i do not expect the union to be dissolved—i do not expect the house to fall—but i do expect it will cease to be divided
it will become all one thing , or all the other
the stage was then set for the election of the illinois legislature which would , in turn , select lincoln or douglas
the senate campaign featured seven debates between lincoln and douglas
these were the most famous political debates in american history ; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands
lincolns argument assumed a moral tone , as he claimed douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery
douglass argument was more legal , claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the supreme court in the dred scott decision
though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes , the democrats won more seats , and the legislature re - elected douglas
lincolns articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence
in the aftermath of the 1858 election , newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate , rivaled by william seward , salmon chase , edward bates , and simon cameron
while lincoln was popular in the midwest , he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure whether to seek office
over the coming months , lincoln was tireless , making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail
by the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric , he quickly became the champion of the republican party
however , despite his overwhelming support in the midwestern united states , he was less appreciated in the east
horace greeley , editor of the new york tribune , at that time wrote up an unflattering account of lincolns compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the courts dred - scott ruling , which was promptly used against him by his political rivals
on february 27 , 1860 , powerful new york republicans invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union , in which he argued that the founding fathers of the united states had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery
he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery , and rejected any groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong
but lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention
journalist noah brooks reported , no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience
historian david herbert donald described the speech as a superb political move for an unannounced candidate , to appear in one rivals ( seward ) own state at an event sponsored by the second rivals ( chase ) loyalists , while not mentioning either by name during its delivery
on may 9–10 , 1860 , the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur
exploiting his embellished frontier legend ( clearing land and splitting fence rails ) , lincolns supporters adopted the label of the rail candidate
michael martinez wrote about the effective imaging of lincoln by his campaign
at times he was presented as the plain - talking rail splitter and at other times he was honest abe , unpolished but trustworthy
on may 18 , at the republican national convention in chicago , lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot , beating candidates such as seward and chase
a former democrat , hannibal hamlin of maine , was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket
lincolns success depended on his campaign team , his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue , and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff
pennsylvania put him over the top , led by the states iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support
as the slave power tightened its grip on the national government , most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party
throughout the 1850s , lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war , and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession
a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee
lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north , while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south
prior to the republican convention , the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization , the wide awakes , which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives , thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties
people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln

as douglas and the other candidates campaigned , lincoln gave no speeches , relying on the enthusiasm of the republican party
the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters , leaflets , and newspaper editorials
republican speakers focused first on the party platform , and second on lincolns life story , emphasizing his childhood poverty
the goal was to demonstrate the power of free labor , which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts
though he did not give public appearances , many sought to visit him and write him
in the runup to the election , he took an office in the illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention
he also hired john george nicolay as his personal secretary , who would remain in that role during the presidency
on november 6 , 1860 , lincoln was elected the 16th president
he was the first republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west
no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 southern slave states , and he won only two of 996 counties in all the southern states , an omen of the impending civil war
lincoln received 1 , 866 , 452 votes , or 39 of the total in a four - way race , carrying the free northern states , as well as california and oregon
the south was outraged by lincolns election , and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the union before he took office in march 1861
six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation , the confederate states of america , and adopted a constitution
president buchanan and president - elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy , declaring secession illegal
attempts at compromise followed but lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the partys platform of free - soil in the territories
lincoln tacitly supported the corwin amendment to the constitution , which passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when lincoln took office
that doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed
en route to his inauguration , lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north
lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south , proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states
lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between north and south , stating one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended , while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended
this is the only substantial dispute
the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies , but friends
we must not be enemies the mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battlefield , and patriot grave , to every living heart and hearthstone , all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the union , when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature
in his second inaugural address , lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said both parties deprecated war , but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive , and the other would accept war rather than let it perish , and the war came
major robert anderson , commander of the unions fort sumter in charleston , south carolina , sent a request for provisions to washington , and lincolns order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war
on april 12 , 1861 , confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight
historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis , exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south , and overlooking southern unionist opposition to an invasion
william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war
on april 15 , lincoln called on the states to send a total of 75 , 000 volunteer troops to recapture forts , protect washington , and preserve the union , which , in his view , remained intact despite the seceding states
this call forced states to choose sides
virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of richmond as the confederate capital , despite its exposure to union lines
north carolina , tennessee , and arkansas followed over the following two months
secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland , but did not prevail ; kentucky remained neutral
the fort sumter attack rallied americans north of the mason - dixon line to defend the nation
as states sent union regiments south , on april 19 , baltimore mobs in control of the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains
local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the army responded by arresting local maryland officials
lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus where needed for the security of troops trying to reach washington
lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the union military strategy
he responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander - in - chief by exercising unprecedented authority
he expanded his war powers , imposed a blockade on confederate ports , disbursed funds before appropriation by congress , suspended habeas corpus , and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers
lincoln gained the support of congress and the northern public for these actions
lincoln also had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict
it was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success , and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle , such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions
copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery
the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery
in august 1861 , general john frémont , the 1856 republican presidential nominee , without consulting washington , issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels
lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity
internationally , lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the confederacy
in the 1861 trent affair which threatened war with great britain , the navy illegally intercepted a british mail ship , the trent , on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys ; britain protested vehemently while the cheered
lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats
biographer james randall dissected lincolns successful techniques
lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the war department
he tracked all phases of the effort , consulting with governors , and selecting generals based on their success , their state , and their party
in january 1862 , after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department , lincoln replaced war secretary simon cameron with edwin stanton
stanton centralized the war departments activities , auditing and canceling contracts , saving the federal government 17 , 000 , 000

lincolns war strategy embraced two priorities ensuring that washington was well - defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt , decisive victory
twice a week , lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon
occasionally mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride , concerned that he was working too hard
lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army , rather than simply capturing territory
after the union rout at bull run and winfield scotts retirement , lincoln appointed major general george mcclellan general - in - chief
in 1862 , lincoln removed mcclellan for the generals continued inaction
he elevated henry halleck in july and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia
but pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 , forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington
despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellans failure to reinforce pope , lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington
that battle , a union victory , was among the bloodiest in american history ; it facilitated lincolns emancipation proclamation in january
mcclellan then resisted the presidents demand that he pursue lees withdrawing army , while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee
lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans ; and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside
the appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on lincolns part
burnside , against presidential advice , launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december
desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after fredericksburg , so lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker
in the 1862 midterm elections the republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation , high taxes , rumors of corruption , suspension of habeas corpus , military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market
the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest , but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest , where many southerners had lived for generations
in the spring of 1863 lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near ; the plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond , rosecrans on chattanooga , grant on vicksburg , and a naval assault on charleston
hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may , then resigned and was replaced by george meade

the federal governments power to end slavery was limited by the constitution , which before 1865 delegated the issue to the individual states
lincoln argued that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented
he sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves in return for their acceptance of abolition
in june 1862 , congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory , which lincoln signed
in july , the confiscation act of 1862 was enacted , providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion ; lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional
he felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander - in - chief , which he planned to exercise
lincoln at this time reviewed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet
privately , lincoln concluded that the confederacys slave base had to be eliminated
copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification ; republican editor horace greeley of the new york tribune agreed
on september 22 , 1862 , lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation , freeing the slaves in 10 states not then under union control ,
with the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective , union armies advancing south liberated three million slaves
enlisting former slaves became official policy
by the spring of 1863 , lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers
in a letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops , lincoln wrote , the bare sight of 50 , 000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once
defying his prediction that the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here , the address became the most quoted speech in american history

general ulysses grants victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln
responding to criticism of grant after shiloh , lincoln had said , i cant spare this man
he fights
lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864
he arranged for an intermediary to inquire into grants political intentions , and once assured that he had none , lincoln promoted grant to the newly revived rank of lieutenant general , a rank which had been unoccupied since george washington
grant in 1864 waged the bloody overland campaign , which exacted heavy losses on both sides
grants army moved steadily south
lincoln traveled to grants headquarters at city point , virginia , to confer with grant and william tecumseh sherman
lincoln authorized grant to target infrastructure—plantations , railroads , and bridges—hoping to weaken the souths morale and fighting ability
he emphasized defeat of the confederate armies over destruction ( which was considerable ) for its own sake
as grant continued to weaken lees forces , efforts to discuss peace began
confederate vice president stephens led a group meeting with lincoln , seward , and others at hampton roads
lincoln refused to negotiate with the confederacy as a coequal ; his objective to end the fighting was not realized
lincoln ran for reelection in 1864 , while uniting the main republican factions , along with war democrats edwin stanton and andrew johnson
lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the radicals efforts to replace him
grants bloody stalemates damaged lincolns re - election prospects , and many republicans feared defeat
lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election , he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house ;
the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure ; but their candidate , mcclellan , supported the war and repudiated the platform
meanwhile , lincoln emboldened grant with more troops and republican party support
shermans capture of atlanta in september and david farraguts capture of mobile ended defeatism
on november 8 , lincoln carried all but three states , including 78 percent of union soldiers
on march 4 , 1865 , lincoln delivered his second inaugural address
in it , he deemed the war casualties to be gods will
historian mark noll places the speech among the small handful of semi - sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world ; it is inscribed in the lincoln memorial
lincoln said
reconstruction preceded the wars end , as lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation , and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves
when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates were to be treated , lincoln replied , let em up easy
lincoln led the moderates in reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radicals , under rep
thaddeus stevens , sen
charles sumner and sen
benjamin wade , who otherwise remained lincolns allies
determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the south , lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held
his amnesty proclamation of december 8 , 1863 , offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office and had not mistreated union prisoners , if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance
as southern states fell , they needed leaders while their administrations were restored
in tennessee and arkansas , lincoln respectively appointed johnson and frederick steele as military governors
in louisiana , lincoln ordered general nathaniel banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed , and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery
democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations
the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient , and passed their own plan , the 1864 wade–davis bill , which lincoln vetoed
the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana , arkansas , and tennessee
lincolns appointments were designed to harness both moderates and radicals
to fill chief justice taneys seat on the supreme court , he named the radicals choice , salmon chase , who lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies
after implementing the emancipation proclamation , lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment
he declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter and by december 1863 an amendment was brought to congress
with ratification , it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6 , 1865
lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen
he signed senator charles sumners freedmens bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves
the law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen
lincoln announced a reconstruction plan that involved short - term military control , pending readmission under the control of southern unionists
historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly how reconstruction would have proceeded had lincoln lived
biographers james randall and richard current , according to david lincove , argue that
lincolns experience with indians followed the death of his grandfather abraham by indian assailants , in the presence of his father and uncles
lincoln was a veteran of the black hawk war , which was fought in wisconsin and illinois in 1832
he volunteered with the goal of expelling indians from illinois , but he saw no combat
during his presidency , lincolns policy toward indians was driven by politics
he used the indian bureau as a source of patronage , making appointments to his loyal followers in minnesota and wisconsin
he faced difficulties guarding western settlers , railroads , and telegraphs , from indian attacks
on august 17 , 1862 , the dakota uprising in minnesota , supported by the yankton indians , killed hundreds of white settlers , forced 30 , 000 from their homes , and deeply alarmed washington
lincoln sent general john pope to minnesota as commander of the new department of the northwest
when the confederates protested forcing confederate prisoners to fight indians , lincoln revoked the policy
aiding pope , minnesota congressman col
henry sibley led militiamen and regular troops to defeat the dakota at wood lake
an unusual military court was set up to prosecute captured natives , with lincoln effectively acting as the route of appeal
lincoln personally reviewed each of 303 execution warrants for santee dakota convicted of killing innocent farmers ; he commuted the sentences of all but 39 ( one was later reprieved )
lincoln adhered to the whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to congress responsibility for legislating
lincoln vetoed only four bills , including the wade - davis bill with its harsh reconstruction program
the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was enabled by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s
in the selection and use of his cabinet , lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency
lincoln commented on his thought process , we need the strongest men of the party in the cabinet
we needed to hold our own people together
i had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men
then i had no right to deprive the country of their services
there were two measures passed to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs ( a policy with long precedent ) , and a federal income tax
in 1861 , lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariffs , following the first enacted by buchanan
he also signed the revenue act of 1861 , creating the first income tax—a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above 800 ( in current dollar terms )
the lincoln administration presided over the expansion of the federal governments economic influence in other areas
the national banking act created the system of national banks
the us issued paper currency for the first time , known as greenbacks—printed in green on the reverse side
in response to rumors of a renewed draft , the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market
lincoln attacked the media for such behavior , and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days
in june 1864 , lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress , which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park
lincolns philosophy on court nominations was that we cannot ask a man what he will do , and if we should , and he should answer us , we should despise him for it
therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known
lincoln named his main political rival william seward as secretary of state , and left most diplomatic issues in his portfolio
however lincoln did select some of the top diplomats as part of his patronage policy
he also closely watched the handling of the trent affair in late 1861 to make sure there was no escalation into a war with britain
sewards main role was to keep britain and france from supporting the confederacy
he was successful after indicating to london and paris that washington would declare war on them if they supported richmond
john wilkes booth was a well - known actor and a confederate spy from maryland ; though he never joined the confederate army , he had contacts with the confederate secret service
when booth learned of the lincolns intent to attend a play with general grant , he planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at fords theatre
lincoln and his wife attended the play our american cousin on the evening of april 14 , just five days after the union victory at the battle of appomattox courthouse
at the last minute , grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play
on april 14 , 1865 , hours before he was assassinated , lincoln signed legislation establishing the united states secret service ,
two weeks later , booth , refusing to surrender , was tracked to a farm in virginia , and was mortally shot by sergeant boston corbett and died on april 26
secretary of war stanton had issued orders that booth be taken alive , so corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed
after a brief interview , stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge
the late president lay in state , first in the east room of the white house , and then in the capitol rotunda from april 19 through april 21
the caskets containing lincolns body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the lincoln special funeral train
or in silent grief
poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd to eulogize him , one of four poems he wrote about lincoln
as a young man , lincoln was a religious skeptic
he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others
his three most famous speeches—the house divided speech , the gettysburg address , and his second inaugural—each contain direct allusions to providence and quotes from scripture
in the 1840s , lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity , a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power
he never joined a church , although he frequently attended first presbyterian church with his wife beginning in 1852
in the 1850s , lincoln asserted his belief in providence in a general way , and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals ; he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence
the death of son willie in february 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace
lincoln did believe in an all - powerful god that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches
this spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address , considered by some scholars lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences , who were mostly evangelical protestants
lincoln is believed to have had depression , smallpox , and malaria
to treat constipation
it is unknown to what extent he may have suffered from mercury poisoning
several claims have been made that lincolns health was declining before the assassination
these are often based on photographs of lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting
it is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b
lincolns redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as john patrick diggins , harry jaffa , vernon burton , eric foner , and herman belz
diggins notes , lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself in the 1860 cooper union speech
his position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially a contract among the states , and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract
furthermore , it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state

as a whig activist , lincoln was a spokesman for business interests , favoring high tariffs , banks , infrastructure improvements , and railroads , in opposition to jacksonian democrats
nevertheless , lincoln admired andrew jacksons steeliness as well as his patriotism
william harris found that lincolns reverence for the founding fathers , the constitution , the laws under it , and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism
in lincolns first inaugural address , he explored the nature of democracy
he denounced secession as anarchy , and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints
he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations , and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments , is the only true sovereign of a free people
the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country
the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural ( these united states ) and other times in the singular
the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century
in surveys of scholars ranking presidents conducted since 1948 , the top three presidents are lincoln , washington , and franklin delano roosevelt , although the order varies
a 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one , while legal scholars placed him second after george washington
lincolns assassination left him a national martyr
he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty
republicans linked lincolns name to their party
many , though not all , in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability

schwartz argues that lincolns american reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the progressive era ( 1900–1920s ) , when he emerged as one of americas most venerated heroes , even among white southerners
the high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington ,
union nationalism , as envisioned by lincoln , helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt , woodrow wilson , and franklin delano roosevelt
sociologist barry schwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life
during the great depression , he argues , lincoln served as a means for seeing the worlds disappointments , for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful
franklin roosevelt , preparing america for war , used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan
americans asked , what would lincoln do
in the cold war years , lincolns image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes
he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks
bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country
the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery , or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them
and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause , as fast as politically possible
by the 1970s , lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives—apart from neo - confederates such as mel bradford , who denounced his treatment of the white south—for his intense nationalism , his support for business , his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery , his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition , and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers

historian barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincolns image suffered erosion , fading prestige , benign ridicule in the late 20th century
in the 21st century , president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the lincoln bible for his inaugural ceremonies
lincolns portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency , the penny and the 5 bill
his likeness also appears on many postage stamps
while he is usually portrayed bearded , he did not grow a beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11 - year - old grace bedell
he was the first of five presidents to do so
he has been memorialized in many town , city , and county names , the united states navy is named after lincoln , the second navy ship to bear his name
the lincoln memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nations capital , fords theatre , among the top sites in washington , , is across the street from petersen house ( where he died )
a portrait carving of lincoln appears with those of three other presidents on mount rushmore , which receives about 3million visitors a year

aristotle ( ; 384–322bc ) was a greek philosopher and polymath during the classical period in ancient greece
taught by plato , he was the founder of the lyceum , the peripatetic school of philosophy , and the aristotelian tradition
his writings cover many subjects including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theatre , music , rhetoric , psychology , linguistics , economics , politics , meteorology , geology , and government
aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him
it was above all from his teachings that the west inherited its intellectual lexicon , as well as problems and methods of inquiry
as a result , his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the west and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion
little is known about his life
aristotle was born in the city of stagira in northern greece
his father , nicomachus , died when aristotle was a child , and he was brought up by a guardian
at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined platos academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty - seven ( c
he established a library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls
though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication , only around a third of his original output has survived , none of it intended for publication
aristotles views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship
the influence of physical science extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed
some of aristotles zoological observations found in his biology , such as on the hectocotyl ( reproductive ) arm of the octopus , were disbelieved until the 19th century
he also influenced judeo - islamic philosophies ( 800–1400 ) during the middle ages , as well as christian theology , especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church
aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as the first teacher , and among medieval christians like thomas aquinas as simply the philosopher , while the poet dante called him “the master of those who know
his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , and were studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan
aristotles influence on logic continued well into the 19th century
in addition , his ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics
aristotle has been called the father of logic , the father of biology , the father of political science , the father of zoology , the father of embryology , the father of natural law , the father of scientific method , the father of rhetoric , the father of psychology , the father of realism , the father of criticism , the father of individualism , the father of teleology , and the father of meteorology
in general , the details of aristotles life are not well - established
the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points
covers ancient biographies of aristotle
aristotle , whose name means the best purpose in ancient greek , both of aristotles parents died when he was about thirteen , and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian
at the age of seventeen or eighteen , aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at platos academy
aristotle remained in athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348 / 47bc
the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academys direction after control passed to platos nephew speusippus , although it is possible that he feared the anti - macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died
aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon
during aristotles time in the macedonian court , he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy and cassander
by 335bc , aristotle had returned to athens , establishing his own school there known as the lyceum
aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years
while in athens , his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira , who bore him a son whom he named after his father , nicomachus
if the suda is accurate , he may also have had an erômenos , palaephatus of abydus
this period in athens , between 335 and 323 bc , is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works
near the end of his life , alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexanders relationship with persia and persians
a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexanders death , but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death
prompting him to flee to his mothers family estate in chalcis , on euboea , at which occasion he was said to have stated i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy
with the prior analytics , aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic , kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion
what is today called aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism ( methods of logical argument ) , the books are
the order of the books ( or the teachings from which they are composed ) is not certain , but this list was derived from analysis of aristotles writings
it goes from the basics , the analysis of simple terms in the categories , the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation , to the study of more complex forms , namely , syllogisms ( in the analytics ) and dialectics ( in the topics and sophistical refutations )
the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning
the rhetoric is not conventionally included , but it states that it relies on the topics
the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotles works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics
aristotle called it first philosophy , and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science ( physics ) as the contemplative ( theoretikē ) philosophy which is theological and studies the divine
he wrote in his metaphysics ( 1026a16 )
aristotle examines the concepts of substance ( ousia ) and essence ( to ti ên einai , the what it was to be ) in his metaphysics ( book vii ) , and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form , a philosophical theory called hylomorphism
in book viii , he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum , or the stuff of which it is composed
for example , the matter of a house is the bricks , stones , timbers , etcetera , or whatever constitutes the potential house , while the form of the substance is the actual house , namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other differentia that let us define something as a house
the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter , and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form
like his teacher plato , aristotles philosophy aims at the universal
aristotles ontology places the universal ( katholou ) in particulars ( kath hekaston ) , things in the world , whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate
for aristotle , form is still what phenomena are based on , but is instantiated in a particular substance
plato argued that all things have a universal form , which could be either a property or a relation to other things
when one looks at an apple , for example , one sees an apple , and one can also analyse a form of an apple
in this distinction , there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple
moreover , one can place an apple next to a book , so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other
plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things
for example , it is possible that there is no particular good in existence , but good is still a proper universal form
aristotle disagreed with plato on this point , arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time , and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things
in addition , aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals
where plato spoke of the world of forms , a place where all universal forms subsist , aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated
so , according to aristotle , the form of apple exists within each apple , rather than in the world of the forms
with regard to the change ( kinesis ) and its causes now , as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption 319b–320a , he distinguishes the coming to be from
the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property
in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality ( dynamis ) and actuality ( entelecheia ) in association with the matter and the form
referring to potentiality , this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else
for example , the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially ( dynamei ) a plant , and if it is not prevented by something , it will become a plant
potentially beings can either act ( poiein ) or be acted upon ( paschein ) , which can be either innate or learned
for example , the eyes possess the potentiality of sight ( innate – being acted upon ) , while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning ( exercise – acting )
actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality
because the end ( telos ) is the principle of every change , and for the sake of the end exists potentiality , therefore actuality is the end
referring then to the previous example , it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do
in summary , the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities , which is also a final cause or end
then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula , in time and in substantiality
with this definition of the particular substance ( that is , matter and form ) , aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings , for example , what is it that makes a man one since , according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped , how then is man a unity however , according to aristotle , the potential being ( matter ) and the actual one ( form ) are one and the same
aristotles immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world , and rises to knowledge of the universal , whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms ( or ideas ) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these
aristotles natural philosophy spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics , biology and other natural sciences
in his on generation and corruption , aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles , earth , water , air , and fire , to two of the four sensible qualities , hot , cold , wet , and dry
in the empedoclean scheme , all matter was made of the four elements , in differing proportions
aristotles scheme added the heavenly aether , the divine substance of the heavenly spheres , stars and planets
aristotle describes two kinds of motion violent or unnatural motion , such as that of a thrown stone , in the physics ( 254b10 ) , and natural motion , such as of a falling object , in on the heavens ( 300a20 )
in violent motion , as soon as the agent stops causing it , the motion stops also in other words , the natural state of an object is to be at rest , with this understanding , it can be observed that , as aristotle stated , heavy objects ( on the ground , say ) require more force to make them move ; and objects pushed with greater force move faster
natural motion depends on the element concerned the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens , while the 4 empedoclean elements move vertically up ( like fire , as is observed ) or down ( like earth ) towards their natural resting places
in the physics ( 215a25 ) , aristotle effectively states a quantitative law , that the speed , v , of a falling body is proportional ( say , with constant c ) to its weight , w , and inversely proportional to the density , ρ , of the fluid in which it is falling
aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite , and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible
opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws
henri carteron held the extreme view but other authors reject this
archimedes corrected aristotles theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places ; metal boats can float if they displace enough water ; floating depends in archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object , not , as aristotle thought , its elementary composition
aristotles writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period
john philoponus ( in the middle ages ) and galileo are said to have shown by experiment that aristotles claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect
) , and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium
newtons forced motion corresponds to aristotles violent motion with its external agent , but aristotles assumption that the agents effect stops immediately it stops acting ( for example , the ball leaves the throwers hand ) has awkward consequences he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it , resulting in the medieval theory of impetus
aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors
his term aitia is traditionally translated as cause , but it does not always refer to temporal sequence ; it might be better translated as explanation , but the traditional rendering will be employed here
aristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in problems , book 15
the apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in
with it , he saw that whatever shape he made the hole , the suns image always remained circular
he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image
according to aristotle , spontaneity and chance are causes of some things , distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity
chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things , from what is spontaneous
there is also more a specific kind of chance , which aristotle names luck , that only applies to peoples moral choices
in astronomy , aristotle refuted democrituss claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays , pointing out correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun , then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them
aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations
he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one persons lifetime
the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change , including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers , giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer , and the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands , previous to a volcanic eruption
aristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle and meteorology ( including his major writings meteorologica )
for example , he made some of the earliest observations about desalination he observed early – and correctly – that when seawater is heated , freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff ( i have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again
aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically , his data in history of animals , generation of animals , movement of animals , and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations , cite weburlhttps / / www

htmltitledarwins ghosts , by rebecca stott
aristotle reports on the sea - life visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen
he describes the catfish , electric ray , and frogfish in detail , as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus
his description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods , used in sexual reproduction , was widely disbelieved until the 19th century
and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark
he notes that an animals structure is well matched to function , so , among birds , the heron , which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish , has a long neck and long legs , and a sharp spear - like beak , whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet
aristotles writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution , but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur , he saw these as rare accidents
for aristotle , accidents , like heat waves in winter , must be considered distinct from natural causes
he was thus critical of empedocless materialist theory of a survival of the fittest origin of living things and their organs , and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results
aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense
in generation of animals , he finds a fertilized hens egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryos heart beating inside
instead , he practiced a different style of science systematically gathering data , discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals , and inferring possible causal explanations from these
this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field , such as genomics
it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science , but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed
in this sense , aristotles biology is scientific
from the data he collected and documented , aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life - history features of the live - bearing tetrapods ( terrestrial placental mammals ) that he studied
among these correct predictions are the following
brood size decreases with ( adult ) body mass , so that an elephant has fewer young ( usually just one ) per brood than a mouse
lifespan increases with gestation period , and also with body mass , so that elephants live longer than mice , have a longer period of gestation , and are heavier
as a final example , fecundity decreases with lifespan , so long - lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short - lived kinds like mice
aristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals , arranging these in the history of animals in a graded scale of perfection , a nonreligious version of the scala naturae , with man at the top
his system had eleven grades of animal , from highest potential to lowest , expressed in their form at birth the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures , the lowest laid cold , dry mineral - like eggs
animals came above plants , and these in turn were above minerals
he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter animals with blood , and below them the colder invertebrates as animals without blood
those with blood were divided into the live - bearing ( mammals ) , and the egg - laying ( birds , reptiles , fish )
those without blood were insects , crustacea ( non - shelled – cephalopods , and shelled ) and the hard - shelled molluscs ( bivalves and gastropods )
he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale , and noted various exceptions , such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods
to a modern biologist , the explanation , not available to aristotle , is convergent evolution
he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes ; this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design
aristotles psychology , given in his treatise on the soul ( peri psychēs ) , posits three kinds of soul ( psyches ) the vegetative soul , the sensitive soul , and the rational soul
humans have a rational soul
the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself ; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally
the unique part of the human , rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous ( intellect ) and logos ( reason )
for aristotle , the soul is the form of a living being
because all beings are composites of form and matter , the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings , for example the ability to initiate movement ( or in the case of plants , growth and chemical transformations , which aristotle considers types of movement )
notable is aristotles division of sensation and thought , which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers , with the exception of alcmaeon
according to aristotle in on the soul , memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past
aristotle uses the term memory for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation , and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents
memory is of the past , prediction is of the future , and sensation is of the present
retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly
a transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences , both for previous experience and present experience
because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions , people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences
to search for these impressions , people search the memory itself
recollection is thus the self - directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression
aristotle believed the chain of thought , which ends in recollection of certain impressions , was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity , contrast , and contiguity , described in his laws of association
aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind
a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience
according to aristotle , association is the power innate in a mental state , which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences , allowing them to rise and be recalled
aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness
or of digestion , while a person is asleep , the critical activities , which include thinking , sensing , recalling and remembering , do not function as they do during wakefulness
since a person cannot sense during sleep they cannot have desire , which is the result of sensation
however , the senses are able to work during sleep , unless they are weary
dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus
in dreams , sensation is still involved , but in an altered manner
when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly , a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored
so , dreams result from these lasting impressions
since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli , dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience
this leads the person to believe the dream is real , even when the dreams are absurd in nature
one component of aristotles theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs
he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being
aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences
aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study , that is , one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake
he wrote several treatises on ethics , including most notably , the nicomachean ethics
aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ( ergon ) of a thing
an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see , because the proper function of an eye is sight
aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans , and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē ( soul ) in accordance with reason ( logos )
aristotle identified such an optimum activity ( the virtuous mean , between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency
aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately , but by teachers , and experience , leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things
when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom ( phronesis ) and their intellect ( nous ) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue , the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker , or in other words , a philosopher
in addition to his works on ethics , which address the individual , aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics
aristotle considered the city to be a natural community
moreover , he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual , for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part
aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine , and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others
aristotles conception of the city is organic , and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner
the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotles understanding
although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires , the natural community according to aristotle was the city ( polis ) which functions as a political community or partnership ( koinōnia )
the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability , but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life , and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded , therefore , as being for the sake of noble actions , not for the sake of living together
this is distinguished from modern approaches , beginning with social contract theory , according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences
as platos disciple aristotle was rather skeptical concerning democracy and , following platos vague ideas , he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so - called mixed state
to illustrate this approach , aristotle proposed a first - of - its - kind mathematical model of voting , albeit textually described , where the democratic principle of one voter–one vote is combined with the oligarchic merit - weighted voting ; for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see
aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought , especially to thought in the middle ages
aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society , and that although private property is often blamed for social strife , such evils in fact come from human nature
in politics , aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money
aristotles discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the middle ages
he had a low opinion of retail , believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household , retail trade seeks to make a profit
it thus uses goods as a means to an end , rather than as an end unto itself
he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural
similarly , aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural , as it makes a gain out of the money itself , and not from its use
aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time
he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth , the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement
money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them commensurable
aristotles rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience ethos ( an appeal to the speakers character ) , pathos ( an appeal to the audiences emotion ) , and logos ( an appeal to logical reasoning )
aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs enthymeme ( proof by syllogism ) and paradeigma ( proof by example )
aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry , tragedy , comedy , dithyrambic poetry , painting , sculpture , music , and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis ( imitation ) , each varying in imitation by medium , object , and manner
he applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artists intention aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry follows the pattern of nature
for example , music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony , whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone , and poetry with language
the forms also differ in their object of imitation
comedy , for instance , is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average
lastly , the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama
while it is believed that aristotles poetics originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived
aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements plot - structure , character , style , thought , spectacle , and lyric poetry
aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles , folklore , and proverbs ; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop
aristotles analysis of procreation describes an active , ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert , passive female element
on this ground , proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny however , aristotle gave equal weight to womens happiness as he did to mens , and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men
more than 2300 years after his death , aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived
among countless other achievements , aristotle was the founder of formal logic , - - gt ; pioneered the study of zoology , and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method
jonathan barnes wrote that an account of aristotles intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of european thought
aristotles pupil and successor , theophrastus , wrote the history of plants , a pioneering work in botany
some of his technical terms remain in use , such as carpel from carpos , fruit , and pericarp , from pericarpion , seed chamber
theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was , instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned
the immediate influence of aristotles work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school
aristotles notable students included aristoxenus , dicaearchus , demetrius of phalerum , eudemos of rhodes , harpalus , hephaestion , mnason of phocis , nicomachus , and theophrastus
aristotles influence over alexander the great is seen in the latters bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists , botanists , and researchers
he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher
although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotles geography was clearly wrong , when the old philosopher released his works to the public , alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines ; for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all mens common property
after theophrastus , the lyceum failed to produce any original work
though interest in aristotles ideas survived , they were generally taken unquestioningly
it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found
the first medical teacher at alexandria , herophilus of chalcedon , corrected aristotle , placing intelligence in the brain , and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation
herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries , noting that the latter pulse while the former do not
greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus
the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus , elias , and david in the sixth century , and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century
philoponus questioned aristotles teaching of physics , noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations
after a hiatus of several centuries , formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries , apparently sponsored by anna comnena
aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology
most of the still extant works of aristotle , and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers
the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars , and was later used by western philosophers ( as in the famous poem of dante ) who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy
with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west , aristotle was practically unknown there from c
ad 600 to c
1100 except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius
in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made , both from arabic translations , such as those by gerard of cremona , the demand for aristotles writings grew , and the greek manuscripts returned to the west , stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance
a cautionary medieval tale held that aristotle advised his pupil alexander to avoid the kings seductive mistress , phyllis , but was himself captivated by her , and allowed her to ride him
phyllis had secretly told alexander what to expect , and he witnessed phyllis proving that a womans charms could overcome even the greatest philosophers male intellect
artists such as hans baldung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme
besides dantes fellow poets , the classical figure that most influenced the comedy is aristotle
dante built up the philosophy of the comedy with the works of aristotle as a foundation , just as the scholastics used aristotle as the basis for their thinking
dante knew aristotle directly from latin translations of his works and indirectly quotations in the works of albert magnus
dante even acknowledges aristotles influence explicitly in the poem , specifically when virgil justifies the infernos structure by citing the nicomachean ethics
moses maimonides ( considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of medieval judaism ) adopted aristotelianism from the islamic scholars and based his guide for the perplexed on it and that became the basis of jewish scholastic philosophy
maimonides also considered aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived , and styled him as the chief of the philosophers
also , in his letter to samuel ibn tibbon , maimonides observes that there is no need for samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded aristotle because the works of the latter are sufficient by themselves and superior to all that were written before them
his intellect , aristotles is the extreme limit of human intellect , apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy , there being no level higher
in the early modern period , scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen , establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment
harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood , establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the bodys heat , as aristotle thought
the 19th - century german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle
and the natural superiority ( virtue , arete ) of others
it was martin heidegger , not nietzsche , who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle , intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition
the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotles logic , but decided to go under , over , and beyond it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book the laws of thought
this gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations , enables it to solve equations as well as check validity , and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms , not just two
charles darwin regarded aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology
in an 1882 letter he wrote that linnaeus and cuvier have been my two gods , though in very different ways , but they were mere schoolboys to old aristotle
also , in later editions of the book on the origin of species , darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as aristotle ;
james joyces favoured philosopher was aristotle , whom he considered to be the greatest thinker of all times
karl marx considered aristotle to be the greatest thinker of antiquity , and called him a giant thinker , a genius , and the great scholar
argued that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine
russell called aristotles ethics repulsive , and labelled his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy
russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle , until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors
the dutch historian of science eduard jan dijksterhuis wrote that aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by proceeding so readily to frame a theory of such a general character on limited evidence from their senses
tones that aristotle had assembled a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay , imperfect observation , wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility
hobbes rejected one of the most famous theses of aristotles politics , namely that human beings are naturally suited to life in a polis and do not fully realize their natures until they exercise the role of citizen
by the start of the 21st century , however , aristotle was taken more seriously kukkonen noted that in the best 20th - century scholarship aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition
kukkonen observed , too , that that most enduring of romantic images , aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander remained current , as in the 2004 film alexander , while the firm rules of aristotles theory of drama have ensured a role for the poetics in hollywood
biologists continue to be interested in aristotles thinking
armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotles biology ,
the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum
these texts , as opposed to aristotles lost works , are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotles school
reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekkers royal prussian academy edition ( aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica , berlin , 1831–1870 ) , which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works
aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls , the common writing medium of that era
his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric , intended for the public , and the esoteric , for use within the lyceum school
the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotles school which existed in the form of smaller , separate works , distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics , edited them , and finally compiled them into the more cohesive , larger works as they are known today
aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder , rembrandt , rembrandts aristotle with a bust of homer , too , is a celebrated work , showing the knowing philosopher and the blind homer from an earlier age as the art critic jonathan jones writes , this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world , ensnaring us in its musty , glowing , pitch - black , terrible knowledge of time

the aristotle mountains in antarctica are named after aristotle
he was the first person known to conjecture , in his book meteorology , the existence of a landmass in the southern high - latitude region and called it antarctica
an american in paris is a jazz - influenced orchestral piece by american composer george gershwin first performed in 1928
it was inspired by the time that gershwin had spent in paris and evokes the sights and energy of the french capital during the années folles
gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta , saxophones , and automobile horns
he brought back four parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition , which took place on december 13 , 1928 , in carnegie hall , with walter damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic
he collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer deems taylor
although the story is likely apocryphal , gershwin is said to have been attracted by maurice ravels unusual chords , and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in 1926 ready to study with ravel
after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories , ravel said he could not teach him , saying , why be a second - rate ravel when you can be a first - rate gershwin
gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour
to this end , upon his return to new york , gershwin joined the efforts of ravels friend robert schmitz , a pianist ravel had met during the war , to urge ravel to tour the schmitz was the head of pro musica , promoting franco - american musical relations , and was able to offer ravel a 10 , 000 fee for the tour , an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel
gershwin greeted ravel in new york in march 1928 during a party held for ravels birthday by éva gauthier
this did not set gershwin back , as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue
paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers , among them ezra pound , yeats , ernest hemingway , and artist pablo picasso
gershwin explained in musical america , my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city , listens to the various street noises , and absorbs the french atmosphere
the piece is structured into five sections , which culminate in a loose aba format
gershwins first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio
the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six
this a section featured duple meter , singsong rhythms , and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe , english horn , and taxi horns
the b sections andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness
the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve - bar blues
in the b section , gershwin uses common time , syncopated rhythms , and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet , saxophone , and snare drum
moderato con grazia is the last a section that returns to the themes set in after recapitulating the walking themes , gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final grandioso
gershwin did not particularly like walter damroschs interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris
he stated that damroschs sluggish , dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work
the audience , according to edward cushing , responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music , good and bad , ordinarily arouses
critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than gershwins concerto in gershwin responded to the critics
an american in paris was originally scored for 3 flutes ( 3rd doubling on piccolo ) , 2 oboes , english horn , 2 clarinets in b - flat , bass clarinet in b - flat , 2 bassoons , contrabassoon , 4 horns in f , 3 trumpets in b - flat , 3 trombones , tuba , timpani , snare drum , bass drum , triangle , wood block , ratchet , cymbals , low and high tom - toms , xylophone , glockenspiel , celesta , 4 taxi horns labeled as a , b , c , and d with circles around them , alto saxophone , tenor saxophone , baritone saxophone ( all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones ) , and strings
a major revision of the work by composer and arranger campbell - watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments alto , tenor and baritone
this became the standard performing edition until 2000 , when gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris , working directly from gershwins original manuscript , including the restoration of gershwins soprano saxophone parts removed in campbell - watsons revision
gibbons restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at londons queen elizabeth hall on july 9 , 2000 , by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian
on september 22 , 2013 , it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released
the gershwin family , working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan , were working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwins true intent
it was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work ( such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section ) , or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during gershwins composition process
the score to an american in paris was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released
the entire project was expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete , but an american in paris was planned to be an early volume in the series
two urtext editions of the work were published by the german publisher b - note music in 2015
the changes made by campbell - watson were withdrawn in both editions
in the extended urtext , 120 bars of music were re - integrated
conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance
on september 9 , 2017 , the cincinnati symphony orchestra gave the world premiere of the long - awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by mark clague , director of the gershwin initiative at the university of michigan
this performance was of the original 1928 orchestration ,
an american in paris has been frequently recorded
the first recording was made for the victor talking machine company in 1929 with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra , drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra
gershwin was on hand to supervise the recording ; however , shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio
this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a - flat , b - flat , a higher d , and a lower
the radio broadcast of the september 8 , 1937 , hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert , in which an american in paris , also conducted by shilkret , was second on the program , was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two - cd set
arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor , including one of the first stereo recordings of the music
in 1945 , arturo toscanini conducting the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the piece for rca victor , one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer
the seattle symphony also recorded a version in 1990 of gershwins original score , before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today
harry james released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album one night stand , recorded live at the aragon ballroom in chicago ( columbia gl 522 and cl 522 )
in 1951 , metro - goldwyn - mayer released the musical film , an american in paris , featuring gene kelly and leslie caron
winning the 1951 best picture oscar , and numerous other awards , the film was directed by vincente minnelli , featured many tunes of gershwin , and concluded with an extensive , elaborate dance sequence built around the an american in paris symphonic poem ( arranged for the film by johnny green ) , costing 500 , 000
the academy award for best production design recognizes achievement for art direction in film
the categorys original name was best art direction , but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the 85th academy awards
the films below are listed with their production year ( for example , the 2000 academy award for best art direction is given to a film from 1999 )
in the lists below , the winner of the award for each year is shown first , followed by the other nominees in alphabetical order
the academy awards , popularly known as the oscars , given annually by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ( ampas ) , the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements , as assessed by the academys voting membership
the various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette as a trophy , officially called the academy award of merit , although more commonly referred to by its nickname , the oscar
the statuette depicts a knight rendered in the art deco style
the award was originally sculpted by george stanley from a design sketch by cedric gibbons
a total of 3 , 140 oscar statuettes have been awarded since its inception in 1929
they are widely cited as the most prestigious and renowned competitive awards in the field of entertainment
the first academy awards presentation was held on may 16 , 1929 , at a private dinner function at the hollywood roosevelt hotel with an audience of about 270 people
the post - awards party was held at the mayfair hotel
the cost of guest tickets for that nights ceremony was 5 ( at 2020 prices )
fifteen statuettes were awarded , honoring artists , directors and other participants in the film - making industry of the time , for their works during the 1927–28 period
the ceremony ran for 15minutes
for this first ceremony , winners were announced to the media three months earlier
for the second ceremony in 1930 , and the rest of the first decade , the results were given to newspapers for publication at 1100pm on the night of the awards
in 1940 , the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began ; as a result , the following year the academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners
the first best actor awarded was emil jannings , for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh
he had to return to europe before the ceremony , so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier ; this made him the first academy award winner in history
at that time , winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period ; for example , jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period , and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films with the fourth ceremony , however , the system changed , and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film
for the first six ceremonies , the eligibility period spanned two calendar years
at the 29th ceremony , held in 1957 , the best foreign language film category , now known as best international feature film , was introduced
until then , foreign - language films had been honored with the special achievement award
perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was 34 - year - old robert opel , who streaked across the stage of the dorothy chandler pavilion in los angeles flashing a peace sign on national us television at the 46th academy awards in 1974
bemused host david niven quipped , isnt it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings later , evidence arose suggesting that opels appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the shows producer jack haley jr
robert metzler , the shows business manager , believed that the incident had been planned in some way ; during the dress rehearsal niven had asked metzlers wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line , which was thus not the ad - lib it appeared to be
the 74th academy awards , held in 2002 , presented the first academy award for best animated feature
from 1973 to 2020 , all academy awards ceremonies have ended with the academy award for best picture
for 2021 , this tradition was broken as the ceremony ended with the academy award for best actor
traditionally , the previous years winner for best actor and best supporting actor present the awards for best actress and best supporting actress , while the previous years winner for best actress and best supporting actress present the awards for best actor and best supporting actor
on february 9 , 2020 , parasite became the first foreign - language film to win best picture at the award ceremony of 92nd academy awards
tom hanks announced at the 2020 oscar ceremony , the opening of the academy museum of motion pictures on december 14 , 2020
the industry curated exhibits will be geared toward the history of motion picture , the art science of film making , exhibiting trailblazing directors , actors , film - makers , sound editors and more , and will house famous artifacts from acclaimed movies like dorothys ruby red slippers
the 93rd academy awards ceremony , honoring the best films of 2020 and early 2021 , was held on april 25 , 2021 , after it was postponed from its original february 28 , 2021 , schedule due to the impact of the covid - 19 pandemic on cinema
as with two previous ceremonies , there was no host
the ceremony was broadcast on abc
it took place at the dolby theatre in los angeles , california for the 19th consecutive year , along with satellite location taking place at the union station also in los angeles
sculptor george stanley ( who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl ) sculpted cedric gibbons design
the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold - plated solid bronze
within a few years , the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal , a pewter - like alloy which is then plated in copper , nickel silver , and finally , 24 - karat gold
due to a metal shortage during world war ii , oscars were made of painted plaster for three years
following the war , the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold - plated metal ones
approximately 50 oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer owens company
in 2016 , the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes , handing manufacturing duties to walden , new york - based polich tallix fine art foundry
while based on a digital scan of an original 1929 oscar , the statuettes retain their modern - era dimensions and black pedestal
cast in liquid bronze from 3d - printed ceramic molds and polished , they are then electroplated in 24 - karat gold by brooklyn , new york–based epner technology
the time required to produce 50 such statuettes is roughly three months
the academy officially adopted the name oscar for the trophies in 1939
however , the origin of the nickname is disputed
one biography of bette davis , who was a president of the academy in 1941 , claims she named the award after her first husband , band leader harmon oscar nelson
a frequently mentioned originator is margaret herrick , the academy executive director , who , when she first saw the award in 1931 , said the statuette reminded her of uncle oscar , a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce
columnist sidney skolsky , who was present during herricks naming in 1931 , wrote that employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette oscar
the 1934 awards appeared again in another early media mention of oscar a time magazine story
to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony , oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates
until 2010 , winners returned their statuettes to the academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective oscars
since 2010 , winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription - processing station at the governors ball , a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony
the owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony , bearing the name of every potential winner
the nameplates for the non - winning nominees are later recycled
in 1989 , michael todds grandson tried to sell todds best picture oscar for his 1956 production of around the world in 80 days to a movie prop collector
the academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale
in 1992 , harold russell consigned his 1946 oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to auction to raise money for his wifes medical expenses
though his decision caused controversy , the first - ever oscar to be sold passed to a private collector on august 6 , 1992 for 60 , 500 (
in december 2011 , orson welles 1941 oscar for citizen kane ( academy award for best original screenplay ) was put up for auction , after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy
some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy , which keeps them in its treasury
in addition to the academy award of merit ( oscar award ) , there are nine honorary ( non - competitive ) awards presented by the academy from time to time ( except for the academy honorary award , the technical achievement award , and the student academy awards , which are presented annually )
from 2004 to 2020 , the academy award nomination results were announced to the public in mid - january
prior to that , the results were announced in early february
in 2021 , the nominees were announced in march
in 2022 , the nominees were announced in early february for the first time since 2003
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ( ampas ) , a professional honorary organization , maintains a voting membership of over 7 , 000
academy membership is divided into different branches , with each representing a different discipline in film production
actors constitute the largest voting bloc , numbering 1 , 311 members ( 22 percent ) of the academys composition
votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers ( and its predecessor price waterhouse ) since the 7th academy awards in 1935
the firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the academy in december to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in january of the next year , then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours
all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors , on behalf of academy branch executive committees
membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures
new membership proposals are considered annually
the academy does not publicly disclose its membership , although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join
the 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6 , 000 voting members
while the membership had been growing , stricter policies have kept its size steady since then
in 2012 , the results of a study conducted by the los angeles times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88 of ampas voting membership
of the 5 , 100 active voters confirmed , 94 were caucasian , 77 were male , and 54 were found to be over the age of 60
33 of voting members are former nominees ( 14 ) and winners ( 19 )
in may 2011 , the academy sent a letter advising its 6 , 000 or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting would be implemented in 2013
according to rules 2 and 3 of the official academy awards rules , a film must open in the previous calendar year , from midnight at the start of january 1 to midnight at the end of december 31 , in los angeles county , california , and play for seven consecutive days , to qualify ( except for the best international feature film , best documentary feature , and awards in short film categories )
additionally , the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run , with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6pm and 10pm local time
for example , the 2009 best picture winner , the hurt locker , was originally first released in 2008 , but did not qualify for the 2008 awards , as it did not play its oscar - qualifying run in los angeles until mid - 2009 , thus qualifying for the 2009 awards
foreign films must include english subtitles , and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the international feature film category per year
rule 2 states that a film must be feature - length , defined as a minimum of 40minutes , except for short - subject awards , and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24frame / s or 48frame / s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels
the best international feature film award does not require a release
it requires the film to be submitted as its countrys official selection
the best documentary feature award requires either week - long releases in both los angeles county and new york city during the previous calendar year , or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the documentary feature qualifying festival list ( regardless of any public exhibition or distribution ) , or submission in the international feature film category as its countrys official selection
the qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non - documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings
additionally , a film must have been reviewed by a critic from the new york times , time out new york , the los angeles times , or la weekly
producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline ; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline , the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year
the form includes the production credits for all related categories
then , each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases
awards in short film categories ( best documentary short subject , best animated short film , and best live action short film ) have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards
first , the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year , instead of covering one year starting on october 1 and ending on september 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony
second , there are multiple methods of qualification
the main method is a week - long theatrical release in either los angeles county or new york city during the eligibility period
films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the academy , also without regard to prior public distribution
finally , a film that is selected as a gold , silver , or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous student academy awards is also eligible ( documentary category for that award , and animation , narrative , alternative , or international for the other awards )
the requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards
only one screening per day is required
for the documentary award , the screening must start between noon and 10pm local time ; for other awards , no specific start time is required , but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times
in late december , ballots , and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around 6 , 000 active members
for most categories , members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories ( that is only directors vote for directors , writers for writers , actors for actors , etcetera )
in the special case of best picture , all voting members are eligible to select the nominees
in all major categories , a variant of the single transferable vote is used , with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees ( ten for best picture ) ranked preferentially
in certain categories , including international feature film , documentary and animated feature , nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches
in most categories , the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members
since 2009 , the best picture winner has been chosen by instant runoff voting
since 2013 , re - weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects
film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture , in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season
the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified
it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders
for example , a producer of the 2009 best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front - runner ( the hurt locker eventually won )
the academy screening room or academy digital screening room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the academy to view all eligible films ( except , initially , those in the international category ) in one place
it was introduced in 2019 , for the 2020 oscars , though dvd screeners and academy in - person screenings were still provided
for films to be included on the platform , the north american distributor must pay 12 , 500 , including a watermarking fee , and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the academy
the platform can be accessed via apple tv and roku players
the watermarking process involved several video security firms , creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings
in 2021 , for the 2022 oscars , the academy banned all physical screeners and in - person screenings , restricting official membership viewing to the academy screening room
films eligible in the documentary and international categories were made available in different sections of the platform
distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform
eligible films do not have to be added to the platform , but the academy advertises them to voting members when they are
the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony , commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year , and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees
it is the culmination of the film awards season , which usually begins during november or december of the previous year
this is an elaborate extravaganza , with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day
black tie dress is the most common outfit for men , although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow - tie , and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this
( the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony , and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast
the academy awards is the worlds longest - running awards show televised live from the to all - time zones in north america and worldwide , and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world
the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets ( especially those outside of the americas ) in more desirable local timeslots
the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970 , but only two south american countries , chile and brazil , purchased the rights to air the broadcast
by that time , the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in 50 countries
a decade later , the rights were already being sold to 60 countries , and by 1984 , the tv rights to the awards were licensed in 76 countries
the ceremonies were moved up from late march / early april to late february , since 2004 , to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry
another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa basketball tournament , which would cut into the academy awards audience
( in 1976 and 1977 , abcs regained oscars were moved from tuesday to monday and went directly opposite nbcs ncaa title game
) the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc , as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period
some years , the ceremony is moved into the first sunday of march to avoid a clash with the winter olympic games
another reason for the move to late february and early march is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter , which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public
after many years of being held on mondays at 900pm eastern / 600 p
m pacific , since the 1999 ceremonies , it was moved to sundays at 830pm et / 530pm pt
for many years the film industry opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office
in 2018 , the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to mid february beginning with the 92nd academy awards in 2020
originally scheduled for april 8 , 1968 , the 40th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days , because of the assassination of dr
martin luther king , jr
on march 30 , 1981 , the 53rd academy awards was postponed for one day , after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington ,
in 1993 , an in memoriam segment was introduced , this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names
criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect , with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subjects cultural impact ; the applause has since been muted during the telecast , and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead
this segment was later followed by a commercial break
in terms of broadcast length , the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours
the first oscars , in 1929 , lasted 15minutes
at the other end of the spectrum , the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty - three minutes
in 2016 , in a further effort to streamline speeches , winners dedications were displayed on an on - screen ticker
the wall street journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the 2014–2018 telecasts as follows 14 on song performances ; 25 on the hosts speeches ; 38 on prerecorded clips ; and 78 on the awards themselves , broken into 24 on the introduction and announcement , 24 on winners walking to the stage , and 30 on their acceptance speeches
although still dominant in ratings , the viewership of the academy awards has steadily dropped ; the 88th academy awards were the lowest - rated in the past eight years ( although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership ) , while the show itself also faced mixed reception
following the show , variety reported that abc was , in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars , seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself
currently and nominally , ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast , including the choice of production staff and hosting , although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions
historically , the telecasts viewership is higher when box - office hits are favored to win the best picture award
more than 57million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th academy awards in 1998 , the year of titanic , which generated a box office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of us600million in the us , a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years
the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date , however , was the 42nd academy awards ( best picture midnight cowboy ) which drew a 43 household rating on april 7 , 1970
by contrast , ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings , despite how much critical acclaim those films have received
the 78th academy awards which awarded low - budget independent film crash ( with a pre - oscar gross of us53million ) generated an audience of 38million with a household rating of 22
the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film ( no country for old men )
whereas the 92nd academy awards drew an average of 23million viewers , that is the lowest viewership recorded by nielsen since it started recording audience totals in 1974
the academy film archive holds copies of every academy awards ceremony since the 1949 oscars and material on many prior ceremonies , along with ancillary material related to more recent shows
copies are held in a variety of film , video , and digital formats
in 1929 , the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel
from 1930 to 1943 , the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles
graumans chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946 , followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from 1947 to 1948
the 21st academy awards in 1949 were held at the academy award theatre at what had been the academys headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood
from 1950 to 1960 , the awards were presented at hollywoods pantages theatre
with the advent of television , the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york , first at the nbc international theatre ( 1953 ) and then at the nbc century theatre , after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles
the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica , california , in 1961
by 1969 , the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to downtown los angeles , this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center
in the late 1990s and early 2000s , the ceremony returned to the shrine
in 2002 , hollywoods dolby theatre ( previously known as the kodak theatre ) became the presentations current venue
in the first year of the awards , the best directing award was split into two categories ( drama and comedy )
at times , the best original score award has also been split into separate categories ( drama and comedy / musical )
from the 1930s through the 1960s , the art direction ( now production design ) , cinematography , and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories ( black - and - white films and color films )
prior to 2012 , the production design award was called art direction , while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup
in august 2018 , the academy announced that several categories would not be televised live , but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony
following dissent from academy members , they announced that they would indeed air all 24 categories live
this followed several proposals ( among them , the introduction of a popular film category ) that the academy had announced but did not implement
the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories
to date , the following categories have been proposed
the special academy awards are voted on by special committees , rather than by the academy membership as a whole
they are not always presented on an annual basis
due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards , many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season
this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality
william friedkin , an academy award - winning film director and former producer of the ceremony , expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in 2009 , describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself
a recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the oscar season is the whisper campaign
these campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie
examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against zero dark thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that lincoln distorts history
typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over - representation of romantic historical epics , biographical dramas , romantic dramedies and family melodramas , most of which are released in the in the last three months of the calendar year
the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded
the term oscar bait was coined to describe such movies
this has led , at times , to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience , for example , by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues
the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees
due to a variety of reasons , including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples , a number of high - profile oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals , as well as performances of asian characters rewritten for white characters
the 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott , popularized on social media with the hashtag oscarssowhite , based on activists perception that its all - white acting nominee list reflected bias
acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity , to make up for a snub for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded , or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominees entire body of work
following the 91st academy awards in february 2019 in which the netflix - broadcast film roma had been nominated for ten awards including the best picture category , steven spielberg and other members of the academy discussed changing the requirements through the board of governors for films as to exclude those from netflix and other media streaming services
spielberg had been concerned that netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical oscar - winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other best picture - nominated films , while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical - run status to qualify for an oscar
following its april 2019 board meeting , the academy board of governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs
during the 94th academy awards on march 27 , 2022 , chris rock joked about jada pinkett smiths shaved head , rock decided not to press charges against smith
some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars
the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols ( best writing in 1935 for the informer )
nichols boycotted the 8th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild
nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later , at the 1938 ceremony
nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career
george scott became the second person to refuse his award ( best actor in 1970 for patton ) at the 43rd academy awards ceremony
scott described it as a meat parade , saying , i dont want any part of it
the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando , who refused his award ( best actor for 1972s the godfather ) , citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of native americans
at the 45th academy awards ceremony , brando asked actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read a 15 - page speech in his place , detailing his criticisms , for which there was booing and cheering by the audience
some advocates of gender equality and non - binary people have criticized the separation of male and female acting categories in the academy awards , emmy awards and tony awards
though some commentators worry that gender discrimination would cause men to dominate unsegregated categories , other categories are unsegregated
it has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the oscars
in recent years , these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners
the value has risen to the point where the internal revenue service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status
oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to hawaii and mexico and japan , a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant , videophones , a four - night stay at a hotel , watches , bracelets , spa treatments , bottles of vodka , maple salad dressing , weight - loss gummie candy and up to 25 , 000 worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from new york city facial plastic surgeon konstantin vasyukevich
some of the gifts have even had a risque element to them ; in 2014 , the adult products retailer adam eve had a secret room gifting suite
celebrities visiting the gifting suite included judith hoag , carolyn hennesy , kate linder , chris mulkey , jim oheir , and john salley
the term oscar is a registered trademark of the ampas ; however , in the italian language , it is used generically to refer to any award or award ceremony , regardless of which field
actresses ( catalan actrius ) is a 1997 catalan language spanish drama film produced and directed by ventura pons and based on the award - winning stage play by josep maria benet i jornet
the film has no male actors , with all roles played by females
in order to prepare herself to play a role commemorating the life of legendary actress empar ribera , young actress ( mercè pons ) interviews three established actresses who had been the riberas pupils the international diva glòria marc ( núria espert ) , the television star assumpta roca ( rosa maria sardà ) , and dubbing director maria caminal ( anna lizaran )
actrius screened in 2001 at the graumans egyptian theatre in an american cinematheque retrospective of the works of its director
the film had first screened at the same location in 1998
it was also shown at the 1997 stockholm international film festival
in movie - film - review , christopher tookey wrote that though the actresses were competent in roles that may have some reference to their own careers , the film is visually unimaginative , never escapes its stage origins , and is almost totally lacking in revelation or surprising incident
noting that there were occasional , refreshing moments of intergenerational bitchiness , they did not justify comparisons to all about eve , and were insufficiently different to deserve critical parallels with rashomon
he also wrote that the guardian called the film a slow , stuffy chamber - piece , and that the evening standard stated the films best moments exhibit the bitchy tantrums seething beneath the threesomes composed veneers
animalia is an illustrated childrens book by graeme base
it was originally published in 1986 , followed by a tenth anniversary edition in 1996 , and a 25th anniversary edition in 2012
over four million copies have been sold worldwide
animalia is an alliterative alphabet book and contains twenty - six illustrations , one for each letter of the alphabet
each illustration features an animal from the animal kingdom ( a is for alligator and armadillo , b is for butterfly , etcetera ) along with a short poem utilizing the letter of the page for many of the words
the illustrations contain many other objects beginning with that letter that the reader can try to identify ( however , there are not necessarily a thousand things , or maybe more , as the author states )
as an additional challenge , the author has hidden a picture of himself as a child in every picture
here are some of the things in each picture that are truly different ( the alligator in the a section is wearing an apron featuring the alphabet , which the book is about , and this section also features the authors home country , australia )
antelope ( this is actually a pronghorn , which is not a true antelope , so it belongs in the p section ) - word
abrams published the animalia wall frieze , a fold - out over 26 feet in length , in which the author created new riddles for each letter
a television series was also created , based on the book , which airs in the united states , australia , canada , the united kingdom , norway and venezuela
it also airs on minimax for the czech republic and slovakia
and recently in greece on the channel et1
the australian childrens television foundation released a teaching resource dvd - rom in 2011 to accompany the tv series with teaching aids for classroom use
in 2010 , the base factory and appbooks released animalia as an application for ipad and iphone / ipod touch
the childrens book council of australia designated animalia a 1987 picture book of the year honour book
international atomic time ( tai , from the french name ) is a high - precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on earths geoid
utc is currently exactly 37 seconds behind tai
the 37 seconds result from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972 , plus 27 leap seconds in utc since 1972
tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days , carried over from non - uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth
specifically , both julian days and the gregorian calendar are used
tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of 1958 , and the two have drifted apart ever since , due to the changing motion of the earth
tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over 400 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories worldwide
cite web
the clocks are compared using gps signals and two - way satellite time and frequency transfer
due to the signal averaging tai is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock
the participating institutions each broadcast , in real time , a frequency signal with timecodes , which is their estimate of tai
time codes are usually published in the form of utc , which differs from tai by a well - known integer number of seconds
these time scales are denoted in the form utc ( npl ) in the utc form , where npl identifies the national physical laboratory , uk
the tai form may be denoted tai ( npl )
the latter is not to be confused with ta ( npl ) , which denotes an independent atomic time scale , not synchronised to tai or to anything else
the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other
the international bureau of weights and measures ( bipm , france ) , combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible
this combined time scale is published monthly in circular t , and is the canonical tai
this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc − utc ( k ) ( equivalent to tai − tai ( k ) ) for each participating institution k
the same circular also gives tables of tai − ta ( k ) , for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales
errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular aside from this , once published in circular t , the tai scale is not revised
in hindsight , it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale
since the published circulars are definitive , better estimates do not create another version of tai ; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time ( tt )
early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock ; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously
atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955 , using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory , uk ( npl )
it was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the royal greenwich observatory and to establish a time scale , called greenwich atomic ( ga )
the united states naval observatory began the 1 scale on 13 september 1956 , using an atomichron commercial atomic clock , followed by the nbs - a scale at the national bureau of standards , boulder , colorado on 9 october 1957
the international time bureau ( bih ) began a time scale , tm or am , in july 1955 , using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals
the bih scale , 1 , and nbs - a were defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958 the procedures used by the bih evolved , and the name for the time scale changed a3 in 1964
the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967
from 1971 to 1975 the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee for weights and measures made a series of decisions which designated the bipm time scale international atomic time ( tai )
in the 1970s , it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation , and the combined tai scale , therefore , corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks
starting from the julian date 2443144 ( 1 january 1977 000000 ) , corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks , so that tai would correspond to proper time at the geoid ( mean sea level )
because the clocks were , on average , well above sea level , this meant that tai slowed by about one part in a trillion
the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal ( échelle atomique libre , meaning free atomic scale )
the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time ( tcb ) , geocentric coordinate time ( tcg ) , and terrestrial time ( tt ) , which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system
tai was henceforth a realisation of tt , with the equation tt ( tai ) tai 32s
the continued existence of tai was questioned in a 2007 letter from the bipm to the itu - r which stated , in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds , the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai , as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc
cite web
utc is a discontinuous time scale
it is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds
between these adjustments , it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time
from its beginning in 1961 through december 1971 , the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut2
afterward , these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut1
this was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale
the less frequent whole - second adjustments meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally
the fact that it continues to approximate ut1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc
altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings or other animals , resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual
it is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious and secular worldviews
however , the object ( s ) of concern vary among cultures and religions
in an extreme case , altruism may become a synonym of selflessness , which is the opposite of selfishness
the word altruism was popularized ( and possibly coined ) by the french philosopher auguste comte in french , as altruisme , for an antonym of egoism
he derived it from the italian altrui , which in turn was derived from latin alteri , meaning other people or somebody else
altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves ( for example , pleasure and quality of life , time , probability of survival or reproduction ) , but benefits , either directly or indirectly , another individual , without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action
steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting , that is intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards
in one sense , the opposite of altruism is spite ; a spiteful action harms another with no self - benefit
altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty or concern for the common good
the latter are predicated upon social relationships , whilst altruism does not consider relationships
much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology
the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing , helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic , as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification
the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as benefits
the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others
used in this sense , it is usually contrasted with egoism , which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first
effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others
the concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought
the term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science , auguste comte , and has become a major topic for psychologists ( especially evolutionary psychology researchers ) , evolutionary biologists , and ethologists
whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields , the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism
in simple terms , altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them
marcel mausss essay the gift contains a passage called note on alms this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms ( and by extension of altruism ) from the notion of sacrifice
in it , he writes
alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand , and of a notion of sacrifice , on the other
generosity is an obligation , because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it
this is the ancient morality of the gift , which has become a principle of justice
the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children
in the science of ethology ( the study of animal behaviour ) , and more generally in the study of social evolution , altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor
theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins
two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies
hunters widely sharing the meat has been seen as a costly signal of ability and research has found that good hunters have higher reproductive success and more adulterous relations even if they themselves receive no more of the hunted meat than anyone else
similarly , holding large feasts and giving large donations has been seen as ways of demonstrating ones resources
heroic risk - taking has also been interpreted as a costly signal of ability
both indirect reciprocity and costly signaling depend on the value of reputation and tend to make similar predictions
one is that people will be more helping when they know that their helping behavior will be communicated to people they will interact with later , is publicly announced , is discussed , or is simply being observed by someone else
this have been documented in many studies
the effect is sensitive to subtle cues such as people being more helpful when there were stylized eyespots instead of a logo on a computer screen
weak reputational cues such as eyespots may become unimportant if there are stronger cues present and may lose their effect with continued exposure unless reinforced with real reputational effects
public displays such as public weeping for dead celebrities and participation in demonstrations may be influenced by a desire to be seen as altruistic
people who know that they are publicly monitored sometimes even wastefully donate money they know are not needed by recipient which may be because of reputational concerns
wendy iredal and mark van vugt
altruism as showing off a signaling perspective on promoting green behaviour and acts of kindness
women have been found to find altruistic men to be attractive partners
when looking for a long - term partner , altruism may be a preferred trait as it may indicate that he is also willing to share resources with her and her children
it has been shown that men perform altruistic acts in the early stages of a romantic relationship or simply when in the presence of an attractive woman
while both sexes state that kindness is the most preferable trait in a partner there is some evidence that men place less value on this than women and that women may not be more altruistic in presence of an attractive man
men may even avoid altruistic women in short - term relationships which may be because they expect less success
people may compete for social benefit from a burnished reputation , which may cause competitive altruism
on the other hand , in some experiments a proportion of people do not seem to care about reputation and they do not help more even if this is conspicuous
this may possibly be due to reasons such as psychopathy or that they are so attractive that they need not be seen to be altruistic
the reputational benefits of altruism occur in the future as compared to the immediate costs of altruism in the present
while humans and other organisms generally place less value on future costs / benefits as compared to those in the present , some have shorter time horizons than others and these people tend to be less cooperative
explicit extrinsic rewards and punishments have been found to sometimes actually have the opposite effect on behaviors compared to intrinsic rewards
this may be because such extrinsic , top - down incentives may replace ( partially or in whole ) intrinsic and reputational incentives , motivating the person to focus on obtaining the extrinsic rewards , which overall may make the behaviors less desirable
another effect is that people would like altruism to be due to a personality characteristic rather than due to overt reputational concerns and simply pointing out that there are reputational benefits of an action may actually reduce them
this may possibly be used as derogatory tactic against altruists , especially by those who are non - cooperators
a counterargument is that doing good due to reputational concerns is better than doing no good at all

such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts
instead , evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms , such as emotions , that promote altruistic behaviors
every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness ; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment
this need not imply that on average 50 or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment ; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits
the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups
research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no - kin , to friends than to strangers , to those attractive than to those unattractive , to non - competitors than to competitors , and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup
the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george prices development of the price equation , which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution
an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds , such as dictyostelium mucoroides
these protists live as individual amoebae until starved , at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body
selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds , and associated emotional , cognitive , and neurohormonal mechanisms , evolved in order to facilitate long - term , high - cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success
such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left - wing politics such by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his 1902 book mutual aid a factor of evolution and moral philosopher peter singer in his book a darwinian left
jorge moll and jordan grafman , neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labs - dor hospital network ( ) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers , using functional magnetic resonance imaging
in their research , published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october 2006 , they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway , a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex
however , when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations , another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual cortex / septal region
these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species
altruism , the experiment suggested , was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain , hard - wired and pleasurable

in fact , in an experiment published in march 2007 at the university of southern california neuroscientist antonio damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers , and that when confronted with moral dilemmas , these brain - damaged patients coldly came up with end - justifies - the - means answers , leading damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions , but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue – in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city – these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains
according to adrian raine , a clinical neuroscientist also at the university of southern california , one of this studys implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse
without that awareness , people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets
does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability
in another study , in the 1990s , dr
bill harbaugh , a university of oregon economist , concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fmri scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist colleague dr
ulrich mayr , reached the same conclusions of jorge moll and jordan grafman about giving to charity , although they were able to divide the study group into two groups egoists and altruists
one of their discoveries was that , though rarely , even some of the considered egoists sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others , leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity , such as a persons environment and values
the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing anothers welfare
psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism , which refers to the motivation to increase ones own welfare
there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism
batson , ( 2011 )
altruism in humans
new york , ny us oxford university press
some definitions specify a self - sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors
daniel batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory
he identified four major motives to ultimately benefit the self ( egoism ) , to ultimately benefit the other person ( altruism ) , to benefit a group ( collectivism ) , or to uphold a moral principle ( principlism )
altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism , but the general conclusion has been that empathy - induced altruism can be genuinely selfless
in psychological research on altruism , studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping , comforting , sharing , cooperation , philanthropy , and community service
research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the persons distress
research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping ( the bystander effect )
greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility
however , a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders
many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism ( as a form of altruism ) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well - being
in a study of older adults , those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live , and lower in depression , anxiety , and somatization
one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30 - year period and found that 52 of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36 of those who did volunteer experienced one
merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well - being
a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness
studies have also been careful to note that feeling over - taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness
for example , one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one ( although positive effects were still significant )
pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme , and either harms the altruistic person , or well - intentioned actions cause more harm than good
examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals , an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of ones own needs , hoarding of animals , and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid
sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society ( altruism , morality , and social solidarity
american sociological association
most , if not all , of the worlds religions promote altruism as a very important moral value
buddhism , christianity , hinduism , islam , jainism , judaism , and sikhism , etcetera , place particular emphasis on altruistic morality
altruism figures prominently in buddhism
love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism , and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy , and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering
many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion
these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness , and the need for them lies at the very core of our being ( dalai lama )
http / / www
htm speech by the dalai lama
still , the notion of altruism is modified in such a world - view , since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others , the greater our own sense of well - being becomes ( dalai lama )
in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment , buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative ( unhappy ) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment , but from the law of karma , which functions like a natural law of cause and effect
a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes if one causes suffering , then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering ; if one causes happiness , then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness
the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism , not only for humans but for all sentient beings
jainism preaches the view of ahimsa – to live and let live , thereby not harming sentient beings , that is uncompromising reverence for all life
it also considers all living things to be equal
the first tirthankara , rishabhdev , introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings , from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation , giving oneself up for others , non - violence and compassion for all living things
jainism prescribes a path of non - violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal
a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors
ones unconquered mind with anger , pride ( ego ) , deceit , greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans
anger spoils good relations , pride destroys humility , deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything
jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness , pride by humility , deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment
jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation , one must practice the following ethical principles ( major vows ) in thought , speech and action
the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks
they are
the great vows ( mahavrata ) are prescribed for monks and limited vows ( anuvrata ) are prescribed for householders
the house - holders are encouraged to practice the above - mentioned five vows
the monks have to observe them very strictly
with consistent practice , it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually , accelerating the spiritual progress
the principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul
jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha ( god in jainism )
because all living beings possess a soul , great care and awareness is essential in ones actions
jainism emphasizes the equality of all life , advocating harmlessness towards all , whether the creatures are great or small
this policy extends even to microscopic organisms jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders
st thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourself as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others
considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship and quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves , he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves , we naturally seek the common good , the good of the whole , more than any private good , the good of a part
however , he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours , and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude a more desirable thing than bodily well - being
in coining the word altruism , as stated above , comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine , which is present in some theological schools within catholicism
many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god
1 john 4 states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman , and that hatred of ones fellowman is the same as hatred of god
thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love
an altruistic action is not always a loving action
oord defines altruism as acting for the others good , and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for ones own good when the others demands undermine overall well - being
german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak
one way is a sincere expression of christian love , motivated by a powerful feeling of security , strength , and inner salvation , of the invincible fullness of ones own life and existence
at its worst , scheler says , love for the small , the poor , the weak , and the oppressed is really disguised hatred , repressed envy , an impulse to detract , etcetera , directed against the opposite phenomena wealth , strength , power , largesse
in islam , the concept īthār ( إيثار ) ( altruism ) is the notion of preferring others to oneself
for sufis , this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of ones own concerns , where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by allah ( that is god ) on the human body , considered to be property of allah alone
the importance of īthār lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good ; islam considers those practicing īthār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility
this is similar to the notion of chivalry , but unlike that european concept , in īthār attention is focused on everything in existence
a constant concern for allah results in a careful attitude towards people , animals , and other things in this world
judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation
the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity
modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag , in his writings about the future generation , focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework
altruism is essential to the sikh religion
the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love , affection , sacrifice , patience , harmony , truthfulness
the concept of seva , or selfless service to the community for its own sake , is an important concept in sikhism
the fifth guru , arjun dev , sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth , the greatest gift to humanity , the guru granth
the ninth guru , tegh bahadur , sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity
in the late seventeenth century , guru gobind singh ( the tenth guru in sikhism ) , was at war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh , bhai kanhaiya , attended the troops of the enemy
he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield
some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy
sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh , and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield
what were you doing , and why asked the guru
i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them , replied bhai kanhaiya
the guru responded , then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds
you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru
under the tutelage of the guru , bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism , which is still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service
in hinduism selflessness ( atmatyag ) , love ( prema ) , kindness ( daya ) and forgiveness ( kshama ) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or manushyattva
giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a divine act or punya and hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or paapa and will led them to heaven or swarga in afterlife
altruism is also the central act of various hindu mythology and religious poems and songs
the founder of warkari samprdaya the great saint dhnyaneshwar maharaj ( 1275 - 1296 ) in his pasaydan pray to the supreme lord vitthal for the wellbeing of all living organisms of the universe
swami vivekananda , the legendary hindu monk , has said - jive prem kare jeijon , seijon sebiche iswar ( whoever loves any living being , is serving god
mass donation of clothes to poor people ( vastraseva ) , or blood donation camp or mass food donation ( annaseva ) for poor people is common in various hindu religious ceremonies
swami sivananda , an advaita scholar , reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the brahma sutras , a vedantic text
in his commentary on chapter 3 of the brahma sutras , sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short - lived , and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed
hence , karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to ones merit
furthermore , one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya , which gives fruit
since apurva is non - sentient , it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god
it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment
however the very well known and popular text , the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga ( achieving oneness with god through action ) nishkam karma or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism
altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and is central to hindu morality
there exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans obligations or motivations to act altruistically
proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically
the opposing view is ethical egoism , which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self - interest
both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism , which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co - inhabitants
a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism , the thesis that humans always act in their own self - interest and that true altruism is impossible
rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in ones self - interest ( without specifying how this affects ones moral obligations )
effective altruism is a philosophy and social movement that uses evidence and reasoning to determine the most effective ways to benefit others
it is the broad , evidence - based and cause - neutral approach that distinguishes effective altruism from traditional altruism or charity
effective altruism is part of the larger movement towards evidence - based practices
while a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the nonprofit sector , the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects , companies , and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives , help people , or otherwise have the biggest benefit
facebook co founder dustin moskovitz , ben delo , and toby ord ,
the genes oxtr , cd38 , comt , drd4 , drd5 , igf2 , and gabrb2 have been found to be candidate genes for altruism
digital altruism is the notion that some are willing to freely share information based on the principle of reciprocity and in the belief that in the end , everyone benefits from sharing information via the internet
this term is coined by dr
dana klisanin , the founder and ceo of evolutionary guidance media rd inc
, and is a recipient of the early career award for scientific achievement in media psychology from the american psychological associations division of media psychology
according to klisanin , the notion that some are willing to freely reveal what they know is interesting
there are three types of digital altruism ( 1 ) everyday digital altruism , involving expedience , ease , moral engagement , and conformity ; ( 2 ) creative digital altruism , involving creativity , heightened moral engagement , and cooperation ; and ( 3 ) co - creative digital altruism involving creativity , moral engagement , and meta cooperative efforts
alice oconnor ( born alisa zinovyevna rosenbaum ;
most sources transliterate her given name as either alisa or alissa
) , was a russian - born american writer and philosopher
she is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named objectivism
born and educated in russia , she moved to the united states in 1926
after two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two broadway plays , she achieved fame with her 1943 novel , the fountainhead
in 1957 , rand published her best - known work , the novel atlas shrugged
afterward , until her death in 1982 , she turned to non - fiction to promote her philosophy , publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays
rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge ; she rejected faith and religion
she supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism
in politics , she condemned the initiation of force as immoral although rand opposed libertarianism , which she viewed as anarchism , she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the united states
in art , rand promoted romantic realism
she was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her , except for aristotle , thomas aquinas , and classical liberals
rands fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics
academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy because of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor
the objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas , both to the public and in academic settings
rand was born alisa zinovyevna rosenbaum on february2 , 1905 , to a russian - jewish bourgeois family living in saint petersburg
and the family fled to the city of yevpatoria in crimea , which was initially under the control of the white army during the russian civil war
she returned with her family to petrograd ( as saint petersburg was then named ) , where they faced desperate conditions , occasionally nearly starving
when russian universities were opened to women after the revolution , she was in the first group of women to enroll at petrograd state university
along with many other bourgeois students , she was purged from the university shortly before graduating
after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists , many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate , which she did in october 1924
by this time , she had decided her professional surname for writing would be rand , )
of her birth surname some biographical sources question this , suggesting it may come from a nickname based on the hebrew word letters from rands family do not use such a nickname for her
the life of ayn rand writing , reading , and related life events
in late 1925 , rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in chicago
and arrived in new york city on february19 , 1926
in hollywood , a chance meeting with famed director cecil demille led to work as an extra in his film the king of kings and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter
so her legal married name became alice oconnor , but she did not use that name publicly or with friends
the life of ayn rand writing , reading , and related life events
rands first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay red pawn to universal studios in 1932 , although it was never produced
her first published novel , the semi - autobiographical we the living , was published in 1936
set in soviet russia , it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state
initial sales were slow , and the american publisher let it go out of print ,
she adapted the story as a stage play , but the broadway production was a failure and closed in less than a week
rand started her next major novel , the fountainhead , in december 1935 , the novella presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word i has been forgotten and replaced with we
it was published in england in 1938 , but rand could not find an american publisher at that time
as with we the living , rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946 , which has sold over 3million copies
during the 1940s , rand became politically active
she and her husband were full - time volunteers for republican wendell willkies 1940 presidential campaign
rands first major success as a writer came in 1943 with the fountainhead , while completing the novel , rand was prescribed the amphetamine benzedrine to fight fatigue
her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings
the success of the fountainhead brought rand fame and financial security
her contract with wallis also allowed time for other projects , including a never - completed nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called the moral basis of individualism
while working in hollywood , rand became involved with the anti - communist motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals and wrote articles on the groups behalf
she also joined the anti - communist american writers association
she also wanted to criticize the lauded 1946 film the best years of our lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world , but was not allowed to do so
after several delays , the film version of the fountainhead was released in 1949
although it used rands screenplay with minimal alterations , she disliked the movie from beginning to end and complained about its editing , the acting and other elements
following the publication of the fountainhead , rand received many letters from readers , some of whom the book had influenced profoundly
in 1954 , her close relationship with nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair , with the knowledge of their spouses
published in 1957 , atlas shrugged was considered rands magnum opus
she described the novels theme as the role of the mind in mans existence—and , as a corollary , the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational self - interest
in 1958 , nathaniel branden established the nathaniel branden lectures , later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute ( nbi ) , to promote rands philosophy through public lectures
he and rand co - founded the objectivist newsletter ( later renamed the objectivist ) in 1962 to circulate articles about her ideas ; and held them to strict standards , sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her
however , some former nbi students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated , and the problem was concentrated among rands closest followers in new york
throughout the 1960s and 1970s , rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at colleges and universities
she began delivering annual lectures at the ford hall forum , responding to questions from the audience
opposing the vietnam war and the military draft ( but condemning many draft dodgers as bums ) , supporting israel in the yom kippur war of 1973 against a coalition of arab nations as civilized men fighting savages , saying european colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by american indians ,
and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting , while also advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it
in 1964 , nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott , whom he later married
nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand
when she learned of it in 1968 , though her romantic relationship with branden had already ended , she published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life
rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking
one of her final projects was work on a never - completed television adaptation of atlas shrugged
on march6 , 1982 , rand died of heart failure at her home in new york city
floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket
rand described her approach to literature as romantic realism
this approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters
her fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic individualists , depicted as fit and attractive
rand considered plot a critical element of literature , romantic triangles are a common plot element in rands fiction ; in most of her novels and plays , the main female character is romantically involved with at least two different men
in school rand read works by fyodor dostoevsky , victor hugo , edmond rostand , and friedrich schiller , who became her favorites
hugo was an important influence on her writing , especially her approach to plotting
in the introduction she wrote for an english - language edition of his novel ninety - three , rand called him the greatest novelist in world literature
although rand disliked most russian literature , her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the russian symbolists and in the destruction of the economy in atlas shrugged
rands descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies ; her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early hollywood movie scenarios
they often follow common film editing conventions , such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene followed by close - up details , and her descriptions of women characters often take a male gaze perspective
rand called her philosophy objectivism , describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being , with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity , and reason as his only absolute
in metaphysics , rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism , including all forms of religion
in epistemology , rand considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception , the validity of which she considered axiomatic ,
rand rejected all claims of non - perceptual knowledge , including
in ethics , rand argued for rational and ethical egoism ( rational self - interest ) , as the guiding moral principle
she said the individual should exist for his own sake , neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself
rand referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title
she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness , writing in atlas shrugged that , force and mind are opposites
rands political philosophy emphasized individual rights , including property rights
she considered laissez - faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights
which she understood to include many specific forms of government , such as communism , fascism , socialism , theocracy , and the welfare state
her preferred form of government was a constitutional republic that is limited to the protection of individual rights
in aesthetics , rand defined art as a selective re - creation of reality according to an artists metaphysical value - judgments
as a writer , the art form rand focused on most closely was literature
she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will
rands ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy
said she failed in her attempt to solve the is–ought problem
critics from religious traditions oppose her atheism and her rejection of altruism
multiple critics , including nozick , have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails
some critics , like roy childs , have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism , rather than limited government
commentators , including hazel barnes , albert ellis , and nathaniel branden , have criticized rands focus on the importance of reason
branden said this emphasis led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be
except for aristotle , thomas aquinas and classical liberals , rand was sharply critical rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three as—aristotle , aquinas , and ayn rand
in an article for the claremont review of books , political scientist charles murray criticized her claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle
he asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche
there are other indications of nietzsches influence in passages from the first edition of we the living ( which rand later revised ) , loiret - prunet , valerie
ayn rand and feminist synthesis rereading we the living
in sheaffer , robert
rereading rand on gender in the light of paglia
rand considered her philosophical opposite to be immanuel kant , whom she referred to as the most evil man in mankinds history ;
philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences
she was also critical of plato , and viewed his differences with aristotle on questions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy
rands relationship with contemporary philosophers was mostly antagonistic
she was not an academic and did not participate in academic discourse
she was dismissive toward critics and wrote about ideas she disagreed with in a polemical manner without in - depth analysis
she was in turn viewed very negatively by many academic philosophers , who dismissed her as an unimportant figure who need not be given serious consideration
the first reviews rand received were for night of january 16th
reviews of the broadway production were largely positive , but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer
her novella anthem received little review attention , both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re - issues
rands first bestseller , the fountainhead , received far fewer reviews than we the living , and reviewers opinions were mixed
berliner , michael the fountainhead reviews
in was one that rand greatly appreciated
others called the characters unsympathetic and rands style offensively pedestrian
atlas shrugged was widely reviewed , and many of the reviews were strongly negative
atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications , but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put - downs , with reviews including comments that it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity
historian jennifer burns describes the review as a break between buckleys religious conservatism and non - religious libertarianism
rands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels
the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book , for the new intellectual , was similar to that for atlas shrugged
and author gore vidal called her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality
her subsequent books got progressively less review attention
with over 30million copies sold
by 2020 , the total for aris free distribution programs had increased to 4million
a survey conducted for the library of congress and the book - of - the - month club in 1991 asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives
rands atlas shrugged was the second most popular choice , after the bible
rands contemporary admirers included fellow novelists , like ira levin , kay nolte smith and neil smith ; she has influenced later writers like erika holzer , terry goodkind , rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work
television shows , movies , and video games have referred to rand and her works
throughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines , and trinity foundation president john robbins
including mary gaitskill , matt ruff , kay nolte smith , and tobias wolff
two movies have been made about rands life
a 1997 documentary film , ayn rand a sense of life , was nominated for the academy award for best documentary feature
rands image also appears on a 1999 postage stamp illustrated by artist nick gaetano
rands works , most commonly anthem or the fountainhead , are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading
an introduction to the study of ayn rand
in the institute had distributed 4million copies in the and canada by the end of 2020
in 2017 , rand was added to the required reading list for the a level politics exam in the united kingdom
although she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian , rand has had a continuing influence on right - wing politics and libertarianism
rand is often considered one of the three most important women ( along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson ) in the early development of modern american libertarianism
david nolan , one founder of the libertarian party , said that without ayn rand , the libertarian movement would not exist
historian jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right
the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives ( often members of the republican party ) , she faced intense opposition from william buckley jr
and other contributors to the conservative national review magazine , which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas
republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels
the financial crisis of 2007–2008 spurred renewed interest in her works , especially atlas shrugged , which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis
opinion articles compared real - world events with the novels plot
signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests
in 2015 , adam weiner said that through greenspan , rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the us economy
in 2021 , cass sunstein said rands ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the trump administration , which he attributed to the enduring influence of rands fiction
during rands lifetime , her work received little attention from academic scholars
however , as of that same year , few universities included rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area , with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study
but nobody in the academe pays any attention to her , neither as an author nor a philosopher
but he believed more academic critics were engaging with her work in recent years
in 1967 , john hospers discussed rands ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook , an introduction to philosophical analysis
that same year , hazel barnes included a chapter critiquing objectivism in her book an existentialist ethics
a few articles about rands ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982 , many of them in the personalist
other philosophers , writing in the same publication , argued that nozick misstated rands case
the philosophic thought of ayn rand , a 1984 collection of essays about objectivism edited by den uyl and rasmussen , was the first academic book about rands ideas published after her death
in 1987 , the ayn rand society was founded as an affiliate of the american philosophical association
in a 1995 entry about rand in contemporary women philosophers , jenny heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed rand
she said that rands philosophy is regularly omitted from academic philosophy
yet , throughout literary academia , ayn rand is considered a philosopher
the journal of ayn rand studies , a multidisciplinary , peer - reviewed academic journal devoted to the study of rand and her ideas , was established in 1999
in a 2010 essay for the cato institute , huemer argued very few people find rands ideas convincing , especially her ethics
he attributed the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer , especially as a novelist , noting that atlas shrugged outsells rands non - fiction works and the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism
and the university of pittsburgh press launched an ayn rand society philosophical studies series based on the societys proceedings
that same year , political scientist alan wolfe dismissed rand as a nonperson among academics , an attitude that writer ben murnane later described as the traditional academic view of rand
academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited than the discussion of her philosophy
mimi reisel gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about rands novels when she began researching her in 1973 , and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s
although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s
in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in 2001 , john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation
after the closure of the nathaniel branden institute , the objectivist movement continued in other forms in the 1970s , peikoff began delivering courses on objectivism

the country is the largest country by total area in africa and in the arab world , and is bordered to the northeast by tunisia ; to the east by libya ; to the southeast by niger ; to the southwest by mali , mauritania , and western sahara ; to the west by morocco ; and to the north by the mediterranean sea
it has a semi - arid geography , with most of the population living in the fertile north and the sahara dominating the geography of the south
algeria covers an area of with a population of 44 million , algeria is the ninth - most populous country in africa , and the 32nd - most populous country in the world
the capital and largest city is algiers , located in the far north on the mediterranean coast
pre - 1962 algeria has seen many empires and dynasties , including ancient numidians , phoenicians , carthaginians , romans , vandals , byzantines , umayyads , abbasids , rustamids , idrisids , aghlabids , fatimids , zirids , hammadids , almoravids , almohads , zayyanids , spaniards , ottomans and finally , the french colonial empire
the vast majority of algerias population is arab - berber , practicing islam , and using the official languages of arabic and berber
however , french serves as an administrative and educational language in some contexts
the main spoken language is algerian arabic
algeria is a semi - presidential republic , with local constituencies consisting of 58 provinces and 1 , 541 communes
algeria is a regional power in north africa , and a middle power in global affairs
it has the highest human development index of all non - island african countries and one of the largest economies on the continent , based largely on energy exports
algeria has the worlds sixteenth - largest oil reserves and the ninth - largest reserves of natural gas

around 1 - million - year - old stone artifacts from ain hanech ( algeria ) were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in north africa
stone artifacts and cut - marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at ain boucherit are estimated to be 1 million years old , and even older stone artifacts to be as old as 2 million years
hence , the ain boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the mediterranean fringe in northern africa much earlier than previously thought
the evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from east africa or a possible multiple - origin scenario of stone technology in both east and north africa
neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles ( 43 , 000 bc ) similar to those in the levant
algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques
tools of this era , starting about 30 , 000 bc , are called aterian ( after the archaeological site of bir el ater , south of tebessa )
the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian ( located mainly in the oran region )
this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between 15 , 000 and 10 , 000 bc
neolithic civilization ( animal domestication and agriculture ) developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as 11 , 000 bc
from their principal center of power at carthage , the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast ; by 600 bc , a phoenician presence existed at tipasa , east of cherchell , hippo regius ( modern annaba ) and rusicade ( modern skikda )
these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages
as carthaginian power grew , its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically
berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture , manufacturing , trade , and political organisation supported several states
trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew , but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others
by the early 4th century bc , berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army
in the revolt of the mercenaries , berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war
in 146 bc the city of carthage was destroyed
as carthaginian power waned , the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew
by the 2nd century bc , several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged
two of them were established in numidia , behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage
west of numidia lay mauretania , which extended across the moulouya river in modern - day morocco to the atlantic ocean
the high point of berber civilisation , unequalled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later , was reached during the reign of masinissa in the 2nd century bc
after masinissas death in 148 bc , the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times
masinissas line survived until 24 ad , when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire
for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans , who founded many colonies in the region
like the rest of north africa , algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire , exporting cereals and other agricultural products
saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius ( modern - day annaba , algeria ) , located in the roman province of africa
the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in 429 , and by 435 controlled coastal numidia
in fact , by the time the byzantines arrived leptis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous laguatan who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political , military and cultural revival
the collapse of the western roman empire led to the establishment of a native kingdom based in altava ( modern day algeria ) known as the mauro - roman kingdom
it was succeeded by another kingdom based in altava , the kingdom of altava
during the reign of kusaila its territory extended from the region of modern - day fez in the west to the western aurès and later kairaouan and the interior of ifriqiya in the east

jonathan conant , staying roman , 2012 , pp
364–365 after the fall of the umayyad caliphate , numerous local dynasties emerged , including the rustamids , aghlabids , fatimids , zirids , hammadids , almoravids , almohads and the abdalwadid
the christians left in three waves after the initial conquest , in the 10th century and the 11th
the last were evacuated to sicily by the normans and the few remaining died out in the 14th century
during the middle ages , north africa was home to many great scholars , saints and sovereigns including judah ibn quraysh , the first grammarian to mention semitic and berber languages , the great sufi masters sidi boumediene ( abu madyan ) and sidi el houari , and the emirs abd al mumin and yāghmūrasen
it was during this time that the fatimids or children of fatima , daughter of muhammad , came to the maghreb
these fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb , hejaz and the levant , boasting a secular inner government , as well as a powerful army and navy , made up primarily of arabs and levantines extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo
the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded
in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them
the resultant war is recounted in the epic tāghribāt
in al - tāghrībāt the amazigh zirid hero khālīfā al - zānatī asks daily , for duels , to defeat the hilalan hero ābu zayd al - hilalī and many other arab knights in a string of victories
the zirids , however , were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture
the indigenous amazigh tribes , however , remained largely independent , and depending on tribe , location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb , at times unifying it ( as under the fatimids )
the fatimid islamic state , also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa , sicily , palestine , jordan , lebanon , syria , egypt , the red sea coast of africa , tihamah , hejaz and yemen
caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time , as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era
the amazighs historically consisted of several tribes
the two main branches were the botr and barnès tribes , who were divided into tribes , and again into sub - tribes
each region of the maghreb contained several tribes ( for example , sanhadja , houara , zenata , masmouda , kutama , awarba , and berghwata )
all these tribes made independent territorial decisions
several amazigh dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands
ibn khaldun provides a table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region , the zirid , ifranid , maghrawa , almoravid , hammadid , almohad , merinid , abdalwadid , wattasid , meknassa and hafsid dynasties
the fatimids which was created and established by the kutama berbers conquered all of north africa as well as sicily and parts of the middle east
following the berber revolt numerous independent states emerged across the maghreb
in algeria the rustamid kingdom was established
the rustamid realm stretched from tafilalt in morocco to the nafusa mountains in libya including south , central and western tunisia therefore including territory in all of the modern day maghreb countries , in the south the rustamid realm expanded to the modern borders of mali and included territory in mauritania

as the fatimid state was at the time too weak to attempt a direct invasion , they found another means of revenge
between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin nomad tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulency
the banu hilal and the banu sulaym for example , who regularly disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot their farms the then fatimid vizier decided to destroy what he couldnt control , and broke a deal with the chiefs of these beduouin tribes
the fatimids even gave them money to leave
whole tribes set off with women , children , elders , animals and camping equipment
some stopped on the way , especially in cyrenaica , where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the gabes region , arriving 1051
the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide , but with each encounter , the last under the walls of kairouan , his troops were defeated and the arabs remained masters of the battlefield
they arabs usually didnt take control over the cities , instead looting them and destroying them
the invasion kept going , and in 1057 the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine where they encircled the qalaa of banu hammad ( capital of the hammadid emirate ) , as they had done in kairouan a few decades ago
from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains
some of these territories were forcibly taken back by the almohads in the second half of the 12th century
the influx of bedouin tribes was a major factor in the linguistic , cultural arabization of the maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant
the almohads originating from modern day morocco , although founded by a man originating from algeria known as abd al - mumin would soon take control over the maghreb
during the time of the almohad dynasty abd al - mumins tribe , the koumïa , were the main supporters of the throne and the most important body of the empire

the zayyanids retained their control over algeria for 3 centuries
much of the eastern territories of algeria were under the authority of the hafsid dynasty , although the emirate of bejaia encompassing the algerian territories of the hafsids would occasionally be independent from central tunisian control
at their peak the zayyanid kingdom included all of morocco as its vassal to the west and in the east reached as far as tunis which they captured during the reign of abu tashfin

following their decisive victories over the algerians in the western - coastal areas of algeria , the spanish decided to get bolder , and invaded more algerian cities
in 1510 , they led a series of sieges and attacks , taking over bejaia in a large siege , and jijel , and attacked mostaganem where although they werent able to conquer the city , they were able to force a tribute on them
in 1516 , the ottoman privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa , who operated successfully under the hafsids , moved their base of operations to algiers
they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the christians , but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble salim al - tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions
when aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of tlemcen , hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers
the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2 , 000 janissaries
with the aid of this force and native algerians , hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran ( although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until 1792 )
the next beylerbey was hayreddins son hasan , who assumed the position in 1544
he was a kouloughli or of mixed origins , as his mother was an algerian mooresse
until 1587 beylerbeylik of algiers was governed by beylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits
subsequently , with the institution of a regular administration , governors with the title of pasha ruled for three - year terms the pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit , known in algeria as the ojaq who were led by an agha
discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid - 1600s because they were not paid regularly , and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha
as a result , the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659
plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa
algiers lost from 30 , 000 to 50 , 000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21 , and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57 , 1665 , 1691 and 1740–42
the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other non - islamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea
the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slaves
they often made raids on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and other parts of the ottoman empire
in 1551 , the ottoman governor of algiers , turgut reis , enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo
barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands
the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera
in july 1627 two pirate ships from algiers under the command of dutch pirate jan janszoon sailed as far as iceland , two weeks earlier another pirate ship from salé in morocco had also raided in iceland
some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland , but some chose to stay in algeria
in 1629 , pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islands
in 1671 , the taifa of raises , or the company of corsair captains rebelled , killed the agha , and placed one of its own in power
the new leader received the title of dey
after 1689 , the right to select the dey passed to the divan , a council of some sixty nobles
it was at first dominated by the ojaq ; but by the 18th century , it had become the deys instrument
in 1710 , the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent , replacing the pasha in that role
although algiers remained nominally part of the ottoman empire , in reality they acted independently from the rest of the empire , and often had wars with other ottoman subjects and territories such as the beylik of tunis
the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat
the dey was elected for a life term , but in the 159 years ( 1671–1830 ) that the system was in place , fourteen of the twenty - nine deys were assassinated
despite usurpation , military coups and occasional mob rule , the day - to - day operation of the deylikal government was remarkably orderly
although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains , it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside , where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest
autonomous tribal states were tolerated , and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the kabylia , many cities in the northern parts of the algerian desert paid taxes to algiers or one of its beys , although they otherwise retained complete autonomy from central control , while the deeper parts of the sahara were completely independent from algiers
barbary raids in the mediterranean continued to attack spanish merchant shipping , and as a result , the spanish navy bombarded algiers in 1783 and 1784
in 1792 , algiers took back oran and mers el kébir , the two last spanish strongholds in algeria
in the same year , they conquered the moroccan rif and oujda , which they then abandoned in 1795
in the 19th century , algerian pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers , paying a licence tax in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels
attacks by algerian pirates on american merchantmen resulted in the first and second barbary wars , which ended the attacks on ships
a year later , a combined anglo - dutch fleet , under the command of lord exmouth bombarded algiers to stop similar attacks on european fishermen
these efforts proved successful , although algerian piracy would continue until the french conquest in 1830
under the pretext of a slight to their consul , the french invaded and captured algiers in 1830
historian ben kiernan wrote on the french conquest of algeria by 1875 , the french conquest was complete
the war had killed approximately 825 , 000 indigenous algerians since 1830
the population of algeria , which stood at about 2 million in 1872 , reached nearly 11 million in 1960
on 17 september 1860 , napoleon iii declared our first duty is to take care of the happiness of the three million arabs , whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination
from 1848 until independence , france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and département of the nation
one of frances longest - held overseas territories , algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants , who became known as colons and later , as pied - noirs
between 1825 and 1847 , 50 , 000 french people emigrated to algeria
many europeans settled in oran and algiers , and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities
during the late 19th and early 20th century , the european share was almost a fifth of the population
the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france , and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900
the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency , but in contrast to the other colonised countries path in central asia and caucasus , algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human - capital intensive agriculture
during the second world war , algeria came under vichy control before being liberated by the allies in operation torch , which saw the first large - scale deployment of american troops in the north african campaign
gradually , dissatisfaction among the muslim population , which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system , gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france
in may 1945 , the uprising against the occupying french forces was suppressed through what is now known as the sétif and guelma massacre
tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 , when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began after the publication of the declaration of 1 november 1954
historians have estimated that between 30 , 000 and 150 , 000 harkis and their dependants were killed by the front de libération nationale ( fln ) or by lynch mobs in algeria
the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war , and the french conducted severe reprisals
the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries
historians , like alistair horne and raymond aron , state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the 1million deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence
horne estimated algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700 , 000
the war against french rule concluded in 1962 , when algeria gained complete independence following the march 1962 evian agreements and the july 1962 self - determination referendum
the number of european pied - noirs who fled algeria totaled more than 900 , 000 between 1962 and 1964
the exodus to mainland france accelerated after the oran massacre of 1962 , in which hundreds of militants entered european sections of the city , and began attacking civilians
algerias first president was the front de libération nationale ( fln ) leader ahmed ben bella
moroccos claim to portions of western algeria led to the sand war in 1963
ben bella was overthrown in 1965 by houari boumédiène , his former ally and defence minister
under ben bella , the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian ; boumédienne continued this trend
but , he relied much more on the army for his support , and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role
he collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive
oil extraction facilities were nationalised
this was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisis
in the 1960s and 1970s under president houari boumediene , algeria pursued a program of industrialisation within a state - controlled socialist economy
boumedienes successor , chadli bendjedid , introduced some liberal economic reforms he promoted a policy of arabisation in algerian society and public life
teachers of arabic , brought in from other muslim countries , spread conventional islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to orthodox islam
the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil , leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut
economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in algerian social unrest during the 1980s ; by the end of the decade , bendjedid introduced a multi - party system
political parties developed , such as the islamic salvation front ( fis ) , a broad coalition of muslim groups
in december 1991 the islamic salvation front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections
fearing the election of an islamist government , the authorities intervened on 11 january 1992 , cancelling the elections
bendjedid resigned and a high council of state was installed to act as the presidency
it banned the fis , triggering a civil insurgency between the fronts armed wing , the armed islamic group , and the national armed forces , in which more than 100 , 000 people are thought to have died
the islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres
at several points in the conflict , the situation in algeria became a point of international concern , most notably during the crisis surrounding air france flight 8969 , a hijacking perpetrated by the armed islamic group
the armed islamic group declared a ceasefire in october 1997
algeria held elections in 1999 , considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by president abdelaziz bouteflika
he worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a civil concord initiative , approved in a referendum , under which many political prisoners were pardoned , and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty , in force until 13 january 2000
the ais disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly
the groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat ( gspc ) , a splinter group of the armed islamic group , continued a terrorist campaign against the government
bouteflika was re - elected in the april 2004 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation
the programme comprised economic , institutional , political and social reform to modernise the country , raise living standards , and tackle the causes of alienation
it also included a second amnesty initiative , the charter for peace and national reconciliation , which was approved in a referendum in september 2005
it offered amnesty to most guerrillas and government security forces
in november 2008 , the algerian constitution was amended following a vote in parliament , removing the two - term limit on presidential incumbents
this change enabled bouteflika to stand for re - election in the 2009 presidential elections , and he was re - elected in april 2009
during his election campaign and following his re - election , bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a 150 - billion spending programme to create three million new jobs , the construction of one million new housing units , and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes
a continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 december 2010 , inspired by similar protests across the middle east and north africa
on 24 february 2011 , the government lifted algerias 19 - year - old state of emergency
in april 2011 , bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform
however , elections are routinely criticised by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue
on 2 april 2019 , bouteflika resigned from the presidency after mass protests against his candidacy for a fifth term in office
in december 2019 , abdelmadjid tebboune became algerias president , after winning the first round of the presidential election with a record abstention rate – the highest of all presidential elections since algerias democracy in 1989

since the 2011 breakup of sudan , and the creation of south sudan , algeria has been the largest country in africa , and the mediterranean basin
its southern part includes a significant portion of the sahara
to the north , the tell atlas form with the saharan atlas , further south , two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound , and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands
both atlas tend to merge in eastern algeria
the vast mountain ranges of aures and nememcha occupy the entire northeastern algeria and are delineated by the tunisian border
the highest point is mount tahat
algeria lies mostly between latitudes 19° and 37°n ( a small area is north of 37°n and south of 19°n ) , and longitudes 9°w and 12°e
most of the coastal area is hilly , sometimes even mountainous , and there are a few natural harbours
the area from the coast to the tell atlas is fertile
south of the tell atlas is a steppe landscape ending with the saharan atlas ; farther south , there is the sahara desert
the hoggar mountains ( south of the capital , algiers , and just east of tamanghasset
algiers , oran , constantine , and annaba are algerias main cities
in this region , midday desert temperatures can be hot year round
after sunset , however , the clear , dry air permits rapid loss of heat , and the nights are cool to chilly
enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded
rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the tell atlas , ranging from in some years
farther inland , the rainfall is less plentiful
algeria also has ergs , or sand dunes , between mountains
among these , in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty , temperatures can go up to

the grape vine is indigenous to the coast
in the sahara region , some oases have palm trees
acacias with wild olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the sahara

camels are used extensively ; the desert also abounds with venomous and nonvenomous snakes , scorpions , and numerous insects
elected politicians have relatively little sway over algeria
instead , a group of unelected civilian and military décideurs ( deciders ) , known as le pouvoir ( the power ) , actually rule the country , even deciding who should be president
the most powerful man might have been mohamed mediène , the head of military intelligence , before he was brought down during the 2019 protests
the head of state is the president of algeria , who is elected for a five - year term
the president was formerly limited to two five - year terms , but a constitutional amendment passed by the parliament on 11 november 2008 removed this limitation

in 2009 , the french government agreed to compensate victims of nuclear tests in algeria
defence minister herve morin stated that its time for our country to be at peace with itself , at peace thanks to a system of compensation and reparations , when presenting the draft law on the payouts
algerian officials and activists believe that this is a good first step and hope that this move would encourage broader reparation
tensions between algeria and morocco in relation to the western sahara have been an obstacle to tightening the arab maghreb union , nominally established in 1989 , but which has carried little practical weight

algerias currency is the dinar ( dzd )
the economy remains dominated by the state , a legacy of the countrys socialist post - independence development model
in recent years , the algerian government has halted the privatization of state - owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy
these restrictions are just starting to be lifted off recently although questions about algerias slowly - diversifying economy remain
algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy
the governments efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages
the country is facing a number of short - term and medium - term problems , including the need to diversify the economy , strengthen political , economic and financial reforms , improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions
a wave of economic protests in february and march 2011 prompted the algerian government to offer more than 23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases
public spending has increased by 27 annually during the past 5 years
the 2010–14 public - investment programme will cost us286 billion , 40 of which will go to human development
thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues , algeria has a cushion of 173 billion in foreign currency reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilisation fund
in addition , algerias external debt is extremely low at about 2 of gdp
the economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth , and , despite high foreign exchange reserves ( us178 billion , equivalent to three years of imports ) , current expenditure growth makes algerias budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues
algeria has not joined the wto , despite several years of negotiations but is a member of the greater arab free trade area and has an association agreement with the european union
turkish direct investments have accelerated in algeria , with total value reaching 5 billion

of export earnings
algeria has the 10th - largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the sixth - largest gas exporter
the energy information administration reported that in 2005 , algeria had it also ranks 16th in oil reserves
non - hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5
to cope with social demands , the authorities raised expenditure , especially on basic food support , employment creation , support for smes , and higher salaries
high hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position
income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices , though the trend in production volume is downwards
production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume , continues to decline , dropping from 43 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011
nevertheless , the sector accounted for 98 of the total volume of exports in 2011 , against 48 in 1962 , and 70 of budgetary receipts , or us71 billion
the algerian national oil company is sonatrach , which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in algeria
all foreign operators must work in partnership with sonatrach , which usually has majority ownership in production - sharing agreements
access to biocapacity in algeria is lower than world average
in 2016 , algeria had 0 global hectares in 2016 , algeria used 2 global hectares of biocapacity per person – their ecological footprint of consumption
this means they use just under 4 times as much biocapacity as algeria contains
as a result , algeria is running a biocapacity deficit
in april 2022 , diplomats from italy and spain held talks after rome’s move to secure large volume of algerian gas stoked concerns in madrid
algeria has invested an estimated 100 billion dinars towards developing research facilities and paying researchers

despite the dominance of the berber ethnicity in algeria , the majority of algerians identify with an arabic - based identity , especially after the arab nationalism rising in the 20th century
unreliable sourcesureyreasonthe encyclopedia doesnt show a source or a statistical effort for the claim that the overwhelming majority of population is bebrer
this claim is widely controversial and should be sourced from a serious place with actual studies
modern standard arabic and berber are the official languages

following a period during which the algerian government tried to phase out french , in recent decades the government has changed course and reinforced the study of french , and some television programs are broadcast in the language
algeria emerged as a bilingual state after 1962
colloquial algerian arabic is spoken by about 72 of the population and berber by 27–30

the following are major characters from the novel
refngroupnotecharacters in this article are listed as major if they meet one of the following criteria
dagny taggart is the protagonist of the novel
she is vice - president in charge of operations for taggart transcontinental , under her brother , james taggart
given james incompetence , dagny is responsible for all the workings of the railroad
francisco danconia is one of the central characters in atlas shrugged , an owner by inheritance of the worlds largest copper mining operation
he is a childhood friend , and the first love , of dagny taggart
a child prodigy of exceptional talents , francisco was dubbed the climax of the danconia line , an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists
he was a classmate of john galt and ragnar danneskjöld and student of both hugh akston and robert stadler
he began working while still in school , proving that he could have made a fortune without the aid of his familys wealth and power
later , francisco bankrupts the danconia business to put it out of others reach
his full name is given as francisco domingo carlos andres sebastián danconia
john galt is the primary male hero of atlas shrugged
he initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for taggart transcontinental , who often dines with eddie willers in the employees cafeteria , and leads eddie to reveal important information about dagny taggart and taggart transcontinental
only eddies side of their conversations is given in the novel
later in the novel , the reader discovers this workers true identity
before working for taggart transcontinental , galt worked as an engineer for the twentieth century motor company , where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity , but abandoned his prototype , and his employment , when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment
this prototype was found by dagny taggart and hank rearden
galt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel , working a job and living by himself , where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership
much of the books third division is given to his broadcast speech , which presents the authors philosophy of objectivism
henry ( known as hank ) rearden is one of the central characters in atlas shrugged
he owns the most important steel company in the united states , and invents rearden metal , an alloy stronger , lighter , cheaper and tougher than steel
he lives in philadelphia with his wife lillian , his brother philip , and his elderly mother
rearden represents a type of self - made man and eventually divorces lillian , abandons his steel mills following a bloody assault by government - planted workers , and joins john galts strike
edwin eddie willers is the special assistant to the vice - president in charge of operations at taggart transcontinental
his father and grandfather worked for the taggarts , and himself likewise
he is completely loyal to dagny and to taggart transcontinental
willers does not possess the creative ability of galts associates , but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations
after dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive galt , willers maintains the railroad until its collapse
one of galts first followers , and world - famous as a pirate , who seizes relief ships sent from the united states to the peoples states of europe
he works to ensure that once those espousing galts philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society , they have enough capital to rebuild the world
kept in the background for much of the book , danneskjöld makes a personal appearance to encourage rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation , and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years
danneskjöld is married to the actress kay ludlow ; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world , which only knows of ludlow as a retired film star
considered a misfit by galts other adherents , he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding galts perspective
according to barbara branden , who was closely associated with rand at the time the book was written , there were sections written describing danneskjölds adventures at sea , cut from the final published text
, wherein the hero becomes the first of the counts of danneskjöld
in the published book , danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others ( dagny taggart or hank rearden ) , except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter
the president of taggart transcontinental and the books most important antagonist
taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own
he relies on his sister , dagny taggart , to actually run the railroad , but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti - capitalist moral and political beliefs
in a sense , he is the antithesis of dagny
this contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends , and the horror that he will succeed at this
in the final chapters of the novel , he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect
the unsupportive wife of hank rearden , who dislikes his habits and ( secretly at first ) seeks to ruin rearden to prove her own value
lillian achieves this , when she passes information to james taggart about her husbands affair with his sister
this information is used to blackmail rearden to sign a gift certificate which delivers all the property rights of rearden metal to others
lillian thereafter uses james taggart for sexual satisfaction , until hank abandons her
ferris is a biologist who works as co - ordinator at the state science institute
he uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement , and publishes a book entitled why do you think you think he clashes on several occasions with hank rearden , and twice attempts to blackmail rearden into giving up rearden metal
he is also one of the group of looters who tries to get rearden to agree to the steel unification plan
ferris hosts the demonstration of the project x weapon , and is the creator of the ferris persuader , a torture machine
when john galt is captured by the looters , ferris uses the device on galt , but it breaks down before extracting the information ferris wants from galt
ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters
a former professor at patrick henry university , and along with colleague hugh akston , mentor to francisco danconia , john galt and ragnar danneskjöld
he has since become a sell - out , one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval , to the detriment of the free
he works at the state science institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military , including a sound - based weapon known as project x ( xylophone )
he is killed when cuffy meigs ( see below ) drunkenly overloads the circuits of project x , causing it to destroy itself and every structure and living thing in a 100 - mile radius
the character was , in part , modeled on robert oppenheimer , whom rand had interviewed for an earlier project , and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons
to his former student galt , stadler represents the epitome of human evil , as the man who knew better but chose not to act for the good
the incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom hank rearden reluctantly employs in washington , who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty
in return for betraying hank by helping broker the equalization of opportunity bill ( which , by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one , forces hank to divest most of his companies ) , he is given a senior position at the bureau of economic planning and national resources
later in the novel he becomes its top co - ordinator , a position that eventually becomes economic dictator of the country
mouchs mantra , whenever a problem arises from his prior policy , is to say , i cant help it

anthropology is the scientific study of humanity , concerned with human behavior , human biology , cultures , societies , and linguistics , in both the present and past , including past human species
department of anthropologyurlhttps / / anthropology
edu / graduate - program / programs - and - concentrations / sociocultural - anthropology - and - ethnography / access - date2021 - 09 - 25languageen - us is commonly used today
linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life
biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans
archaeological anthropology , often termed as anthropology of the past , studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence
it is considered a branch of anthropology in north america and asia , while in europe archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines , such as history
the abstract noun anthropology is first attested in reference to history
their new latin , by the early 18th century
anthropology , that is to say the science that treats of man , is divided ordinarily and with reason into anatomy , which considers the body and the parts , and psychology , which speaks of the soul
sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently , such as the use by étienne serres in 1839 to describe the natural history , or paleontology , of man , based on comparative anatomy , and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the french national museum of natural history by jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau
various short - lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed
the société ethnologique de paris , the first to use the term ethnology , was formed in 1839
its members were primarily anti - slavery activists
when slavery was abolished in france in 1848 , the société was abandoned
meanwhile , the ethnological society of new york , currently the american ethnological society , was founded on its model in 1842 , as well as the ethnological society of london in 1843 , a break - away group of the aborigines protection society
anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century
theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy , linguistics , and ethnology , making feature - by - feature comparisons of their subject matters , were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals , languages , and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then
for them , the publication of charles darwins on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect
darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild
darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s
there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences
paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies , the société danthropologie de paris , meeting for the first time in paris in 1859
his definition now became the study of the human group , considered as a whole , in its details , and in relation to the rest of nature
broca , being what today would be called a neurosurgeon , had taken an interest in the pathology of speech
he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals , which appeared to reside in speech
he discovered the speech center of the human brain , today called brocas area after him
his interest was mainly in biological anthropology , but a german philosopher specializing in psychology , theodor waitz , took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six - volume work , entitled die anthropologie der naturvölker , 1859–1864
the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples
the last two volumes were published posthumously
waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man
following brocas lead , waitz points out that anthropology is a new field , which would gather material from other fields , but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy , physiology , and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him
he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical , gathered by experimentation
waitz was influential among british ethnologists
in 1863 , the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london , which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology
it was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence
representatives from the french société were present , though not broca
in his keynote address , printed in the first volume of its new publication , the anthropological review , hunt stressed the work of waitz , adopting his definitions as a standard
among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor , inventor of cultural anthropology , and his brother alfred tylor , a geologist
previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist ; subsequently , an anthropologist
similar organizations in other countries followed the anthropological society of madrid ( 1865 ) , the american anthropological association in 1902 , the anthropological society of vienna ( 1870 ) , the italian society of anthropology and ethnology ( 1871 ) , and many others subsequently
the majority of these were evolutionists
one notable exception was the berlin society for anthropology , ethnology , and prehistory ( 1869 ) founded by rudolph virchow , known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists
not religious himself , he insisted that darwins conclusions lacked empirical foundation
during the last three decades of the 19th century , a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred , most independent , most publishing their own journals , and all international in membership and association
the major theorists belonged to these organizations
they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning
by 1898 , 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology
none of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology
this meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the worlds higher educational institutions , many thousands in number
anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more
practical anthropology , the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems , has arrived ; for example , the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene
the organization has reached a global level
for example , the world council of anthropological associations ( wcaa ) , a network of national , regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology , currently contains members from about three dozen nations
since the work of franz boas and bronisław malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on cross - cultural comparisons , long - term in - depth examination of context , and the importance they place on participant - observation or experiential immersion in the area of research
cultural anthropology , in particular , has emphasized cultural relativism , holism , and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques
hylland eriksen , thomas
( 2004 ) what is anthropology pluto
in great britain and the commonwealth countries , the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate
in the united states , anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early 20th century biological or physical anthropology ; social , cultural , or sociocultural anthropology ; and archaeological anthropology ; plus linguistic anthropology
these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques
european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology ( a term coined and defined by adam kollár in 1783 )
it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition
anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities , social sciences and natural sciences
anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences , including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens , human physical traits , human behavior , the variations among different groups of humans , how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture , and from social sciences , including the organization of human social and cultural relations , institutions , social conflicts , etcetera early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity , such as by al - biruni of the islamic golden age
understanding other religions al - birunis and gadamers fusion of horizons
by kemal ataman page 59 as such , anthropology has been central in the development of several new ( late 20th century ) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science , global studies , and various ethnic studies
sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories , as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies
during the 1970s and 1990s , there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline
during this shift , enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology
in contrast , archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist
due to this difference in epistemology , the four sub - fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades
sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology
cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them , while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among individuals and groups
cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy , literature and the arts ( how ones culture affects the experience for self and group , contributing to a more complete understanding of the peoples knowledge , customs , and institutions ) , while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history
in that , it helps develop an understanding of social structures , typically of others and other populations ( such as minorities , subgroups , dissidents , etcetera )
there is no hard - and - fast distinction between them , and these categories overlap to a considerable degree
inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism , the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values
this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography
ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research , that is an ethnographic monograph
as a methodology , ethnography is based upon long - term fieldwork within a community or other research site
participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology
ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures
the process of participant - observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic ( conceptual , vs
etic , or technical ) point of view
the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology , as kinship is a human universal
sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization , law and conflict resolution , patterns of consumption and exchange , material culture , technology , infrastructure , gender relations , ethnicity , childrearing and socialization , religion , myth , symbols , values , etiquette , worldview , sports , music , nutrition , recreation , games , food , festivals , and language ( which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology )
comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology , including the industrialized ( and de - industrialized ) west
the standard cross - cultural sample ( sccs ) includes 186 such cultures
biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non - human primates in their biological , evolutionary , and demographic dimensions
it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates , and that generate , maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation
archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains
artifacts , faunal remains , and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies
archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices
ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups , who are presumed to have lived in similar ways
linguistic anthropology ( not to be confused with anthropological linguistics ) seeks to understand the processes of human communications , verbal and non - verbal , variation in language across time and space , the social uses of language , and the relationship between language and culture
it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems , linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes
linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics , pragmatics , cognitive linguistics , semiotics , discourse analysis , and narrative analysis
ethnography is a method of analysing social or cultural interaction
it often involves participant observation though an ethnographer may also draw from texts written by participants of in social interactions
ethnography views first - hand experience and social context as important
tim ingold distinguishes ethnography from anthropology arguing that anthropology tries to construct general theories of human experience , applicable in general and novel settings , while ethnography concerns itself with fidelity
he argues that the anthropologist must make his writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other theory , but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists and the fields inform one another
one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of art as a cultural phenomenon
several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of painting , sculpture , or literature , conceived as independent artistic activities , do not exist , or exist in a significantly different form , in most non - western contexts
to surmount this difficulty , anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which , without exclusively being artistic , have certain evident aesthetic qualities
boas primitive art , claude lévi - strauss the way of the masks ( 1982 ) or geertzs art as cultural system ( 1983 ) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of art into an anthropology of culturally specific aesthetics
media anthropology ( also known as the anthropology of media or mass media ) emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers , audiences , and other cultural and social aspects of mass media
the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production ( for example , ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers , journalists in the field , film production ) to contexts of media reception , following audiences in their everyday responses to media
other types include cyber anthropology , a relatively new area of internet research , as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media , such as development work , social movements , or health education
this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts , where media such as radio , the press , new media , and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s
ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music ( broadly defined ) , that emphasize its cultural , social , material , cognitive , biological , and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire
ethnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields , such as teaching , politics , cultural anthropology etcetera while the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the 18th and 19th centuries , it was formally introduced as “ethnomusicology” by dutch scholar jaap kunst around 1950
later , the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical ethnomusicology and the society of ethnomusicology
visual anthropology is concerned , in part , with the study and production of ethnographic photography , film and , since the mid - 1990s , new media
while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film , visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation , including areas such as performance , museums , art , and the production and reception of mass media
visual representations from all cultures , such as sandpaintings , tattoos , sculptures and reliefs , cave paintings , scrimshaw , jewelry , hieroglyphics , paintings , and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology
economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic , geographic and cultural scope
it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics , of which it is highly critical
its origins as a sub - field of anthropology begin with the polish - british founder of anthropology , bronisław malinowski , and his french compatriot , marcel mauss , on the nature of gift - giving exchange ( or reciprocity ) as an alternative to market exchange
economic anthropology remains , for the most part , focused upon exchange
the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production , in contrast
economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists , and have now turned to examine corporations , banks , and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective
political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology , including , but not limited to , non - capitalist societies
political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture
three main areas of interest rapidly developed
the first of these areas was concerned with the pre - capitalist societies that were subject to evolutionary tribal stereotypes
sahlins work on hunter - gatherers as the original affluent society did much to dissipate that image
the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the worlds population at the time , the peasantry , many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam
the third area was on colonialism , imperialism , and the creation of the capitalist world - system
more recently , these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial ( and post - industrial ) capitalism around the world
applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems it is a complex of related , research - based , instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data , initiation of direct action , and / or the formulation of policy
more simply , applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research ; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community
it is closely related to development anthropology ( distinct from the more critical anthropology of development )
anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective
the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why , if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty , is poverty increasing why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis in short , why does so much planned development fail
kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures , or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves
over its history , anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms , such as descent , descent groups , lineages , affines , cognates , and even fictive kinship
broadly , kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent ( ones social relations during development ) , and also relatives by marriage
within kinship you have two different families
people have their biological families and it is the people they share dna with
this is called consanguineal relations or blood tieshttp / / content

feminist anthropology is a four field approach to anthropology ( archeological , biological , cultural , linguistic ) that seeks to reduce male bias in research findings , anthropological hiring practices , and the scholarly production of knowledge
anthropology engages often with feminists from non - western traditions , whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white feminists of europe , america , and elsewhere
from the perspective of the western world , historically such peripheral perspectives have been ignored , observed only from an outsider perspective , and regarded as less - valid or less - important than knowledge from the western world
exploring and addressing that double bias against women from marginalized racial or ethnic groups is of particular interest in intersectional feminist anthropology
feminist anthropologists have stated that their publications have contributed to anthropology , along the way correcting against the systemic biases beginning with the patriarchal origins of anthropology ( and ( academia ) and note that from 1891 to 1930 doctorates in anthropology went to males more than 85 , more than 81 were under 35 , and only 7 to anyone over 40 years old , thus reflecting an age gap in the pursuit of anthropology by first - wave feminists until later in life
this correction of systemic bias may include mainstream feminist theory , history , linguistics , archaeology , and anthropology
feminist anthropologists are often concerned with the construction of gender across societies
gender constructs are of particular interest when studying sexism
according to st
clair drake , vera mae green was , until well into the 1960s , the only african - american female anthropologist who was also a caribbeanist
she studied ethnic and family relations in the caribbean as well as the united states , and thereby tried to improve the way black life , experiences , and culture were studied
feminist anthropology is inclusive of the anthropology of birth as a specialization , which is the anthropological study of pregnancy and childbirth within cultures and societies
medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies human health and disease , health care systems , and biocultural adaptation
other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering ( farmer , 1999 , 2003 ; beneduce , 2010 ) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness
on the other hand , there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production , such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry
nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems , nutritional status and food security , and how changes in the former affect the latter
if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food , food security , and dietary health , then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization
nutritional status affects overall health status , work performance potential , and the overall potential for economic development ( either in terms of human development or traditional western models ) for any given group of people
psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes
this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans development and enculturation within a particular cultural group– with its own history , language , practices , and conceptual categories– shape processes of human cognition , emotion , perception , motivation , and mental health
cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge , cultural innovation , and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences ( especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology ) often through close collaboration with historians , ethnographers , archaeologists , linguists , musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them
transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture
as with transpersonal psychology , the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness ( asc ) and transpersonal experience
however , the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross - cultural issues – for instance , the roles of myth , ritual , diet , and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences
political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems , looked at from the basis of the structure of societies
political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies , a new development started from the 1960s , and is still unfolding anthropologists started increasingly to study more complex social settings in which the presence of states , bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena
the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels
firstly , anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state - regulated sphere ( as in patron - client relations or tribal political organization )
secondly , anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions ( and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions )
an anthropology of the state developed , and it is a most thriving field today
geertz comparative work on negara , the balinese state , is an early , famous example
legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in the cross - cultural study of social ordering
and political uprisings
public anthropology was created by robert borofsky , a professor at hawaii pacific university , to demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad , public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change
cyborg anthropology originated as a sub - focus group within the american anthropological associations annual meeting in 1993
the sub - group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science
donna haraways 1985 cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term
cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built , specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings
digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital - era technology , and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect
it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology , and sometimes considered part of material culture
the field is new , and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases
these include techno - anthropology , and virtual anthropology
ecological anthropology is defined as the study of cultural adaptations to environments
the focus of its research concerns how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments , and how their environments change across space and time
the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for / against or creation of policy , and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land
often , the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly ( organizing , participation ) or indirectly ( articles , documentaries , books , ethnographies )
such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park
social sciences , like anthropology , can provide interdisciplinary approaches to the environment
professor kay milton , director of the anthropology research network in the school of history and anthropology , describes anthropology as distinctive , with its most distinguishing feature being its interest in non - industrial indigenous and traditional societies
anthropological theory is distinct because of the consistent presence of the concept of culture ; not an exclusive topic but a central position in the study and a deep concern with the human condition
milton describes three trends that are causing a fundamental shift in what characterizes anthropology dissatisfaction with the cultural relativist perspective , reaction against cartesian dualisms which obstructs progress in theory ( nature culture divide ) , and finally an increased attention to globalization ( transcending the barriers or time / space )
environmental discourse appears to be characterized by a high degree of globalization
( the troubling problem is borrowing non indigenous practices and creating standards , concepts , philosophies and practices in western countries
) anthropology and environmental discourse now have become a distinct position in anthropology as a discipline
knowledge about diversities in human culture can be important in addressing environmental problems - anthropology is now a study of human ecology
human activity is the most important agent in creating environmental change , a study commonly found in human ecology which can claim a central place in how environmental problems are examined and addressed
other ways anthropology contributes to environmental discourse is by being theorists and analysts , or by refinement of definitions to become more neutral / universal , etcetera in exploring environmentalism - the term typically refers to a concern that the environment should be protected , particularly from the harmful effects of human activities
environmentalism itself can be expressed in many ways
anthropologists can open the doors of environmentalism by looking beyond industrial society , understanding the opposition between industrial and non industrial relationships , knowing what ecosystem people and biosphere people are and are affected by , dependent and independent variables , “primitive” ecological wisdom , diverse environments , resource management , diverse cultural traditions , and knowing that environmentalism is a part of culture
ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records
it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today
ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation
its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts
practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps , music , paintings , photography , folklore , oral tradition , site exploration , archaeological materials , museum collections , enduring customs , language , and place names
the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions , and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures

urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization , poverty , and neoliberalism
ulf hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were a notoriously agoraphobic lot , anti - urban by definition
various social processes in the western world as well as in the third world ( the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists ) brought the attention of specialists in other cultures closer to their homes
there are two main approaches to urban anthropology examining the types of cities or examining the social issues within the cities
these two methods are overlapping and dependent of each other
by defining different types of cities , one would use social factors as well as economic and political factors to categorize the cities
by directly looking at the different social issues , one would also be studying how they affect the dynamic of the city
anthrozoology ( also known as human–animal studies ) is the study of interaction between living things
it is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines , including anthropology , ethology , medicine , psychology , veterinary medicine and zoology
a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human - animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions
it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields , including anthropology , sociology , biology , and philosophy
biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture
physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective ; that is , from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences
after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology
evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non - hominin primates
evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science , combining the human development with socioeconomic factors
evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans , past and present
it is based on a scientific approach , and brings together fields such as archaeology , behavioral ecology , psychology , primatology , and genetics
it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field , drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience , past and present
forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting , most often in criminal cases where the victims remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition
a forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed , burned , mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable
the adjective forensic refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law
paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology
it is the study of ancient humans , as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints
genetics and morphology of specimens are crucially important to this field
contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges
the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association ( aaa ) , which was founded in 1903
in 1989 , a group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists ( easa ) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe
the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology
hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub - fields of anthropology , sometimes divided up by nation or region , and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines , such as geology , physics , zoology , paleontology , anatomy , music theory , art history , sociology and so on , belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well
as the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves , and professional societies have generated codes of ethics
anthropologists , like other researchers ( especially historians and scientists engaged in field research ) , have over time assisted state policies and projects , especially colonialism
asad , talal , ed

atlantic highlands , nj humanities press
as part of their quest for scientific objectivity , present - day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism , which has an influence on all the sub - fields of anthropology
this is the notion that cultures should not be judged by anothers values or viewpoints , but be examined dispassionately on their own terms there should be no notions , in good anthropology , of one culture being better or worse than another culture
ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide , infanticide , racism , sexism , mutilation ( including circumcision and subincision ) , and torture
topics like racism , slavery , and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies , to genes , to acculturation , to colonialism , have been proposed to explain their origins and continued recurrences
to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach , one can take just one of these topics , such as racism and find thousands of anthropological references , stretching across all the major and minor sub - fields
anthropologists involvement with the government , in particular , has caused bitter controversy within the discipline
franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i , and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists
but by the 1940s , many of boas anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis powers ( nazi germany , fascist italy , and imperial japan )
many served in the armed forces , while others worked in intelligence ( for example , office of strategic services and the office of war information )
at the same time , david prices work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies
attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up surprisingly little
many anthropologists ( students and teachers ) were active in the antiwar movement
numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association ( aaa )
professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state
their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings
the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth ( asa ) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous
the principles of professional responsibility issued by the american anthropological association and amended through november 1986 stated that in relation with their own government and with host governments no secret research , no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given
anthropologists , along with other social scientists , are working with the us military as part of the us armys strategy in afghanistan
in 2009 , the american anthropological associations commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding , in part , that , when ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions , not subject to external review , where data collection occurs in the context of war , integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency , and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology
in summary , while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible , ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of anthropology within dod
before wwii british social anthropology and american cultural anthropology were still distinct traditions
after the war , enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as sociocultural anthropology
there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work
one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical
the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place , problem or phenomenon in detail , using a variety of methods , over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia
in the 1990s and 2000s , calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture , of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins , and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard
these dynamic relationships , between what can be observed on the ground , as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology , whether cultural , biological , linguistic or archaeological
biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals ( behaviors , ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures )
they use many different methods of study , but modern population genetics , participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists into the field , which means traveling to a community in its own setting , to do something called fieldwork
on the biological or physical side , human measurements , genetic samples , nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs
along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions
human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material , such as the paleolithic and the neolithic , of particular use in archaeology
anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well , since mapping cultures is central to both sciences
by making comparisons across cultural traditions ( time - based ) and cultural regions ( space - based ) , anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science
because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises ( see history of anthropology ) , including but not limited to fossil - hunting , exploring , documentary film - making , paleontology , primatology , antiquity dealings and curatorship , philology , etymology , genetics , regional analysis , ethnology , history , philosophy , and religious studies , it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article , although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made
some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of other cultures , both in terms of time ( past societies ) and space ( non - european / non - western societies )
for example , the classic of urban anthropology , ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the third world had habitually received most of attention ; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in other cultures looked for them far away and started to look across the tracks only in late 1960s

in france , the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists , but this is increasingly changing , starting in the 1970s from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain ( fieldwork ) , and developing with the center founded by marc augé ( le centre danthropologie des mondes contemporains , the anthropological research center of contemporary societies )
since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region , frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale
there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people ; increasingly , research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories , social movements , governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses
agricultural science ( or agriscience for short ) is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact , natural , economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture
professionals of the agricultural science are called agricultural scientists or agriculturists

in 1843 , john lawes and joseph henry gilbert began a set of long - term field experiments at rothamsted research station in england , some of which are still running as of 2018
in the united states , a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the hatch act of 1887 , which used the term agricultural science
the hatch act was driven by farmers interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer
the smith - hughes act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots , but the scientific foundation had been built

pdf the origins of agriscience or where did all that scientific agriculture come from
intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and developing countries , often referred to as the green revolution , was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity , as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and pesticides
as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature , the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture , industrial development , and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields
these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology , such as integrated pest management , waste treatment technologies , landscape architecture , genomics , and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non - essential economic goods
in fact , the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science
new technologies , such as biotechnology and computer science ( for data processing and storage ) , and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields , including genetic engineering , agrophysics , improved statistical analysis , and precision farming
balancing these , as above , are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human - nature interactions of traditional agriculture , including interaction of religion and agriculture , and the non - material components of agricultural production systems - - gt ;
agriculture , agricultural science , and agronomy are often confused
however , they cover different concepts
alchemy ( from arabic al - kīmiyā ; from ancient greek khumeía ) is an ancient branch of natural philosophy , a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practiced in china , india , the muslim world , and europe
in its western form , alchemy is first attested in a number of pseudepigraphical texts written in greco - roman egypt during the first few centuries ad
alchemists attempted to purify , mature , and perfect certain materials
common aims were chrysopoeia , the transmutation of base metals ( for example , lead ) into noble metals ( particularly gold ) ; the creation of an elixir of immortality ; and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease
the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from the alchemical magnum opus ( great work )
the concept of creating the philosophers stone was variously connected with all of these projects
islamic and european alchemists developed a basic set of laboratory techniques , theories , and terms , some of which are still in use today
they did not abandon the ancient greek philosophical idea that everything is composed of four elements , and they tended to guard their work in secrecy , often making use of cyphers and cryptic symbolism
in europe , the 12th - century translations of medieval islamic works on science and the rediscovery of aristotelian philosophy gave birth to a flourishing tradition of latin alchemy
this late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role in the development of early modern science ( particularly chemistry and medicine )
modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects , despite criticisms by scholars such as eric holmyard and marie - louise von franz that they should be understood as complementary
the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences , who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry , medicine , and charlatanism , and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred
the latter interests historians of esotericism , psychologists , and some philosophers and spiritualists
the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts
the word alchemy comes from old french alquemie , alkimie , used in medieval latin as or ) , meaning the
others trace its roots to the egyptian name kēme ( hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 khmi ) , meaning black earth , which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the nile valley , as opposed to red desert sand
according to the egyptologist wallis budge , the arabic word al - kīmiyaʾ actually means the egyptian science , borrowing from the coptic word for egypt , kēme ( or its equivalent in the mediaeval bohairic dialect of coptic , khēme )
this coptic word derives from demotic kmỉ , itself from ancient egyptian kmt
the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black ( egypt was the black land , by contrast with the red land , the surrounding desert ) ; so this etymology could also explain the nickname egyptian black arts
alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents
these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships
one can distinguish at least three major strands , which appear to be mostly independent , at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy , centered in china ; indian alchemy , centered on the indian subcontinent ; and western alchemy , which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from greco - roman egypt to the islamic world , and finally medieval europe
chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths
in contrast , western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various western religions
it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin , or to what extent they influenced each other
the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt , where the city of alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge , and retained its pre - eminence through most of the greek and roman periods
following the work of andré - jean festugière , modern scholars see alchemical practice in the roman empire as originating from the egyptian goldsmiths art , greek philosophy and different religious traditions
can help in situating the other authors
zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors , such as mary the jewess , and agathodaimon , but very little is known about any of these authors
the most complete of their works , the four books of pseudo - democritus , were probably written in the first century ad
recent scholarship tends to emphasize the testimony of zosimus , who traced the alchemical arts back to egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices
zosimos of panopolis wrote in the final abstinence ( also known as the final count )
mythology – zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class , though there is little to no evidence for his assertion
alchemical writers used classical figures from greek , roman , and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation
these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets , isis , osiris , jason , and many others
the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus ( or thrice - great hermes )
his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes
hermes and his caduceus or serpent - staff , were among alchemys principal symbols
according to clement of alexandria , he wrote what were called the forty - two books of hermes , covering all fields of knowledge
the hermetica of thrice - great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice , called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners
these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era
technology – the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy , extending back to 3500bc
after suppressing a revolt in alexandria ( ad292 )
few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived , most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus dating from ad250–300 , they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones , cleaning and fabricating pearls , and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver
philosophy – alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism , platonism , stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemys character
an important example of alchemys roots in greek philosophy , originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle , was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth , air , water , and fire
according to aristotle , each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed
later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept
alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity
lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth
staugustine later affirmed this in the 4th 5th centuries , but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry
examples of pagan , christian , and jewish alchemists can be found during this period
most of the greco - roman alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms , such as moses , isis , cleopatra , democritus , and ostanes
others authors such as komarios , and chymes , we only know through fragments of text
after ad400 , greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors
by the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline
it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world , facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries
greek alchemy is preserved in medieval greek ( byzantine ) manuscripts , and yet historians have only relatively recently begun to pay attention to the study and development of greek alchemy in the byzantine period
the 2nd millennium bc text vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold
a considerable knowledge of metallurgy has been exhibited in a third - century ce buddhist texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold
according to some scholars greek alchemy may have influenced indian alchemy but there are no hard evidences to back this claim
multhauf , robert gilbert , robert andrew ( 2008 )
encyclopædia britannica ( 2008 )
the 11th - century persian chemist and physician abū rayhān bīrūnī , who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni , reported that they
the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of a divine body ( sanskrit divya - deham ) and immortality while still embodied ( sanskrit jīvan - mukti )
sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur , that are homologized with the semen of the god śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess devī
some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath
other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise kalyāṇakārakam of ugrāditya , written in south india in the early 9th century
two famous early indian alchemical authors were nāgārjuna siddha and nityanātha siddha
nāgārjuna siddha was a buddhist monk
his book , rasendramangalam , is an example of indian alchemy and medicine
nityanātha siddha wrote rasaratnākara , also a highly influential work
in sanskrit , rasa translates to mercury , and nāgārjuna siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold
scholarship on indian alchemy is in the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white
the contents of 39 sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in jan meulenbelds history of indian medical literature
the discussion of these works in himl gives a summary of the contents of each work , their special features , and where possible the evidence concerning their dating
chapter 13 of himl , various works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra ( or various works on alchemy and gems ) gives brief details of a further 655 ( six hundred and fifty - five ) treatises
in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works ; in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles
a great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature
the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet ( 2014 ) been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy
after the fall of the roman empire , the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world
much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed , most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations
the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word al - kīmiyā ( الكيمياء )
the early islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy
platonic and aristotelian thought , which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science , continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship
in the late ninth and early tenth centuries , the arabic works attributed to jābir ibn hayyān ( latinized as geber or geberus ) introduced a new approach to alchemy
paul kraus , who wrote the standard reference work on jabir , put it as follows
quoteto form an idea of the historical place of jabirs alchemy and to tackle the problem of its sources , it is advisable to compare it with what remains to us of the alchemical literature in the greek language
one knows in which miserable state this literature reached us
collected by byzantine scientists from the tenth century , the corpus of the greek alchemists is a cluster of incoherent fragments , going back to all the times since the third century until the end of the middle ages
the efforts of berthelot and ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results , and the later researchers , among them in particular mrs
hammer - jensen , tannery , lagercrantz , von lippmann , reitzenstein , ruska , bidez , festugière and others , could make clear only few points of detail
the study of the greek alchemists is not very encouraging
an even surface examination of the greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory even the supposedly technical writings , in the state where we find them today , are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation
it is different with jabirs alchemy
the relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati , the methodical classification of the substances , mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the greek texts
the theory on which jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity
more than with the other arab authors , one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching , between the ilm and the amal
in vain one would seek in the greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented , for example , in the book of seventy

islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism
the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir
jabirs ultimate goal was takwin , the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory , up to , and including , human life
he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness , coldness , dryness , and moistness
according to jabir , in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior
for example , lead was externally cold and dry , while gold was hot and moist
thus , jabir theorized , by rearranging the qualities of one metal , a different metal would result
by this reasoning , the search for the philosophers stone was introduced to western alchemy
jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substances name in arabic , when treated with various transformations , held correspondences to the elements physical properties
the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir
his original system consisted of seven elements , which included the five classical elements ( aether , air , earth , fire , and water ) in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulphur , the stone which burns , which characterized the principle of combustibility , and mercury , which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties
shortly thereafter , this evolved into eight elements , with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion , mercury giving volatility and stability , and salt giving solidity

from the 9th to 14th centuries , alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists , including alkindus , abū al - rayhān al - bīrūnī , avicenna and ibn khaldun
in particular , they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals
whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals , chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine
obed simon johnson , a study of chinese alchemy , shanghai , commercial p , 1928
new york arno p , 1974
the philosophers stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists
in the hermetic view , these two goals were not unconnected , and the philosophers stone was often equated with the universal panacea ; therefore , the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears
black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists
as previously stated above , chinese alchemy was more related to medicine
it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life
described in 9th - century texts it was used in cannons by 1290
from china , the use of gunpowder spread to japan , the mongols , the muslim world , and europe
gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in 1241 , and in europe by the 14th century
chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine , such as acupuncture and moxibustion
obed simon johnson , a study of chinese alchemy , shanghai , commercial p , 1928
new york arno p , 1974
in the early song dynasty , followers of this taoist idea ( chiefly the elite and upper class ) would ingest mercuric sulfide , which , though tolerable in low levels , led many to suicide
( the aforementioned tai chi chuan , etcetera ) chinese alchemy was introduced to the west by obed simon johnson

the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to 11 february 1144 , with the completion of robert of chesters translation of the arabic book of the composition of alchemy
although european craftsmen and technicians pre - existed , robert notes in his preface that alchemy ( though here still referring to the elixir rather than to the art itself ) was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing
the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th - century toledo , spain , through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath
meanwhile , theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism , thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought
the 11th - century stanselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context
in the early 12th century , peter abelard followed anselms work , laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west
in the early 13th century , robert grosseteste used abelards methods of analysis and added the use of observation , experimentation , and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations
grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking
through much of the 12th and 13th centuries , alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations , and new latin contributions were not made
the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists
in the 13th century , albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these , their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms albertus magnus , a dominican friar , is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time
albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna , where they concerned the transmutation of metals
from the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century , more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him , a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist
likewise , alchemical texts have been attributed to alberts student thomas aquinas
roger bacon , a franciscan friar who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics , comparative linguistics , and medicine , composed his great work ( as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time
while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic , he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemys connections to soteriology and christian theology
bacons writings integrated morality , salvation , alchemy , and the prolongation of life
his correspondence with clement highlighted this , noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy
like the greeks before him , bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres
he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle , the natural philosophers , and all latin writers of his time
the practical confirmed the theoretical , and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine
in later european legend , he became an archmage
in particular , along with albertus magnus , he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owners questions
soon after bacon , the influential work of pseudo - geber ( sometimes identified as paul of taranto ) appeared
his summa perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods
it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur - mercury theory , and the unusual clarity with which they were described
in the 14th century , alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars
alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves
dante , piers plowman , and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars
pope john xxiis 1317 edict , spondent quas non - exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo - alchemists
in 1403 , henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals ( although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically , and a number were granted by henry vi and edward iv )
these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo - alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy , which continued with an increasingly christian tone
the 14th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus , john of rupescissa , and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova
nicolas flamel is a well - known alchemist , but a good example of pseudepigraphy , the practice of giving your works the name of someone else , usually more famous
although the historical flamel existed , the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612
through the 14th and 15th centuries , alchemists were much like flamel they concentrated on looking for the philosophers stone
bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions
their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art
during the renaissance , hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy
the dawn of medical , pharmaceutical , occult , and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed
in the late 15th century , marsilio ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin
these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent
renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel
esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult hermeticism , fusing it with magic , astrology , and christian cabala
a key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa ( 1486–1535 ) , who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists
in his de occulta philosophia , he attempted to merge kabbalah , hermeticism , and alchemy
he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy
philippus aureolus paracelsus , ( theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim , 1493–1541 ) cast alchemy into a new form , rejecting some of agrippas occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia
paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote , many have said of alchemy , that it is for the making of gold and silver
for me such is not the aim , but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines
his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm
he took an approach different from those before him , using this analogy not in the manner of soul - purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies , and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them
iatrochemistry refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus
john dee ( 13 july 1527 – december , 1608 ) followed agrippas occult tradition
although better known for angel summoning , divination , and his role as astrologer , cryptographer , and consultant to queen elizabeth i , dees alchemical monas hieroglyphica , written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work
his writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below
during the 17th century , a short - lived supernatural interpretation of alchemy became popular , including support by fellows of the royal society robert boyle and elias ashmole
proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosophers stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels
journal of the history of ideas , 41 , 1980 , p
entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of renaissance europe
alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining , medical services , and the production of chemicals , medicines , metals , and gemstones
rudolf ii , holy roman emperor , in the late 16th century , famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague , including dee and his associate edward kelley
king james iv of scotland , julius , duke of brunswick - lüneburg , henry v , duke of brunswick - lüneburg , augustus , elector of saxony , julius echter von mespelbrunn , and maurice , landgrave of hesse - kassel all contracted alchemists
johns son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus
although most of these appointments were legitimate , the trend of pseudo - alchemical fraud continued through the renaissance
betrüger would use sleight of hand , or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage
legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations , distinguishing themselves from the con artists
false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud
the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period , and the differences between alchemy , chemistry and small - scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day
there were important overlaps between practitioners , and trying to classify them into alchemists , chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic
for example , tycho brahe ( 1546–1601 ) , an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations , had a laboratory built at his uraniborg observatory / research institute
michael sendivogius ( michał sędziwój , 1566–1636 ) , a polish alchemist , philosopher , medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600
sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who , in 1621 , applied this in a submarine
isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy ( see isaac newtons occult studies ) than he did to either optics or physics
other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle , and jan baptist van helmont
their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science
the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom
although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century , alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years , and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century
as late as 1781 james price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold
early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories , practices , and purposes scholastic and anti - aristotelian , paracelsian and anti - paracelsian , hermetic , neoplatonic , mechanistic , vitalistic , and more—plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof
robert boyle ( 1627–1691 ) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations
he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data
boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out , the wind characteristics , the position of the sun and moon , and the barometer reading , all just in case they proved to be relevant
this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries , based on revolutionary discoveries and ideas of lavoisier and john dalton
beginning around 1720 , a rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between alchemy and chemistry
by the 1740s , alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making , leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans , and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud
in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected , academic writers during the 18th - century scientific enlightenment attempted , for the sake of survival , to divorce and separate the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy
this move was mostly successful , and the consequences of this continued into the 19th , 20th and 21st centuries
during the occult revival of the early 19th century , alchemy received new attention as an occult science
the esoteric or occultist school , which arose during the 19th century , held ( and continues to hold ) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense , and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience
this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination , as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals , and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual , moral or mystical processes
in the 19th - century revival of alchemy , the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock , who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy
both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy , as atwood claimed no modern art or chemistry , notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims , has any thing in common with alchemy
atwoods work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi , arthur edward waite , and rudolf steiner
hitchcock , in his remarks upon alchymists ( 1855 ) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state
in 1845 , baron carl reichenbach , published his studies on odic force , a concept with some similarities to alchemy , but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion
in 1946 , louis cattiaux published the message retrouvé , a work that was at once philosophical , mystical and highly influenced by alchemy
in his lineage , many researchers , including emmanuel and charles dhooghvorst , are updating alchemical studies in france and belgium
several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy
michael maier names mary the jewess , cleopatra the alchemist , medera , and taphnutia as the four women who knew how to make the philosophers stone
zosimos sister theosebia ( later known as euthica the arab ) and isis the prophetess also played a role in early alchemical texts
the first alchemist whose name we know was mary the jewess ( c
essentially a double - boiler , it was ( and is ) used in chemistry for processes that require gentle heating
the tribikos ( a modified distillation apparatus ) and the kerotakis ( a more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations ) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her
due to the proliferation of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works , it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women
after the greco - roman period , womens names appear less frequently in the alchemical literature
women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods , aside from the fictitious account of perenelle flamel
mary anne atwoods a suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery ( 1850 ) marks their return during the nineteenth - century occult revival
the history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study
as the language of the alchemists is analyzed , historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history , such as the evolution of science and philosophy , the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities , kabbalism , spiritualism , rosicrucianism , and other mystic movements
journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ambix , published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry , and isis , published by the history of science society
western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born
concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology
as such , the classical elements appear in alchemical writings , as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity
similarly , the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature
the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosophers stone
due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature , and the 18th - century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry , the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations
those focusing on the exoteric , such as historians of science lawrence principe and william newman , have interpreted the decknamen ( or code words ) of alchemy as physical substances
these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts
at the opposite end of the spectrum , focusing on the esoteric , scholars , such as george calian
who question the reading of principe and newman , interpret these same decknamen as spiritual , religious , or psychological concepts
new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated , sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements
groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism
since the victorian revival of alchemy , occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice , involving the self - transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances , which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought
in the eyes of a variety of modern esoteric and neo - hermeticist practitioners , alchemy is fundamentally spiritual
in this interpretation , transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation , purification , and perfection
antoine faivre , wouter hanegraaff
western esotericism and the science of religion
according to this view , early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis ( c
ad 300 ) highlighted the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest , symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul
this approach is held to have continued in the middle ages , as metaphysical aspects , substances , physical states , and material processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities , spiritual states , and , ultimately , transformation
in this sense , the literal meanings of alchemical formulas were like a veil , hiding their true spiritual philosophy
in the neo - hermeticist interpretation , both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect , diseased , corruptible , and ephemeral state toward a perfect , healthy , incorruptible , and everlasting state , so the philosophers stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible
applied to the alchemist himself , the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment , and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal
in texts that are held to have been written according to this view , the cryptic alchemical symbols , diagrams , and textual imagery of late alchemical works are supposed to contain multiple layers of meanings , allegories , and references to other equally cryptic works ; which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning
in his 1766 alchemical catechism , théodore henri de tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic
when the philosophers speak of gold and silver , from which they extract their matter , are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar gold and silver
by no means ; vulgar silver and gold are dead , while those of the philosophers are full of life
alchemical symbolism has been important in depth and analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung
initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images , after being given a copy of the translation of the secret of the golden flower , a chinese alchemical text , by his friend richard wilhelm , jung discovered a direct correlation or parallels between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner , symbolic images coming up in dreams , visions or imaginations during the psychic processes of transformation occurring in his patients
a process , which he called process of individuation
he regarded the alchemical images as symbols expressing aspects of this process of individuation of which the creation of the gold or lapis within were symbols for its origin and goal

the volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemys popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites brought into contact and inner and outer , spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage
his writings are influential in psychology and for people who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams , symbols and the unconscious archetypal forces ( archetypes ) polly young - eisendrath , terence dawson

both von franz and jung have contributed greatly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture
jung wrote volumes on alchemy and his magnum opus is volume 14 of his collected works , mysterium coniunctionis
alchemy has had a long - standing relationship with art , seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment
literary alchemy appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to rowling , and also the popular japanese manga fullmetal alchemist
here , characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus
in the 14th century , chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late sir terry pratchett
visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy
while some of them used alchemy as a source of satire , others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work
music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers
in the last hundred years , alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction , film , television , novels , comics and video games
one goal of alchemy , the transmutation of base substances into gold , is now known to be impossible by chemical means but possible by physical means
although not financially worthwhile , gold was synthesized in particle accelerators as early as 1941
an astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of earth
they observe astronomical objects such as stars , planets , moons , comets and galaxies – in either observational ( by analyzing the data ) or theoretical astronomy
examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science , solar astronomy , the origin or evolution of stars , or the formation of galaxies
a related but distinct subject is physical cosmology , which studies the universe as a whole
astronomers usually fall under either of two main types observational and theoretical
observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data
in contrast , theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed
because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle , astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form , evolve , and die
they use these data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work
further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy , galactic astronomy , or physical cosmology
historically , astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky , while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws
today , that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable
professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities
they spend the majority of their time working on research , although they quite often have other duties such as teaching , building instruments , or aiding in the operation of an observatory
the american astronomical society , which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america , has approximately 7 , 000 members
this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics , geology , and engineering , whose research interests are closely related to astronomy
contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night , it is far more common to use a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera to record a long , deep exposure , allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time
before ccds , photographic plates were a common method of observation
modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year
analysis of observed phenomena , along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe , takes the majority of observational astronomers time
astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes
most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field
those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths , sciences and computing in high school
taking courses that teach how to research , write , and present papers are also invaluable
in college / university most astronomers get a phd in astronomy or physics
while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers , the field is popular among amateurs
most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties
the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world , comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations
like any hobby , most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research
however , amateurs span the range from so - called armchair astronomers to the very ambitious , who own science - grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research
ascii , abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange , is a character encoding standard for electronic communication
ascii codes represent text in computers , telecommunications equipment , and other devices
most modern character - encoding schemes are based on ascii , although they support many additional characters
the internet assigned numbers authority ( iana ) prefers the name us - ascii for this character encoding
ascii was developed from telegraph code
its first commercial use was as a seven - bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services
compared to earlier telegraph codes , the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting ( that is , alphabetization ) of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters
originally based on the english alphabet , ascii encodes 128 specified characters into seven - bit integers as shown by the ascii chart above
although a few are still commonly used , such as the carriage return , line feed , and tab codes
for example , lowercase i would be represented in the ascii encoding by binary 1101001 hexadecimal 69 ( i is the ninth letter ) decimal 105
the american standard code for information interchange ( ascii ) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the american standards association ( asa ) , called the x3 committee , by its x3 ( later x3l2 ) subcommittee , and later by that subcommittees x3
4 working group ( now incits )
the asa later became the united states of america standards institute ( usasi ) , and ultimately became the american national standards institute ( ansi )
with the other special characters and control codes filled in , ascii was published as asa x3 - 1963 , there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet
the 128 characters of the 7 - bit ascii character set are divided into eight 16 - character groups called sticks 0–7 , associated with the three most - significant bits
depending on the horizontal or vertical representation of the character map , sticks correspond with either table rows or columns
6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit , which simplified case - insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers
the x3 committee made other changes , including other new characters ( the brace and vertical bar characters ) , renaming some control characters ( som became start of header ( soh ) ) and moving or removing others ( ru was removed )
then usas x3 - 1968 , ansi x3 - 1977 , and finally , ansi x3 - 1986
in the x3 standard , the x3 committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted ( least significant bit first ) , and how it should be recorded on perforated tape
they proposed a 9 - track standard for magnetic tape , and attempted to deal with some punched card formats
the x3 subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems like other character encodings , ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols ( that is graphemes and control characters )
this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process , store , and communicate character - oriented information such as written language
before ascii was developed , the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters , 10 numerical digits , and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols
to include all these , and control characters compatible with the comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ( ccitt ) international telegraph alphabet no
2 ( ita2 ) standard of 1924 , fieldata ( 1956 ) , and early ebcdic ( 1963 ) , more than 64 codes were required for ascii
ita2 was in turn based on the 5 - bit telegraph code that émile baudot invented in 1870 and patented in 1874
the committee debated the possibility of a shift function ( like in ita2 ) , which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six - bit code
in a shifted code , some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes
it allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for data transmission , as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable
the standards committee decided against shifting , and so ascii required at least a seven - bit code
the committee considered an eight - bit code , since eight bits ( octets ) would allow two four - bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary - coded decimal
however , it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice
the committee voted to use a seven - bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission
since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position , it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired
the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together , for ease of identification
the first two so - called ascii sticks the space character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier , so it became position 20hex ; as was done in the dec sixbit code ( 1963 )
lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase
to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics , the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters , and the letter a was placed in position 41hex to match the draft of the corresponding british standard
the digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011 , but the remaining 4 bits correspond to their respective values in binary , making conversion with binary - coded decimal straightforward
many of the non - alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters ; an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters , not electric typewriters
early typewriters omitted 0 and 1 , using o ( capital letter o ) and l ( lowercase letter l ) instead , but 1 and 0 ) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common
thus , in ascii were placed in the second stick , the parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0 , however , because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character
this was accommodated by removing ( underscore ) from 6 and shifting the remaining characters , which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9
this discrepancy from typewriters led to bit - paired keyboards , notably the teletype model 33 , which used the left - shifted layout corresponding to ascii , differently from traditional mechanical typewriters
electric typewriters , notably the ibm selectric ( 1961 ) , used a somewhat different layout that has become de facto standard on computers and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did
the / pair also dates to the no
2 , and the , lt ;
gt ; pairs were used on some keyboards ( others , including the no
2 , did not shift , ( comma ) or
( full stop ) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting )
however , ascii split the ; pair ( dating to no
2 ) , and rearranged mathematical symbols ( varied conventions , commonly - ) to ; -
some then - common typewriter characters were not included , notably ½ ¼ ¢ , while were included as diacritics for international use , and lt ; gt ; for mathematical use , together with the simple line characters ( in addition to common / )
the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented à in the french variation , so the was placed in position 40hex , right before the letter
the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message ( som ) , end of address ( eoa ) , end of message ( eom ) , end of transmission ( eot ) , who are you ( wru ) , are you ( ru ) , a reserved device control ( dc0 ) , synchronous idle ( sync ) , and acknowledge ( ack )
these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns
ascii - code order is also called asciibetical order
collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order ( collating sequence )
the main deviations in ascii order are
ascii reserves the first 32 codes ( numbers 0–31 decimal ) for control characters codes originally intended not to represent printable information , but rather to control devices ( such as printers ) that make use of ascii , or to provide meta - information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape
for example , character 10 represents the line feed function ( which causes a printer to advance its paper ) , and character 8 represents backspace
no - ws - ctl
) except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line - oriented formatting , ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document
other schemes , such as markup languages , address page and document layout and formatting
the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character
the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional , for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream , and sometimes accidental , for example with the meaning of delete
probably the most influential single device affecting the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model 33 asr , which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader / punch option
paper tape was a very popular medium for long - term program storage until the 1980s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape
in particular , the teletype model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 ( control - q , dc1 , also known as xon ) , 19 ( control - s , dc3 , also known as xoff ) , and 127 ( delete ) became de facto standards
the model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control - g ( code 7 , bel , meaning audibly alert the operator ) literally , as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character
because the keytop for the o key also showed a left - arrow symbol ( from ascii - 1963 , which had this character instead of underscore ) , a noncompliant use of code 15 ( control - o , shift in ) interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected
when a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control - s ( xoff , an abbreviation for transmit off ) , it caused the tape reader to stop ; receiving control - q ( xon , transmit on ) caused the tape reader to resume
this so - called flow control technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending buffer overflow ; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique
on some systems , control - s retains its meaning but control - q is replaced by a second control - s to resume output
the 33 asr also could be configured to employ control - r ( dc2 ) and control - t ( dc4 ) to start and stop the tape punch ; on some units equipped with this function , the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively
the teletype could not move its typehead backwards , so it did not have a key on its keyboard to send a bs ( backspace )
instead , there was a key marked teletypes were commonly used with the less - expensive computers from digital equipment corporation ; these systems had to use what keys were available , and thus the del code was assigned to erase the previous character
because of this , dec video terminals ( by default ) sent the del code for the key marked backspace while the separate key marked delete sent an escape sequence ; many other competing terminals sent a bs code for the backspace key
the unix terminal driver could only use one code to erase the previous character , this could be set to bs or del , but not both , resulting in recurring situations of ambiguity where users had to decide depending on what terminal they were using ( shells that allow line editing , such as ksh , bash , and zsh , understand both )
the assumption that no key sent a bs code allowed controlh to be used for other purposes , such as the help prefix command in gnu emacs
many more of the control codes have been assigned meanings quite different from their original ones
the escape character ( esc , code 27 ) , for example , was intended originally to allow sending of other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning , a so - called escape sequence
this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings , c language strings , and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning
over time this interpretation has been co - opted and has eventually been changed
in modern usage , an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so - called ansi escape code ( or , more properly , a control sequence introducer ) from ecma - 48 ( 1972 ) and its successors , beginning with esc followed by a ( left - bracket ) character
in contrast , an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an out - of - band character used to terminate an operation or special mode , as in the teco and vi text editors
in graphical user interface ( gui ) and windowing systems , esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit ( terminate ) altogether
the inherent ambiguity of many control characters , combined with their historical usage , created problems when transferring plain text files between systems the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both carriage return ( which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line ) and line feed ( which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead )
the name carriage return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moves while the typebars that strike the ribbon remain stationary
the entire carriage had to be pushed ( returned ) to the left in order to position the paper for the next line
dec operating systems ( os / 8 , rt - 11 , rsx - 11 , rsts , tops - 10 , etcetera ) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device ( originally teletype machines ) would work
by the time so - called glass ttys ( later called crts or dumb terminals ) came along , the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing to follow it
when gary kildall created cp / m , he was inspired by some of the command line interface conventions used in decs rt - 11 operating system
until the introduction of pc dos in 1981 , ibm had no influence in this because their 1970s operating systems used ebcdic encoding instead of ascii , and they were oriented toward punch - card input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless
ibms pc dos ( also marketed as ms - dos by microsoft ) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on cp / m , and windows in turn inherited it from ms - dos
unfortunately , requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity as to how to interpret each character when encountered by itself
to simplify matters , plain text data streams , including files , on multics used line feed ( lf ) alone as a line terminator
unix and unix - like systems , and amiga systems , adopted this convention from multics
on the other hand , the original macintosh os , apple dos , and prodos used carriage return ( cr ) alone as a line terminator ; however , since apple has now replaced these obsolete operating systems with the unix - based macos operating system , they now use line feed ( lf ) as well
the radio shack trs - 80 also used a lone cr to terminate lines
computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops - 10 and tenex using cr - lf line endings ; machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings ; and machines running operating systems such as os / 360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and which used ebcdic rather than ascii encoding
the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal ( nvt ) , so that connections between hosts with different line - ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network
telnet used ascii along with cr - lf line endings , and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt
the pdp - 6 monitor , and its pdp - 10 successor tops - 10 , used control - z ( sub ) as an end - of - file indication for input from a terminal
some operating systems such as cp / m tracked file length only in units of disk blocks , and used control - z to mark the end of the actual text in the file
for these reasons , eof , or end - of - file , was used colloquially and conventionally as a three - letter acronym for control - z instead of substitute
the end - of - text code ( etx ) , also known as control - c , was inappropriate for a variety of reasons , while using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to its position at the end of the alphabet , and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid
a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream , usually from a keyboard
in c library and unix conventions , the null character is used to terminate text strings ; such null - terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz , where here z stands for zero
other representations might be used by specialist equipment , for example iso 2047 graphics or hexadecimal numbers
codes 20hex to 7ehex , known as the printable characters , represent letters , digits , punctuation marks , and a few miscellaneous symbols
there are 95 printable characters in total
code 20hex , the space character , denotes the space between words , as produced by the space bar of a keyboard
since the space character is considered an invisible graphic ( rather than a control character ) ( nb
almost identical wording to usas x3 - 1968 except for the intro
) it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section
code 7fhex corresponds to the non - printable delete ( del ) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart ; it is covered in the previous sections chart
earlier versions of ascii used the up arrow instead of the caret ( 5ehex ) and the left arrow instead of the underscore ( 5fhex )
ascii was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven - bit teleprinter code for american telephone telegraphs twx ( teletypewriter exchange ) network
twx originally used the earlier five - bit ita2 , which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system
bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence
his british colleague hugh mcgregor ross helped to popularize this work ( nb
bemer was employed at ibm at that time
) because of his extensive work on ascii , bemer has been called the father of ascii
on march 11 , 1968 , us president lyndon johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii , stating
i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce 91 ; luther hodges93 ; regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations
all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july 1 , 1969 , must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used
ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december 2007 , when utf - 8 encoding surpassed it ; utf - 8 is backward compatible with ascii
as computer technology spread throughout the world , different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of non - english languages that used roman - based alphabets
one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions , although some misuse that term to represent all variants , including those that do not preserve asciis character - map in the 7 - bit range
furthermore , the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii
from early in its development , ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard
other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso 646 ( 1967 ) that are identical or nearly identical to ascii , with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states , such as the symbol for the united kingdoms pound sterling ( £ ) ; for example with code page 1104
almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii , since ascii suited the needs of only the us and a few other countries
for example , canada had its own version that supported french characters
many other countries developed variants of ascii to include non - english letters ( for example é , ñ , ß , ł ) , currency symbols ( for example £ , ¥ ) , etcetera see also yuscii ( yugoslavia )
it would share most characters in common , but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use
however , the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii - 1963 and isos first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused asciis choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world , causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points
iso / iec 646 , like ascii , is a 7 - bit character set
it does not make any additional codes available , so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries
escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text , but they were rarely used , so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and , therefore , which character a code represented , and in general , text - processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway
because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso / iec 646 , a german , french , or swedish , etcetera programmer using their national variant of iso / iec 646 , rather than ascii , had to write , and , thus , read , something such as
c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi c , although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use
many programmers kept their computers on us - ascii , so plain - text in swedish , german etcetera ( for example , in e - mail or usenet ) contained , and similar variants in the middle of words , something those programmers got used to
for example , a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch , could get n jag har smrgsar as the answer , which should be nä jag har smörgåsar meaning no ive got sandwiches
in japan and korea , still a variation of ascii is used , in which the backslash ( 5c hex ) is rendered as ¥ ( a yen sign , in japan ) or ₩ ( a won sign , in korea )
this means that , for example , the file path cuserssmith is shown as c¥users¥smith ( in japan ) or c₩users₩smith ( in korea )
eventually , as 8 - , 16 - , and 32 - bit ( and later 64 - bit ) computers began to replace 12 - , 18 - , and 36 - bit computers as the norm , it became common to use an 8 - bit byte to store each character in memory , providing an opportunity for extended , 8 - bit relatives of ascii
in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii , leaving the original character - mapping intact , but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 ( that is , 7 - bit ) characters
encodings include iscii ( india ) , viscii ( vietnam )
although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii , true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard
most early home computer systems developed their own 8 - bit character sets containing line - drawing and game glyphs , and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics
kaypro cp / m computers used the upper 128 characters for the greek alphabet
the petscii code commodore international used for their 8 - bit systems is probably unique among post - 1970 codes in being based on ascii - 1963 , instead of the more common ascii - 1967 , such as found on the zx spectrum computer
atari 8 - bit computers and galaksija computers also used ascii variants
the ibm pc defined code page 437 , which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces , and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions
operating systems such as dos supported these code pages , and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware
digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set ( dec - mcs ) for use in the popular vt220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics
the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined a set , both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like modern character sets
the iso / iec 8859 standard ( derived from the dec - mcs ) finally provided a standard that most systems copied ( at least as accurately as they copied ascii , but with many substitutions )
a popular further extension designed by microsoft , windows - 1252 ( often mislabeled as iso - 8859 - 1 ) , added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing
iso - 8859 - 1 , windows - 1252 , and the original 7 - bit ascii were the most common character encodings until 2008 when utf - 8 became more common
iso / iec 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9f hexadecimal range , as part of extending the 7 - bit ascii encoding to become an 8 - bit system
unicode and the iso / iec 10646 universal character set ( ucs ) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso / iec 8859 and ascii rapidly in many environments
while ascii is limited to 128 characters , unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification ( using natural numbers called code points ) and encoding ( to 8 - , 16 - , or 32 - bit binary formats , called utf - 8 , utf - 16 , and utf - 32 , respectively )
ascii was incorporated into the unicode ( 1991 ) character set as the first 128 symbols , so the 7 - bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets
this allows utf - 8 to be backward compatible with 7 - bit ascii , as a utf - 8 file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters
even more importantly , forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7 - bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set ( as is often done to support 8 - bit ascii extensions such as iso - 8859 - 1 ) will preserve utf - 8 data unchanged
this article already contains ascii code charts , therefore any link to such a chart does not pass wpelno 1 and will be deleted
this article is not about so - called extended ascii , therefore any link to a page about extended ascii is not relevant and will be deleted
ascii converters are a dime a dozen , so choosing any one would be linkspam for that site

animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images
in traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film
today , most animations are made with computer - generated imagery ( cgi )
computer animation can be very detailed 3d animation , while 2d computer animation ( which may have the look of traditional animation ) can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth , or faster real - time renderings
other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two - and three - dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets , or clay figures
an animated cartoon is an animated film , usually a short film , featuring an exaggerated visual style
the style takes inspiration from comic strips , often featuring anthropomorphic animals , superheroes , or the adventures of human protagonists ( either children or adults )
especially with animals that form a natural predator / prey relationship ( for example cats and mice , coyotes and birds ) , the action often centers around violent pratfalls such as falls , collisions , and explosions that would be lethal in real life
the illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to persistence of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and / or beta movement , but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain
the illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other , with unnoticeable interruptions , is a stroboscopic effect
while animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background , computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment
analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope , and film
television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally
for display on computers , technology such as the animated gif and flash animation were developed
in addition to short films , feature films , television series , animated gifs , and other media dedicated to the display of moving images , animation is also prevalent in video games , motion graphics , user interfaces , and visual effects
the physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance moving images in magic lantern shows—can also be considered animation
the mechanical manipulation of three - dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata
electronic automata were popularized by disney as animatronics
the word animation stems from the latin animātiōn , stem of animātiō , meaning a bestowing of life
the primary meaning of the english word is liveliness and has been in use much longer than the meaning of moving image medium
hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation , people all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry , automata , shadow play , and the magic lantern
the multi - media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in european theatres from the late 18th century through the first half of the 19th century , featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion
in 1833 , the stroboscopic disc ( better known as the phénakisticope ) introduced the principle of modern animation with sequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures
series of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years , but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to represent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with a proper systematic breakdown of movements
the stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the zoetrope ( 1866 ) , the flip book ( 1868 ) and the praxinoscope ( 1877 )
a typical 19th - century animation contained about 12 images that were displayed as a continuous loop by spinning a device manually
the flip book often contained more pictures and had a beginning and end , but its animation would not last longer than a few seconds
the first to create much longer sequences seems to have been charles - émile reynaud , who between 1892 and 1900 had much success with his 10 - to 15 - minute - long pantomimes lumineuses
when cinematography eventually broke through in 1895 after animated pictures had been known for decades , the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment
animation on film was not commercialized until a few years later by manufacturers of optical toys , with chromolithography film loops ( often traced from live - action footage ) for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home
it would take some more years before animation reached movie theaters
after earlier experiments by movie pioneers stuart blackton , arthur melbourne - cooper , segundo de chomón , and edwin porter ( among others ) , blacktons the haunted hotel ( 1907 ) was the first huge stop motion success , baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail , without signs of any known stage trick
émile cohls fantasmagorie ( 1908 ) is the oldest known example of what became known as traditional ( hand - drawn ) animation
other great artistic and very influential short films were created by ladislas starevich with his puppet animations since 1910 and by winsor mccay with detailed drawn animation in films such as little nemo ( 1911 ) and gertie the dinosaur ( 1914 )
during the 1910s , the production of animated cartoons became an industry in the us
felix the cat , who debuted in 1919 , became the first animated superstar
in 1928 , steamboat willie , featuring mickey mouse and minnie mouse , popularized film with synchronized sound and put walt disneys studio at the forefront of the animation industry
the enormous success of mickey mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of american animation that would last until the 1960s
the united states dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel - animated theatrical shorts
several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long - lasting careers , including walt disney productions goofy ( 1932 ) and donald duck ( 1934 ) , warner bros
cartoons looney tunes characters like porky pig ( 1935 ) , daffy duck ( 1937 ) , bugs bunny ( 1938–1940 ) , tweety ( 1941–1942 ) , sylvester the cat ( 1945 ) , wile coyote and road runner ( 1949 ) , fleischer studios / paramount cartoon studios betty boop ( 1930 ) , popeye ( 1933 ) , superman ( 1941 ) and casper ( 1945 ) , mgm cartoon studios tom and jerry ( 1940 ) and droopy , walter lantz productions / universal studio cartoons woody woodpecker ( 1940 ) , terrytoons / 20th century foxs gandy goose ( 1938 ) , dinky duck ( 1939 ) , mighty mouse ( 1942 ) and heckle and jeckle ( 1946 ) and united artists pink panther ( 1963 )
in 1917 , italian - argentine director quirino cristiani made the first feature - length film el apóstol ( now lost ) , which became a critical and commercial success
it was followed by cristianis sin dejar rastros in 1918 , but one day after its premiere , the film was confiscated by the government
after working on it for three years , lotte reiniger released the german feature - length silhouette animation die abenteuer des prinzen achmed in 1926 , the oldest extant animated feature
in 1937 , walt disney studios premiered their first animated feature , snow white and the seven dwarfs , one of the highest - grossing traditional animation features 1987 and 1993 grosses from north america the fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with gullivers travels with some success
partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the second world war , disneys next features pinocchio , fantasia ( both 1940 ) and fleischer studios second animated feature mr
bug goes to town ( 1941–1942 ) failed at the box office
for decades afterward , disney would be the only american studio to regularly produce animated features , until ralph bakshi became the first to also release more than a handful features
sullivan - bluth studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with an american tail in 1986
although relatively few titles became as successful as disneys features , other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles , relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques
russias soyuzmultfilm animation studio , founded in 1936 , produced 20 films ( including shorts ) per year on average and reached 1 , 582 titles in 2018
china , czechoslovakia / czech republic , italy , france , and belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films , while japan became a true powerhouse of animation production , with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation
animation became very popular on television since the 1950s , when television sets started to become common in most developed countries
cartoons were mainly programmed for children , on convenient time slots , and especially us youth spent many hours watching saturday - morning cartoons
many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s , the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to tv series
hanna - barbera productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series , such as the flintstones ( 1960–1966 ) ( the first prime time animated series ) , scooby - doo ( since 1969 ) and belgian co - production the smurfs ( 1981–1989 )
the constraints of american television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts
quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as the simpsons ( since 1989 ) as part of a renaissance of american animation
while us animated series also spawned successes internationally , many other countries produced their own child - oriented programming , relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation
japanese anime tv series became very successful internationally since the 1960s , and european producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co - productions with japanese studios , resulting in hit series such as barbapapa ( the netherlands / japan / france 1973–1977 ) , wickie und die starken männer / 小さなバイキング ビッケ ( vicky the viking ) ( austria / germany / japan 1974 ) , and the jungle book ( italy / japan 1989 )
computer animation was gradually developed since the 1940s
3d wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s , with an early ( short ) appearance in the sci - fi thriller futureworld ( 1976 )
the rescuers down under was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera
it was produced in a style thats very similar to traditional cel animation on the computer animation production system ( caps ) , developed by the walt disney company in collaboration with pixar in the late 1980s
the so - called 3d style , more often associated with computer animation , has become extremely popular since pixars toy story ( 1995 ) , the first computer - animated feature in this style
most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s , as it proved cheaper and more profitable
not only the very popular 3d animation style was generated with computers , but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand - crafted appearance , in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software , while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects
in 2010 , the animation market was estimated to be worth circa us80 billion
animated feature - length films returned the highest gross margins ( around 52 ) of all film genres between 2004 and 2013
animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early 2020s
the clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction , while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality
it has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainment
during world war ii , animation was widely exploited for propaganda
many american studios , including warner bros
and disney , lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values
some countries , including china , japan and the united kingdom , produced their first feature - length animation for their war efforts
animation has been very popular in television commercials , both due to its graphic appeal , and the humour it can provide
some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades , such as snap , crackle and pop in advertisements for kelloggs cereals
the legendary animation director tex avery was the producer of the first raid kills bugs dead commercials in 1966 , which were very successful for the company
apart from their success in movie theaters and television series , many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media
animation has traditionally been very closely related to comic books
while many comic book characters found their way to the screen ( which is often the case in japan , where many manga are adapted into anime ) , original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines
somewhat similarly , characters and plots for video games ( an interactive animation medium ) have been derived from films and vice versa
some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media
stories and images can easily be adapted into childrens books and other printed media
songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media
while very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media , the walt disney company is the best known and most extreme example
since first being licensed for a childrens writing tablet in 1929 , their mickey mouse mascot has been depicted on an enormous amount of products , as have many other disney characters
this may have influenced some pejorative use of mickeys name , but licensed disney products sell well , and the so - called disneyana has many avid collectors , and even a dedicated disneyana fanclub ( since 1984 )
disneyland opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on disneys cartoon characters
its enormous success spawned several other disney theme parks and resorts
disneys earnings from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies
criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception
with its popularity , a large amount of criticism has arisen , especially animated feature - length films
as with any other form of media , animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field
many are part of general or regional film award programs , like the chinas golden rooster award for best animation ( since 1981 )
awards programs dedicated to animation , with many categories , include asifa - hollywoods annie awards , the emile awards in europe and the anima mundi awards in brazil
apart from academy awards for best animated short film ( since 1932 ) and best animated feature ( since 2002 ) , animated movies have been nominated and rewarded in other categories , relatively often for best original song and best original score
beauty and the beast was the first animated film nominated for best picture , in 1991
up ( 2009 ) and toy story 3 ( 2010 ) also received best picture nominations , after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten
the creation of non - trivial animation works ( that is , longer than a few seconds ) has developed as a form of filmmaking , with certain unique aspects
the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase , the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live - action films it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five - minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film
while live - action films are now also storyboarded , they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards ( that is , real - time improvisation )
another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a films consistency from start to finish , even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger
animators , like all artists , necessarily have individual styles , but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film
this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins
character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions , posed in different positions , and viewed from different angles
on traditionally animated projects , maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles
unlike live - action films , animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format ; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film
in the early 1960s , animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays ( while also continuing to use story departments ) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s
traditional animation ( also called cel animation or hand - drawn animation ) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century
to create the illusion of movement , each drawing differs slightly from the one before it
the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels , the completed character cels are photographed one - by - one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film
the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century
today , animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system
various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects
some animation producers have used the term tradigital ( a play on the words traditional and digital ) to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology
examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio ( united states , 1940 ) , spirited away ( japan , 2001 ) , the triplets of belleville ( france , 2003 ) , and the secret of kells ( irish - french - belgian , 2009 )
full animation refers to the process of producing high - quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement , fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles , from more realistically animated works like those produced by the walt disney studio ( the little mermaid , beauty and the beast , aladdin , the lion king ) to the more cartoon styles of the warner bros
animation studio
many of the disney animated features are examples of full animation , as are non - disney works , the secret of nimh ( us , 1982 ) , the iron giant ( us , 1999 ) , and nocturna ( spain , 2007 )
fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second , with a combination of animation on ones and twos , meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24
limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or skippy movement animation
limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression , as in gerald mcboing - boing ( us , 1951 ) , yellow submarine ( uk , 1968 ) , and certain anime produced in japan
filmation , ) and later the internet ( web cartoons )
rotoscoping is a technique patented by max fleischer in 1917 where animators trace live - action movement , frame by frame
as in the lord of the rings ( us , 1978 ) , or used in a stylized and expressive manner , as in waking life ( us , 2001 ) and a scanner darkly ( us , 2006 )
some other examples are fire and ice ( us , 1983 ) , heavy metal ( 1981 ) , and aku no hana ( japan , 2013 )
live - action / animation is a technique combining hand - drawn characters into live action shots or live - action actors into animated shots
walt disney and ub iwerks created a series of alice comedies ( 1923–1927 ) , in which a live - action girl enters an animated world
other examples include allegro non troppo ( italy , 1976 ) , who framed roger rabbit ( us , 1988 ) , volere volare ( italy 1991 ) , space jam ( us , 1996 ) and osmosis jones ( us , 2001 )
stop - motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real - world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement
computer software is widely available to create this type of animation ; traditional stop - motion animation is usually less expensive but more time - consuming to produce than current computer animation
; puppet animation typically involves stop - motion puppet figures interacting in a constructed environment , in contrast to real - world interaction in model animation
examples include the tale of the fox ( france , 1937 ) , the nightmare before christmas ( us , 1993 ) , corpse bride ( us , 2005 ) , coraline ( us , 2009 ) , the films of jiří trnka and the adult animated sketch - comedy television series robot chicken ( us , 2005–present )
; clay animation or plasticine animation ( often called claymation , which , however , is a trademarked name )
it uses figures made of clay or a similar malleable material to create stop - motion animation
the figures may have an armature or wire frame inside , similar to the related puppet animation ( below ) , that can be manipulated to pose the figures
; strata - cut animation most commonly a form of clay animation in which a long bread - like loaf of clay , internally packed tight and loaded with varying imagery , is sliced into thin sheets , with the animation camera taking a frame of the end of the loaf for each cut , eventually revealing the movement of the internal images within
; cutout animation a type of stop - motion animation produced by moving two - dimensional pieces of material paper or cloth
examples include terry gilliams animated sequences from monty pythons flying circus ( uk , 1969–1974 ) ; fantastic planet ( france / czechoslovakia , 1973 ) ; tale of tales ( russia , 1979 ) , the pilot episode of the adult television sitcom series ( and sometimes in episodes ) of south park ( us , 1997 ) and the music video live for the moment , from verona riots band ( produced by alberto serrano and nívola uyá , spain 2014 )
; silhouette animation a variant of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes
examples include the adventures of prince achmed ( weimar republic , 1926 ) and princes et princesses ( france , 2000 )
; model animation refers to stop - motion animation created to interact with and exist as a part of a live - action world
intercutting , matte effects and split screens are often employed to blend stop - motion characters or objects with live actors and settings
examples include the work of ray harryhausen , as seen in films , jason and the argonauts ( 1963 ) , and the work of willis obrien on films , king kong ( 1933 )
; go motion a variant of model animation that uses various techniques to create motion blur between frames of film , which is not present in traditional stop motion
another example is the dragon named vermithrax from the 1981 film dragonslayer
; object animation refers to the use of regular inanimate objects in stop - motion animation , as opposed to specially created items
; graphic animation uses non - drawn flat visual graphic material ( photographs , newspaper clippings , magazines , etcetera ) , which are sometimes manipulated frame by frame to create movement
at other times , the graphics remain stationary , while the stop - motion camera is moved to create on - screen action
; brickfilm a subgenre of object animation involving using lego or other similar brick toys to make an animation
these have had a recent boost in popularity with the advent of video sharing sites , youtube and the availability of cheap cameras and animation software
; pixilation involves the use of live humans as stop - motion characters
examples of pixilation include the secret adventures of tom thumb and angry kid shorts , and the academy award - winning neighbours by norman mclaren
computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques , the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer
2d animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3d techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact
2d animation figures are created or edited on the computer using 2d bitmap graphics and 2d vector graphics
onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping
2d animation has many applications , including analog computer animation , flash animation , and powerpoint animation
cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated
final line advection animation is a technique used in 2d animation , speaking about using this approach in paperman , john kahrs said that our animators can change things , actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want , and change the profile of the arm
3d animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator
the 3d model maker usually starts by creating a 3d polygon mesh for the animator to manipulate
sometimes , the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices
this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with key frames to create movement
other techniques can be applied , mathematical functions ( for example , gravity , particle simulations ) , simulated fur or hair , and effects , fire and water simulations
as the patron deity of delphi ( apollo pythios ) , apollo is an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle
apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil ; various epithets call him the averter of evil
delphic apollo is the patron of seafarers , foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees
medicine and healing are associated with apollo , whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius
apollo delivered people from epidemics , yet he is also a god who could bring ill - health and deadly plague with his arrows
the invention of archery itself is credited to apollo and his sister artemis
apollo is usually described as carrying a golden bow and a quiver of silver arrows
apollos capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona
as a protector of the young and dedicated to apollo
apollo is an important pastoral deity , and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds
protection of herds , flocks and crops from diseases , pests and predators were his primary duties
on the other hand , apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution
he is associated with dominion over colonists
he was the giver of laws , and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in a city
as the god of mousike , apollo presides over all music , songs , dance and poetry
he is the inventor of string - music , and the frequent companion of the muses , functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations
the lyre is a common attribute of apollo
in hellenistic times , especially during the 5th century bce , as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios , the personification of the sun
in latin texts , however , there was no conflation of apollo with sol among the classical latin poets until 1st century ce
apollo and helios / sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century ce
the name apollo—unlike the related older name paean—is generally not found in the linear b ( mycenean greek ) texts , although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form pe - rjo - ( linear b - ) on the kn e 842 tablet , though it has also been suggested that the name might actually read hyperion ( u - pe - rjo - ne )
the etymology of the name is uncertain
the spelling in classical attic ) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era , but the doric form , ) , is more archaic , as it is derived from an earlier ) , ( ( , and apollon was the
several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors
thus , the greeks most often associated apollos name with the greek verb ) , to destroy
a number of non - greek etymologies have been suggested for the name , the hittite form apaliunas ( d , which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot
note the labiovelar in place of the labial / p / found in pre - doric ἀπέλjων and hittite apaliunas
a luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo the one of entrapment , perhaps in the sense of hunter
apollos chief epithet was phoebus ( ; ) , literally bright
it was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans for apollos role as the god of light
like other greek deities , he had a number of others applied to him , reflecting the variety of roles , duties , and aspects ascribed to the god
however , while apollo has a great number of appellations in greek myth , only a few occur in latin literature
apollo was worshipped throughout the roman empire
in the traditionally celtic lands , he was most often seen as a healing and sun god
he was often equated with celtic gods of similar character
the cult centers of apollo in greece , delphi and delos , date from the 8th century bce
the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis , apollos twin sister
at delphi , apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent python
for the greeks , apollo was the most greek of all the gods , and through the centuries he acquired different functions
in archaic greece he was the prophet , the oracular god who in older times was connected with healing
in classical greece he was the god of light and of music , but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil
walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship , which he termed a dorian - northwest greek component , a cretan - minoan component , and a syro - hittite component
in classical times , his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil , and he was therefore called apotropaios ( keeping off ill ; from v
apollo also had many epithets relating to his function as a healer
some commonly - used examples are paion ( , succouring ) , oulios (
apollo in his aspect of healer has a connection to the primitive god paean puts pain - relieving medicines on the wounds of pluton and ares ( ilias e401 )
this art is related with egypt ( odyssey d232 ) nilsson vol i , p
543 it is suggested , though unconfirmed , that he is connected to the mycenaean figure pa - ja - wo - ne ( linear b paean was the personification of holy songs sung by seer - doctors (
which is sung to stop the plagues and the diseases
proklos chrestom from photios bibl
die geschicthe der griechischen religion
vol i , p
homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph
such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus , to apollo helios , to apollos son asclepius the healer
about the 4th century bce , the paean became merely a formula of adulation ; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered
it was in this way that apollo had become recognized as the god of music
apollos role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory ; hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle , when a fleet left the harbour , and also after a victory had been won
in the iliad , apollo is the healer under the gods , but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows , similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra
the conception that the diseases come from invisible shots sent by magicians or supernatural beings is common in primitive people and also in european folklore
in north - europe they speak of the elf - shots
in sweden where the lapps were called magicians , they speak of the lappen - shots
martin nilsson ( 1967 )
vol i , p
541 he sends a plague to the achaeans
knowing that apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent , they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows , called a hecatomb
the homeric hymn to apollo depicts apollo as an intruder from the north
the connection with the northern - dwelling dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars
the family - festival was dedicated to apollo ( doric however it can explain only the doric type of the name , which is connected with the ancient macedonian word pella ( pella ) , stone
stones played an important part in the cult of the god , especially in the oracular shrine of delphi ( omphalos )
george huxley regarded the identification of apollo with the minoan deity paiawon , worshipped in crete , to have originated at delphi
in the homeric hymn , apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi , where they evidently transferred their religious practices
apollo delphinios or delphidios was a sea - god especially worshipped in crete and in the islands
apollos sister artemis , who was the greek goddess of hunting , is identified with britomartis ( diktynna ) , the minoan mistress of the animals
in her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the master of the animals , a bow - wielding god of hunting whose name has been lost ; aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular apollo
martin nilsson ( 1967 ) , vol i , pp
a non - greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship
the name of apollos mother leto has lydian origin , and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor
the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia , which is the origin of sibyl , and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated
omens , symbols , purifications , and exorcisms appear in old assyro - babylonian texts
these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites , and from there into greece
martin nilsson
die geschichte der griechische religion vol i , pp
homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans , fighting against the achaeans , during the trojan war
he is pictured as a terrible god , less trusted by the greeks than other gods
the god seems to be related to appaliunas , a tutelary god of wilusa ( troy ) in asia minor , but the word is not complete
the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo
a western anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of artimus ( artemis ) and qλdãns , whose name may be cognate with the hittite and doric forms , in surviving lydian texts
the greeks gave to him the name agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column
however , while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon , all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month , and the emphasis given to that day ( sibutu ) indicates a babylonian origin
the late bronze age ( from 1700 to 1200 bce ) hittite and hurrian aplu was a god of plague , invoked during plague years
here we have an apotropaic situation , where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it
aplu , meaning the son of , was a title given to the god nergal , who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash
de grummond , nancy thomson ( 2006 ) etruscan myth , sacred history , and legend
( philadelphia , pennsylvania university of pennsylvania museum of archaeology and anthropology ) ; mackenzie , donald ( 2005 ) myths of babylonia and assyria ( gutenberg ) homer interprets apollo as a terrible god who brings death and disease with his arrows , but who can also heal , possessing a magic art that separates him from the other greek gods
in iliad , his priest prays to apollo smintheus , the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats
all these functions , including the function of the healer - god paean , who seems to have mycenean origin , are fused in the cult of apollo
the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo
the terrible god is called the archer and the bow is also an attribute of shiva
rudra could bring diseases with his arrows , but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiva is a healer physician god
however the indo - european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens , exorcisms , and with the oracular cult
unusually among the olympic deities , apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence delos and delphi
in cult practice , delian apollo and pythian apollo ( the apollo of delphi ) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality
lycia was sacred to the god , for this apollo was also called lycian
apollos cult was already fully established when written sources commenced , about 650 bce
apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period , and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity
oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites
in the 2nd and 3rd century ce , those at didyma and claros pronounced the so - called theological oracles , in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all - encompassing , highest deity
in the 3rd century , apollo fell silent
julian the apostate ( 359–361 ) tried to revive the delphic oracle , but failed
apollo had a famous oracle in delphi , and other notable ones in claros and didyma
his oracular shrine in abae in phocis , where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus ( , apollon abaios ) , was important enough to be consulted by croesus
many temples were dedicated to apollo in greece and the greek colonies
they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of the greek architecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations
some of the earliest temples , especially in crete , do not belong to any greek order
it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures
the different wooden elements were considered divine , and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order
the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances
the temples should be canonic , and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection
from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings
the first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof , and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras , who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics
bowra ( 1957 )
the greek experience , p
the doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century bc but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs , which couldnt be solved without changing the original forms the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order , but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple
both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome
apollo appears often in the myths , plays and hymns
as zeus favorite son , apollo had direct access to the mind of zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans
a divinity beyond human comprehension , he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god
apollo was the son of zeus , the king of the gods , and leto , his previous wife or one of his mistresses
growing up , apollo was nursed by the nymphs korythalia and aletheia , the personification of truth
when zeus wife hera discovered that leto was pregnant , she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma
leto sought shelter in many lands , only to be rejected by them
finally , the voice of unborn apollo informed his mother about a floating island named delos that had once been asteria , letos own sister
callimachus , hymn to delos since it was neither a mainland nor an island , leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree
all the goddesses except hera were present to witness the event
it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia , the goddess of childbirth , to prevent leto from going into labor
the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards ( 8 m ) long
when apollo was born , clutching a golden sword , everything on delos turned into gold and the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance
swans circled the island seven times and the nymphs sang in delight
he was washed clean by the goddesses who then covered him in white garment and fastened golden bands around him
since leto was unable to feed him , themis , the goddess of divine law , fed him with nectar , or ambrosia
upon tasting the divine food , apollo broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery , and interpret the will of zeus to humankind
homer , hymn to apollo zeus , who had calmed hera by then , came and adorned his son with a golden headband
apollos birth fixed the floating delos to the earth
leto promised that her son would be always favorable towards the delians
according to some , apollo secured delos to the bottom of the ocean after some time
this island became sacred to apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god
apollo was born on the seventh day (
of the month thargelion—according to delian tradition—or of the month bysios—according to delphian tradition
the seventh and twentieth , the days of the new and full moon , were ever afterwards held sacred to him
mythographers agree that artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of apollo or was born on the island of ortygia then helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo
hyperborea , the mystical land of eternal spring , venerated apollo above all the gods
the hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted pythian games
there , a vast forest of beautiful trees was called the garden of apollo
apollo spent the winter months among the hyperboreans
his absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death
no prophecies were issued during this time
joseph eddy fontenrose , python a study of delphic myth and its origins he returned to the world during the beginning of the spring
the theophania festival was held in delphi to celebrate his return
it is said that leto came to delos from hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves
henceforth , hyperborea became apollos winter home and wolves became sacred to him
his intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet lyceus , meaning wolf - like
but apollo was also the wolf - slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators
the hyperborean worship of apollo bears the strongest marks of apollo being worshipped as the sun god
shamanistic elements in apollos cult are often liked to his hyperborean origin , and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman
shamans like abaris and aristeas were also the followers of apollo , who hailed from hyperborea
in myths , the tears of amber apollo shed when his son asclepius died became the waters of the river eridanos , which surrounded hyperborea
apollo also buried in hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the cyclopes
he later gave this arrow to abaris
as a child , apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on delos using the horns of the goats that his sister artemis hunted
since he learnt the art of building when young , he later came to be known as archegetes , the founder ( of towns ) and god who guided men to build new cities
from his father zeus , apollo had also received a golden chariot drawn by swans
timothy bridgman
in his early years when apollo spent his time herding cows , he was reared by thriae , the bee nymphs , who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills
apollo is also said to have invented the lyre , and along with artemis , the art of archery
he then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery
phoebe , his grandmother , gave the oracular shrine of delphi to apollo as a birthday gift
themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of delphi thereon
python , a chthonic serpent - dragon , was a child of gaia and the guardian of the delphic oracle , whose death was foretold by apollo when he was still in letos womb
python was the nurse of the giant typhon
in most of the traditions , apollo was still a child when he killed python
python was sent by hera to hunt the pregnant leto to death , and had assaulted her
to avenge the trouble given to his mother , apollo went in search of python and killed it in the sacred cave at delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from hephaestus
the delphian nymphs who were present encouraged apollo during the battle with the cry hie paean
after apollo was victorious , they also brought him gifts and gave the corycian cave to him
according to homer , apollo had encountered and killed the python when he was looking for a place to establish his shrine
according to another version , when leto was in delphi , python had attacked her
apollo defended his mother and killed python
euripides in his iphigenia in aulis gives an account of his fight with python and the events aftermath
you killed him , o phoebus , while still a baby , still leaping in the arms of your dear mother , and you entered the holy shrine , and sat on the golden tripod , on your truthful throne distributing prophecies from the gods to mortals
a detailed account of apollos conflict with gaia and zeus intervention on behalf of his young son is also given
but when apollo came and sent themis , the child of earth , away from the holy oracle of pytho , earth gave birth to dream visions of the night ; and they told to the cities of men the present , and what will happen in the future , through dark beds of sleep on the ground ; and so earth took the office of prophecy away from phoebus , in envy , because of her daughter
the lord made his swift way to olympus and wound his baby hands around zeus , asking him to take the wrath of the earth goddess from the pythian home
zeus smiled , that the child so quickly came to ask for worship that pays in gold
he shook his locks of hair , put an end to the night voices , and took away from mortals the truth that appears in darkness , and gave the privilege back again to loxias
apollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made inferior to his , a wish that zeus granted him readily
because of this , athena , who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles , cast her pebbles away in displeasure
however , apollo had committed a blood murder and had to be purified
because python was a child of gaia , gaia wanted apollo to be banished to tartarus as a punishment
zeus didnt agree and instead exiled his son from olympus , and instructed him to get purified
apollo had to serve as a slave for nine years
after the servitude was over , as per his fathers order , he travelled to the vale of tempe to bath in waters of peneus
there zeus himself performed purificatory rites on apollo
purified , apollo was escorted by his half sister athena to delphi where the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by gaia
according to a variation , apollo had also travelled to crete , where carmanor purified him
apollo later established the pythian games to appropriate gaia
henceforth , apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder and , made men aware of their guilt and purified them
soon after , zeus instructed apollo to go to delphi and establish his law
but apollo , disobeying his father , went to the land of hyperborea and stayed there for a year
he returned only after the delphians sang hymns to him and pleaded him to come back
zeus , pleased with his sons integrity , gave apollo the seat next to him on his right side
he also gave to apollo various gifts , like a golden tripod , a golden bow and arrows , a golden chariot and the city of delphi
soon after his return , apollo needed to recruit people to delphi
so , when he spotted a ship sailing from crete , he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin
the crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to delphi
there apollo revealed himself as a god
initiating them to his service , he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts
the pythia was apollos high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies
pythia is arguably the constant favorite of apollo among the mortals
hera once again sent another giant , tityos to rape leto
this time apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword
according to other version , artemis also aided him in protecting their mother by attacking tityos with her arrows
after the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus
there , he was pegged to the rock floor , covering an area of , where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver
admetus was the king of pherae , who was known for his hospitality
when apollo was exiled from olympus for killing python , he served as a herdsman under admetus , who was then young and unmarried
apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with admetus during his stay
callimachus , hymn ii to apollo
after completing his years of servitude , apollo went back to olympus as a god
because admetus had treated apollo well , the god conferred great benefits on him in return
apollos mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins
apollo helped admetus win the hand of alcestis , the daughter of king pelias , apollodorus , http / / www

by taming a lion and a boar to draw admetus chariot
he was present during their wedding to give his blessings
when admetus angered the goddess artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings , apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister
when apollo learnt of admetus untimely death , he convinced or tricked the fates into letting admetus live past his time
according to another version , or perhaps some years later , when zeus struck down apollos son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead , apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes , who had fashioned the bolt for zeus
apollodorus , http / / www
edu / hopper / textdocperseus3atext3a1999
apollo would have been banished to tartarus for this , but his mother leto intervened , and reminding zeus of their old love , pleaded him not to kill their son
zeus obliged and sentenced apollo to one year of hard labor once again under admetus
the fate of niobe was prophesied by apollo while he was still in letos womb
niobe was the queen of thebes and wife of amphion
she displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to leto because she had fourteen children ( niobids ) , seven male and seven female , while leto had only two
she further mocked apollos effeminate appearance and artemis manly appearance
leto , insulted by this , told her children to punish niobe
accordingly , apollo killed niobes sons , and artemis her daughters
according to some versions of the myth , among the niobids , chloris and her brother amyclas were not killed because they prayed to leto
amphion , at the sight of his dead sons , either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge
a devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept
her tears formed the river achelous
zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death , when the gods themselves entombed them
when chloris married and had children , apollo granted her son nestor the years he had taken away from the niobids
hence , nestor was able to live for 3 generations
once apollo and poseidon served under the trojan king laomedon in accordance to zeus words
apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris
apollo guarded the cattle of laomedon in the valleys of mount ida , while poseidon built the walls of troy
other versions make both apollo and poseidon the builders of the wall
in ovids account , apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre
in pindars odes , the gods took a mortal named aeacus as their assistant
when the work was completed , three snakes rushed against the wall , and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead , the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by aeacus
apollo immediately prophesied that troy would fall at the hands of aeacuss descendants , the aeacidae ( that is his son telamon joined heracles when he sieged the city during laomedons rule
later , his great - grandson neoptolemus was present in the wooden horse that lead to the downfall of troy )
however , the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised , but also threatened to bind their feet and hands , and sell them as slaves
angered by the unpaid labour and the insults , apollo infected the city with a pestilence and posedion sent the sea monster cetus
to deliver the city from it , laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter hesione ( who would later be saved by heracles )
during his stay in troy , apollo had a lover named ourea , who was a nymph and daughter of poseidon
together they had a son named ileus , whom apollo loved dearly
hesiod , catalogues of women fragment 83
during the war , the greek king agamemnon captured chryseis , the daughter of apollos priest chryses , and refused to return her
angered by this , apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment
he demanded that they return the girl , and the achaeans ( greeks ) complied , indirectly causing the anger of achilles , which is the theme of the iliad

marsyas argued against this , saying that apollo would have an advantage and accused apollo of cheating
but apollo replied that since marsyas played the flute , which needed air blown from the throat , it was similar to singing , and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all
the nymphs decided that apollos argument was just

cassandra , was a daughter of hecuba and priam
apollo wished to court her
cassandra promised to return his love on one condition - he should give her the power to see the future
apollo fulfilled her wish , but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after
angered that she broke her promise , apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future , no one would ever believe her prophecies
hestia , the goddess of the hearth , rejected both apollos and poseidons marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried
artemis as the sister of apollo , is thea apollousa , that is , she as a female divinity represented the same idea that apollo did as a male divinity
in the pre - hellenic period , their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife , and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described artemis as the wife of apollo
artemis , like her brother , is armed with a bow and arrows
she is the cause of sudden deaths of women
she also is the protector of the young , especially girls
though she has nothing to do with oracles , music or poetry , she sometimes led the female chorus on olympus while apollo sang
the laurel ( daphne ) was sacred to both
artemis daphnaia had her temple among the lacedemonians , at a place called hypsoi
apollo daphnephoros had a temple in eretria , a place where the citizens are to take the oaths
in later times when apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or helios , artemis was naturally regarded as selene or the moon
hecate , the goddess of witchcraft and magic , is the chthonic counterpart of apollo
they both are cousins , since their mothers - leto and asteria - are sisters
one of apollos epithets , hecatos , is the masculine form of hecate , and both the names mean working from afar
while apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven , hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness
if hecate is the gate - keeper , apollo agyieus is the door - keeper
hecate is the goddess of crossroads and apollo is the god and protector of streets
carol mooney , , hekate her role and character in greek literature from before the fifth century
the oldest evidence found for hecates worship is at apollos temple in miletos
there , hecate was taken to be apollos sister counterpart in the absence of artemis
hecates lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements , at the same time , apollos solar nature
as a deity of knowledge and great power , apollo was seen being the male counterpart of athena
being zeus favorite children , they were given more powers and duties
apollo and athena often took up the role as protectors of cities , and were patrons of some of the important cities
athena was the principle goddess of athens , apollo was the principle god of sparta
as patrons of arts , apollo and athena were companions of the muses , the former a much more frequent companion than the latter
apollo was sometimes called the son of athena and hephaestus
in the trojan war , as zeus executive , apollo is seen holding the aegis like athena usually does
apollos decisions were usually approved by his sister athena , and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by zeus
in aeschylus oresteia trilogy , clytemnestra kills her husband , king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war
apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnons son , orestes , is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus , her lover
orestes and pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes or furies ( female personifications of vengeance )
apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified ; apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father , whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage
they invade his temple , and he drives them away
he says that the matter should be brought before athena
apollo promises to protect orestes , as orestes has become apollos supplicant
apollo advocates orestes at the trial , and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo
the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks
there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus
on the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s bce , apollos first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields , replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinare
during the second punic war in 212 bce , the ludi apollinares ( apollonian games ) were instituted in his honor , on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marcius
in the time of augustus , who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son , his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome
after the battle of actium , which was fought near a sanctuary of apollo , augustus enlarged apollos temple , dedicated a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted quinquennial games in his honour
he also erected a new temple to the god on the palatine hill
sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games , held in 17 bce to celebrate the dawn of a new era
the chief apollonian festival was the pythian games held every four years at delphi and was one of the four great panhellenic games
also of major importance was the delia held every four years on delos
apollos most common attributes were the bow and arrow
other attributes of his included the kithara ( an advanced version of the common lyre ) , the plectrum and the sword
another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod , representing his prophetic powers
the pythian games were held in apollos honor every four years at delphi
the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games
the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos
animals sacred to apollo included wolves , dolphins , roe deer , swans , cicadas ( symbolizing music and song ) , ravens , hawks , crows ( apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers ) , snakes ( referencing apollos function as the god of prophecy ) , mice and griffins , mythical eagle–lion hybrids of eastern origin
homer and porphyry wrote that apollo had a hawk as his messenger

org / read / greeklit / tlg2034 / tlg003 / 1st1k - grc1 / 3 porphyry , de abstinentia , 3 in many myths apollo is transformed into a hawk
in addition , claudius aelianus wrote that in ancient egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god and that according to the ministers of apollo in egypt there were certain men called hawk - keepers ( ἱερακοβοσκοί ) who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god
eusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of apollo in egypt and that the citys symbol is a man with a hawklike face ( horus )
claudius aelianus wrote that egyptians called apollo horus in their own language

as god of colonization , apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies , especially during the height of colonization , 750–550 bce
according to greek tradition , he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy
however , this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction hittite cuneiform texts mention an asia minor god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions , which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars
in this interpretation , apollos title of lykegenes can simply be read as born in lycia , which effectively severs the gods supposed link with wolves ( possibly a folk etymology )
in literary contexts , apollo represents harmony , order , and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus , god of wine , who represents ecstasy and disorder
the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian
however , the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers , and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea , he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus
this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase
apollo is often associated with the golden mean
this is the greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony
apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance
the earliest greek word for a statue is delight (
the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity
the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health , and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment
the statues of apollo embody beauty , balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world
numerous free - standing statues of male youths from archaic greece exist , and were once thought to be representations of apollo , though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals
in 1895 , i
leonardos proposed the term kouros ( male youth ) to refer to those from keratea ; this usage was later expanded by henri lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format
the earliest examples of life - sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos
such statues were found across the greek speaking world , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios , boeotia alone
significantly more rare are the life - sized bronze statues
one of the few originals which survived into the present day—so rare that its discovery in 1959 was described as a miracle by ernst homann - wedeking—is the masterpiece bronze , piraeus apollo
it was found in piraeus , a port city close to athens , and is believed to have come from north - eastern peloponnesus
it is the only surviving large - scale peloponnesian statue
the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type , in which the god holds the cithara , a sophisticated seven - stringed variant of the lyre , in his left arm
while none of the greek originals have survived , several roman copies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist
apollo as a handsome beardless young man , is often depicted with a cithara ( as apollo citharoedus ) or bow in his hand , or reclining on a tree ( the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types )
the apollo belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century ; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans , from the renaissance through the 19th century
the marble is a hellenistic or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares , made between 350 and 325 bce
the life - size so - called adonis found in 1780 on the site of a villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars
in the late 2nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem , roman thysdrus , he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo , though now even a gods divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak , a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire
another haloed apollo in mosaic , from hadrumentum , is in the museum at sousse
the conventions of this representation , head tilted , lips slightly parted , large - eyed , curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck , were developed in the 3rd century bce to depict alexander the great
some time after this mosaic was executed , the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed
apollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of music , dance and poetry
apollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture
percy bysshe shelley composed a hymn of apollo ( 1820 ) , and the gods instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinskys apollon musagète ( 1927–1928 )
in 1978 , the canadian band rush released an album with songs apollo bringer of wisdom / dionysus bringer of love
apollo been portrayed in modern literature , such as when charles handy , in gods of management ( 1978 ) uses greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organizational culture
apollo represents a role culture where order , reason , and bureaucracy prevail
2018 , 2019 and 2020
apollo has been depicted in modern films—for instance , by keith david in the 1997 animated feature film hercules , and by dimitri lekkos in the 2010 film percy jackson the olympians the lightning thief
apollo has appeared in many modern video games
apollo appears as a minor character in santa monica studios 2010 action - adventure game god of war iii with his bow being used by peirithous
in philosophical discussion of the arts , a distinction is sometimes made between the apollonian and dionysian impulses , where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity
friedrich nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable
psychologist carl jungs apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over - intellectualise and maintain emotional distance
in spaceflight , the 1960s and 1970s nasa program for orbiting and landing astronauts on the moon was named after apollo , by nasa manager abe silverstein
apollo riding his chariot across the sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program

agassi had a poor start to 2006 , as he was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play
agassi withdrew from the australian open because of the ankle injury , and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events , eventually skipping the entire clay - court season including the french open

agassi returned for the grass - court season , playing a tune - up , and then wimbledon
he was defeated in the third round by world no
2 ( and eventual runner - up ) rafael nadal
against conventions , agassi , the losing player , was interviewed on court after the match
at wimbledon , agassi announced his plans to retire following the us open

with both sampras and agassi participating , the us won the davis cup in 1995
the year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won three out of four major titles , meeting each other twice in the finals , and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year
they met five times during the year , all in the title matches , including the australian open , the newsweek champions cup ( now indian wells ) , the lipton international players championships ( now miami open ) , the canadian open , and the us open
agassi won three of the finals , including the australian open ; however , sampras took the us open title , ending agassis 26 - match winning streak
after agassi had taken most of the fall season off , sampras took over the no
1 ranking for the end of the season
in the following three years , while sampras continued winning grand slam titles every season , agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions
the next time sampras and agassi met in a grand slam final was at wimbledon in 1999 , where sampras won in straight sets
for both , it was considered a career rejuvenation , as sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in the previous year while agassi was regaining his status as a top - ranked player after winning the french open
sampras forfeited the no
1 ranking to agassi when injury forced him to withdraw from that years us open , which agassi went on to win
they faced each other twice in the season - ending atp tour world championships , with sampras losing the round - robin match , but winning the final
in the 2000s , they met three more times on the grand slam level offering three memorable contests
in 2000 , the top - ranked agassi defeated no
3 sampras in the semi - finals of the australian open in five sets , which was an important win for agassi who had lost 4 of the previous five matches against sampras
in arguably their most memorable match ever , sampras defeated agassi in the 2001 us open quarterfinals in four sets
there were no breaks of serve during the entire match
reruns of the match are frequently featured on television , especially during us open rain delays , and the match is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players
their last meeting was the final of the 2002 us open , which was their third meeting in a us open final , but the first since 1995
the match was also notable because they had defeated several up - and - coming players en route to the final
sampras had defeated no
3 tommy haas in the fourth round and future no
1 andy roddick in the quarterfinals , while agassi had defeated no
1 and defending champion lleyton hewitt in the semi - finals
sampras defeated agassi in four sets
this was the final atp tour singles match of samprass career
michael chang was the opponent agassi faced most frequently from all the players other than sampras
they met 22 times on the tour level with agassi leading 15–7
chang , unlike most of agassis big rivals , had a playing style similar to his
both players preferred to stay at the baseline with chang being more defensive - minded
the outcome was that most of their meetings were built on long and entertaining rallies
the rivalry began late in the 1980s with both players being considered the prodigies of the next great generation of american tennis players and both having foreign descent
agassi won the first four matches including a straight - set victory in round 16 of the 1988 us open and defeating chang , the defending champion , in the 1990 french open in a four - set quarterfinal
arguably their best match took place in the round of 16 of the 1994 us open
while both players presented high - quality shot - making , the momentum changed from set to set with agassi eventually prevailing in a five - set victory
it turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first us open title
their next two grand slam meetings came in 1996 , with chang recording easy straight - set victories in the semi - finals of both the australian open and the us open
years after , agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on purpose as he did not want to face boris becker , who was awaiting the winner in the final
agassi won the last four of their matches , with the last being in 2003 at the miami open with chang being clearly past his prime
boris becker and agassi played 14 times with agassi leading 10–4
becker won their first three matches in 1988 and 1989 before agassi reversed the rivalry in 1990 , and won 10 of their last 11 matches
they first played at indian wells in 1988 , with becker prevailing
their most notable match was the 1989 davis cup semi - final match , which becker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks
agassi , considered a baseliner with a playing style not suiting grass , shocked becker , a three - time champion , in a five - set quarterfinal at wimbledon in 1992 on his way to his first grand slam title
the intensity of the rivalry peaked in 1995
becker won that years wimbledon semi - final after being down a set and two breaks , to eventually win in four sets
in a highly anticipated rematch in the us open semi - final , this time it was agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets
their final match was played at hong kong in 1999 , which agassi won in three sets
agassi and pat rafter played fifteen times with agassi leading 10–5
the rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters , because of the players contrasting styles of play , with rafter using traditional serve - - volley methods against agassis variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons
agassi led 8–2 on hard courts , but rafter surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the 1999 rome masters
they played four matches at wimbledon with both winning two matches each
agassi won the first two in 1993 and 1999 , while rafter took their 2000 and 2001 encounters , both of the gruelling 5 - setters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played
agassi also won both their meetings at the australian open , in 1995 and 2001 , on his way to the title on both occasions
rafter , however , took their only us open encounter in 1997 and went on to win the title
agassi and roger federer played 11 times , and federer led their head - to - head series 8–3
with the retirement of sampras , the rivalry against the 11 - years - younger federer , who was another great server like sampras , became agassis main rivalry for the final years of his career
agassi won their first three matches , but then went on to lose eight consecutive ones
they first met in just the third tournament of federers career at the 1998 swiss indoors in federers hometown , with agassi prevailing over the 17 - year - old
agassi also defeated federer at the 2001 us open and the finals of the miami open in 2002
federer began to turn the tide at the masters cup in 2003 , when he defeated agassi in both the round - robin and the final
they played a memorable quarterfinal match at the 2004 us open that spanned over two windy days , with federer eventually prevailing in five sets
at the 2005 dubai championships , federer and agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel burj al - arab
their final duel took place in the final of the 2005 us open
in the historic clash of generations , federer was victorious in four sets in front of a pro - agassi crowd
the match was the last appearance by agassi in any tournament final
agassi earned more than 30million in prize - money during his career , sixth only to djokovic , federer , nadal , sampras and murray to date ( may 2018 )
he also earned more than 25million a year through endorsements during his career , which was ranked fourth in all sports at the time

in 2009 , in macau agassi and sampras met for the first time on court since the 2002 us open final
sampras won the exhibition in three sets
agassi and sampras met again one year later for an exhibition match at madison square garden in new york in front of 19 000 spectators as sampras defeated agassi in two sets
he returned to the tour in may 2017 in the position of coach to novak djokovic for the french open
early in his career , agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first - strike tennis , typically by inducing a weak return with a deep , hard shot , and then playing a winner at an extreme angle
on the rare occasion that he charged the net , agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner
his favored groundstroke was his flat , accurate two - handed backhand , hit well cross - court but especially down the line
his forehand was nearly as strong , especially his inside - out to the ad court
agassis strength was in dictating play from the baseline , and he was able to consistently take the ball on the rise
while he was growing up , his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this way
open andre agassi harperscollins 2009 when in control of a point , agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors , and to make his opponent run more
this change to more methodical , less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach , brad gilbert , in their first year together in 1994
gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep , flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars , and noted agassis two - handed backhand down the line as his very best shot
a signature play later in his career was a change - up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes
this would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it
agassi was raised on hardcourts , but found much of his early major - tournament success on the red clay of roland garros , reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career
despite grass being his worst surface , his first major win was at the slick grass of wimbledon in 1992 , a tournament that he professed to hating at the time
his strongest surface over the course of his career , was indeed hardcourt , where he won six of his eight majors

agassi has also been called one of the greatest service returners ever to play the game , and was described by the bbc upon his retirement as perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sports history
as a result , he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s
the austroasiatic languages , also known as mon–khmer of these languages , only vietnamese , khmer , and mon have a long - established recorded history
only two have official status as modern national languages vietnamese in vietnam and khmer in cambodia
the mon language is a recognized indigenous language in myanmar and thailand
in myanmar , the wa language is the de facto official language of wa state
santali is one of the 22 scheduled languages of india
the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status
ethnologue identifies 168 austroasiatic languages
these form thirteen established families ( plus perhaps shompen , which is poorly attested , as a fourteenth ) , which have traditionally been grouped into two , as mon–khmer , and munda
however , one recent classification posits three groups ( munda , mon - khmer , and khasi–khmuic ) , while another has abandoned mon–khmer as a taxon altogether , making it synonymous with the larger family
austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across southeast asia and parts of india , bangladesh , nepal and east asia , separated by regions where other languages are spoken
they appear to be the extant original languages of mainland southeast asia ( excluding the andaman islands ) , with the neighboring , and sometimes surrounding , kra–dai , hmong - mien , austronesian , and sino - tibetan languages being the result of later migrations
the name austroasiatic comes from a combination of the latin words for south and asia , hence south asia
regarding word structure , austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic sesquisyllabic pattern , with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial , unstressed , reduced minor syllable followed by a stressed , full syllable
as for word formation , most austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes , many have infixes , but suffixes are almost completely non - existent in most branches except munda , and a few specialized exceptions in other austroasiatic branches
the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast , either between modal ( normal ) voice and breathy ( lax ) voice or between modal voice and creaky voice
languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have a three - or even four - way voicing contrast
however , some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases , such as vietnamese , tonogenesis
vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages , whereas khmer , which had more influence from sanskrit , has retained a more typically austroasiatic structure
much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto - mon–khmer in harry shortos mon–khmer comparative dictionary
little work has been done on the munda languages , which are not well documented
with their demotion from a primary branch , proto - mon–khmer becomes synonymous with proto - austroasiatic
paul sidwell ( 2005 ) reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto - mon–khmer as follows
this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for is better preserved in the katuic languages , which sidwell has specialized in
linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the mon–khmer languages of southeast asia , northeast india and the nicobar islands , and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh , parts of nepal
however , no evidence for this classification has ever been published
each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade
by contrast , the relationships between these families within austroasiatic are debated
in addition to the traditional classification , two recent proposals are given , neither of which accepts traditional mon–khmer as a valid unit
however , little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published , and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review
in addition , there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra ( diffloth ) , the chamic languages of vietnam , and the land dayak languages of borneo ( adelaar 1995 )
diffloths widely cited original classification , now abandoned by diffloth himself , is used in encyclopædia britannica and—except for the breakup of southern mon–khmer—in ethnologue
peiros is a lexicostatistic classification , based on percentages of shared vocabulary
this means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact
indeed , when sidwell ( 2009 ) replicated peiross study with languages known well enough to account for loans , he did not find the internal ( branching ) structure below
diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades , and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations , though like other classifications the evidence has not been published
as a schematic , we have
vieto - katuic languages sidwell ( 2005 ) casts doubt on diffloths vieto - katuic hypothesis , saying that the evidence is ambiguous , and that it is not clear where katuic belongs in the family
vietic 10 languages of vietnam and laos , including the vietnamese language , which has the most speakers of any austroasiatic language
paul sidwell ( 2009 ) , in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are well known enough to exclude loanwords , finds little evidence for internal branching , though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages , such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches , without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic
he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence
sidwell blench ( 2011 ) discuss this proposal in more detail , and note that there is good evidence for a khasi–palaungic node , which could also possibly be closely related to khmuic

if this would the case , sidwell blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward
sidwell blench ( 2011 ) suggest shompen as an additional branch , and believe that a vieto - katuic connection is worth investigating
in general , however , the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed , since proto - austroasiatic speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly
subsequently , sidwell ( 2015a 179 ) proposed that nicobarese subgroups with aslian , just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each other
a subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis ( sidwell 2015b ) suggests that austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake - like structure , with an east–west division ( consisting of munda , khasic , palaungic , and khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches ) occurring possibly as early as 7 , 000 years before present
however , he still considers the subbranching dubious

further expanded his mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into indochina from the lingnan area of southern china , with the subsequent mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of neolithic farmers from southern china
sidwell ( 2015c ) tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5 , 000 years during the neolithic transition era of mainland southeast asia , with all the major branches of austroasiatic formed by 4 , 000 austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the pearl river watershed of lingnan , which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of vietnam , or downstream through the mekong river via yunnan
both the reconstructed lexicon of proto - austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early austroasiatic speakers around 4 , 000 cultivated rice and millet , kept livestock such as dogs , pigs , and chickens , and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments
at 4 , 500 , this neolithic package suddenly arrived in indochina from the lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre - neolithic hunter - gatherer cultures , with grain husks found in northern indochina by 4 , 100 and in southern indochina by 3 , 800 however , sidwell ( 2015c ) found that iron is not reconstructable in proto - austroasiatic , since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from tai , chinese , tibetan , malay , and other languages
during the iron age about 2 , 500 , relatively young austroasiatic branches in indochina such as vietic , katuic , pearic , and khmer were formed , while the more internally diverse bahnaric branch ( dating to about 3 , 000 ) underwent more extensive internal diversification
by the iron age , all of the austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present - day locations , with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking place during the iron age
paul sidwell ( 2018 ) considers the austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4 , 000 years during the arrival of rice agriculture in indochina , but notes that the origin of proto - austroasiatic itself is older than that date
the lexicon of proto - austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum
the early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts , animal names , natural features , and pronouns , while the names of cultural items ( agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts , which are reconstructible in proto - austroasiatic ) form part of the later stratum

presented at icaal 7 , kiel , germany

blench ( 2017 ) finds widespread austroasiatic roots for river , valley , boat , fish , catfish sp
, eel , prawn , shrimp ( central austroasiatic ) , crab , tortoise , turtle , otter , crocodile , heron , fishing bird , and fish trap
archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern indochina ( northern vietnam , laos , and other nearby areas ) dates back to only about 4 , 000 years ago ( 2 , 000 bc ) , with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6 , 000

( https / / www
com / watchvqreb1uttwti video ) proposes that the locus of proto - austroasiatic was in the red river delta area about 4 , 000 - 4 , 500 years before present , instead of the middle mekong as he had previously proposed
austroasiatic dispersed coastal maritime routes and also upstream through river valleys
khmuic , palaungic , and khasic resulted from a westward dispersal that ultimately came from the red valley valley
based on their current distributions , about half of all austroasiatic branches ( including nicobaric and munda ) can be traced to coastal maritime dispersals
hence , this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to sino - tibetan , whose speakers had a distinct non - riverine culture
in addition to living an aquatic - based lifestyle , early austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock , crops , and newer types of watercraft
as early austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways , they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area , such as sino - tibetan
sidwell ( 2018 ) ( quoted in sidwell 2021 ) gives a more nested classification of austroasiatic branches as suggested by his computational phylogenetic analysis of austroasiatic languages using a 200 - word list
many of the tentative groupings are likely linkages
pakanic and shompen were not included
roger blench ( 2009 ) also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of austroasiatic that are now extinct , based on substrate evidence in modern - day languages
john peterson ( 2017 ) suggests that pre - munda ( proto - in regular terminology ) languages may have once dominated the eastern indo - gangetic plain , and were then absorbed by indo - aryan languages at an early date as indo - aryan spread east
peterson notes that eastern indo - aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of munda languages , while western indo - aryan languages do not
other than latin - based alphabets , many austroasiatic languages are written with the khmer , thai , lao , and burmese alphabets
vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on chinese logographic writing
this has since been supplanted by the latin alphabet in the 20th century
the following are examples of past - used alphabets or current alphabets of austroasiatic languages
austroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial austric hypothesis , which also includes the austronesian languages , and in some proposals also the kra–dai languages and the hmong–mien languages
several lexical resemblances are found between the hmong - mien and austroasiatic language families ( ratliff 2010 ) , some of which had earlier been proposed by haudricourt ( 1951 )
this could imply a relation or early language contact along the yangtze
according to cai ( and others 2011 ) , hmong–mien is at least partially related to austroasiatic but was heavily influenced by sino - tibetan , especially tibeto - burman languages
it is suggested that the austroasiatic languages have some influence on indo - aryan languages including sanskrit and middle indo - aryan languages
indian linguist suniti kumar chatterji pointed that a specific number of substantives in languages such as hindi , punjabi and bengali were borrowed from munda languages
additionally , french linguist jean przyluski suggested a similarity between the tales from the austroasiatic realm and the indian mythological stories of matsyagandha ( from mahabharata ) and the nāgas
mitsuru sakitani suggests that haplogroup o1b1 , which is common in austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in southern china , and haplogroup o1b2 , which is common in today japanese , koreans and some manchu , are the carriers of early rice - agriculturalists from indochina
another study suggests that the haplogroup o1b1 is the major austroasiatic paternal lineage and o1b2 the para - austroasiatic lineage of the mandchurian , korean and yayoi people
a 2021 study by tagore and others found that the proto - austroasiatic speakers split from an basal east asian source population , native to mainland southeast asia and northeast india , which also gave rise to other east asian - related populations , including northeast asians and indigenous peoples of the americas
the proto - austroasiatic speakers can be linked to the hoabinhian material culture
from mainland southeast asia , the austroasiatic speakers expanded into the indian - subcontinent and maritime southeast asia
there is evidence that later back migration from more northerly east asian groups ( such as kra - dai speakers ) merged with indigenous southeast asians , contributing to the fragmentation observed among modern day austroasiatic - speakers
in the indian subcontinent , austroasiatic speakers , specifically mundari , intermixed with the local population
furthermore they concluded that their results do not support a genetic relationship between ancient southeast asian hunter - gatherers ( hoabinhians ) with papuan - related groups , as previously suggested by mccoll and others 2018 , but that these ancient southeast asians are characterized by basal east asian ancestry
the authors finally concluded that genetics do not necessarily correspond with linguistic identity , pointing to the fragmentation of modern austroasiatic speakers
larena and others 2021 could reproduce the genetic evidence for the origin of basal east asians in mainland southeast asia , which are estimated to have formed about 50kya years ago , and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards
early austroasiatic speakers are estimated to have originated from an lineage , which split from ancestral east asians between 25 , 000 to 15 , 000 years ago , and were among the first wave to replace distinct australasian - related groups in insular southeast asia
east asian - related ancestry became dominant in insular southeast asia already between 15 , 000 years to 12 , 000 years ago , and may be associated with austroasiatic groups , which however got again replaced by later austronesian groups some 10 , 000 to 7 , 000 years ago
early austroasiatic people were found to be best represented by the mlabri people in modern day thailand
proposals for austroasiatic substratum among later austronesian languages in western indonesia , noteworthy among the dayak languages , is strengthened by genetic data , suggesting austroasiatic speakers were assimilated by austronesian speakers
a study in november 2021 ( guo and others ) found that modern east - eurasians can be modeled from four ancestry components , which descended from a common ancestor in mainland southeast asia , one being the ancestral austroasiatic component ( aaa ) , which is more prevalent among modern southeast asians , and making up the exclusive ancestry among austroasiatic - speaking lua and mlabri people
the early austroasiatic speakers are suggested to have been hunter - gatherers but became rice - agriculturalists quite early , spreading from mainland southeast asia northwards to the yangtze river , westwards into the indian subcontinent , and southwards into insular southeast asia
evidence for these migrations are austroasiatic loanwords related to rice - agriculture found among non - austroasiatic languages , and the presence of austroasiatic genetic ancestry
according to a recent genetic study , sundanese , javanese , and balinese , has almost an equal ratio of genetic marker shared between austronesian and austroasiatic heritages
according to chaubey and others , austro - asiatic speakers in india today are derived from dispersal from southeast asia , followed by extensive sex - specific admixture with local indian populations
according to zhang and others , austroasiatic migrations from southeast asia into india took place after the last glacial maximum , circa 10 , 000 years ago
the afroasiatic languages ( or afro - asiatic ) , also known as hamito - semitic , , p
545 and sometimes also as afrasian or erythraean , with the exception of its semitic branch , all other branches of the afroаsiatic family are spoken exclusively on the african continent
afroasiatic languages have over 500 million native speakers , which is the fourth - largest number of native speakers of any language family ( after indo - european , sino - tibetan , and niger–congo )
the most widely spoken modern afroasiatic language or dialect continuum by far is arabic , a de facto group of distinct language varieties within the semitic branch
the languages that evolved from proto - arabic have around 313 million native speakers , concentrated primarily in the middle east and north africa
in addition to the languages spoken today , afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages , such as egyptian , which forms a distinct branch of the family ; and within the semitic family , akkadian , biblical hebrew , and old aramaic
while there is no consensus among historical linguists concerning the original homeland of the afroasiatic family or the period when the parent language ( that is proto - afroasiatic ) was spoken , most agree that it was located within a region of northeast africa
proposed specific locations include the horn of africa , egypt , the eastern sahara , and the levant
in the early 19th century , linguists grouped the berber , cushitic and egyptian languages within a hamitic phylum , in acknowledgement of these languages genetic relation with each other and with those in the semitic phylum
the terms hamitic and semitic were etymologically derived from the book of genesis , which describes various biblical tribes descended from ham and shem , two sons of noah
friedrich müller introduced the name hamito - semitic for the entire language family in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft ( 1876 )
individual scholars have also called the family erythraean ( tucker 1966 ) and lisramic ( hodge 1972 )
in lieu of hamito - semitic , the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term afrasian , meaning half african , half asiatic , in reference to the geographic distribution of the familys constituent languages
scholars generally treat the afroasiatic language family as including at least the following five branches
although there is general agreement on these six families , linguists who study afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement , in particular
in the 9th century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret in algeria became the first to link two branches of afroasiatic together ; he perceived a relationship between berber and semitic
he knew of semitic through his study of arabic , hebrew , and aramaic
in the same year newman suggested a relationship between semitic and hausa , but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty
friedrich müller named the traditional hamito - semitic family in 1876 in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft ( outline of linguistics ) , and defined it as consisting of a semitic group plus a hamitic group containing egyptian , berber , and cushitic ; he excluded the chadic group
in 1912 , carl meinhof published die sprachen der hamiten ( the languages of the hamites ) , in which he expanded lepsiuss model , adding the fula , maasai , bari , nandi , sandawe and hadza languages to the hamitic group
meinhofs model was widely supported in the 1940s
however , in the case of the so - called nilo - hamitic languages ( a concept he introduced ) , it was based on the typological feature of gender and a fallacious theory of language mixture
meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub nilo - hamitic were in fact nilotic languages , with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other nilotic languages
leo reinisch ( 1909 ) had already proposed linking cushitic and chadic while urging their more distant affinity with egyptian and semitic
however , his suggestion found little acceptance
marcel cohen ( 1924 ) rejected the idea of a distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa ( a chadic language ) in his comparative hamito - semitic vocabulary
finally , joseph greenbergs 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of hamitic as a language category by linguists
greenberg refuted meinhofs linguistic theories and rejected the use of racial and social evidence
in dismissing the notion of a separate nilo - hamitic language category , in particular , greenberg was returning to a view widely held a half - century earlier
he consequently rejoined meinhofs so - called nilo - hamitic languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings
he also added ( and sub - classified ) the chadic languages , and proposed a new name , afroasiatic , for the family
almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus
greenberg developed his model fully in his book the languages of africa ( 1963 ) , in which he reassigned most of meinhofs additions to hamitic to other language families , notably nilo - saharan
following isaac schapera and rejecting meinhof , he classified the khoekhoe language as a member of the khoisan languages , a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of click sounds
since the three traditional branches of the hamitic languages ( berber , cushitic and egyptian ) have not been shown to form an exclusive ( monophyletic ) phylogenetic unit of their own , separate from other afroasiatic languages , linguists no longer use the term in this sense
each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger afroasiatic family
in 1969 , harold fleming proposed that what had previously been known as western cushitic is an independent branch of afroasiatic , suggesting for it the new name omotic
this proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance
based on typological differences with the other cushitic languages , robert hetzron proposed that beja has to be removed from cushitic , thus forming an independent branch of afroasiatic
glottolog does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of omotic has been established , nor that of ongota or the unclassified kujarge
it therefore splits off the following groups as small families south omotic , mao , dizoid , gonga–gimojan ( north omotic apart from the preceding ) , ongota , and kujarge
little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of afroasiatic semitic , egyptian , berber , chadic , cushitic , and omotic
however , christopher ehret ( 1979 ) , harold fleming ( 1981 ) , and joseph greenberg ( 1981 ) all agree that the omotic branch split from the rest first
the earliest written evidence of an afroasiatic language is an ancient egyptian inscription dated to c
3400 bc ( 5 , 400 years ago )
and considerable time must have elapsed in between them
estimates of the date at which the proto - afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely
they fall within a range between approximately 7500 bc ( 9 , 500 years ago ) , and approximately 16 , 000 bc ( 18 , 000 years ago )
according to igor diakonoff ( 1988 33n ) , proto - afroasiatic was spoken c
10 , 000 bc
christopher ehret ( 2002 35–36 ) asserts that proto - afroasiatic was spoken c
11 , 000 bc at the latest , and possibly as early as c
16 , 000 bc
these dates are older than those associated with other proto - languages
the afroasiatic urheimat , the hypothetical place where proto - afroasiatic language speakers lived in a single linguistic community , or complex of communities , before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages , is unknown
afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in west asia , north africa , the horn of africa , and parts of the sahel
their distribution seems to have been influenced by the sahara pump operating over the last 10 , 000 years
while there is no definitive agreement on when or where the original homeland of this language family existed , some link the first speakers to the first farmers in the levant who would later spread to north and east africa
an indigenous african origin in northeast africa is supported by linguistic and archaeogenetic data , but not undisputed
this region includes the majority of the diversity of the afroasiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity , sometimes considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin
roger blench has proposed southwestern ethiopia as the most likely urheimat of the afroasiatic language due to the high internal diversification of the omotic branch spoken in that region
this omotic - related ancestry makes up 6 of the ancient natufian ancestry , and may be associated with the spread of proto - afroasiatic and the specific y - haplogroup sublineage e - m215 , also known as e1b1b , which is common among modern afroasiatic - speaking groups and likely arose in northeast africa
one of the most remarkable shared features among the afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation ( see the table at right ) , with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with / ʔ t n j / , and in particular a pattern whereby third - singular masculine / j - / is opposed to third - singular feminine and second - singular / t - /
according to ehret ( 1996 ) , tonal languages appear in the omotic and chadic branches of afroasiatic , as well as in certain cushitic languages
the semitic , berber and egyptian branches generally do not use tones phonemically
the berber and semitic branches share certain grammatical features ( for example alternative feminine endings - ay / - āy ; corresponding vowel templates for verbal conjugations ) which can be reconstructed for a higher - order proto - language ( provisionally called proto - berbero - semitic by kossmann suchard ( 2018 ) and putten ( 2018 ) )
whether this proto - language is ancestral to berber and semitic only , or also to other branches of afroasiatic , still remains to be established
the following are some examples of afroasiatic cognates , including ten pronouns , three nouns , and three verbs
source christopher ehret , reconstructing proto - afroasiatic ( berkeley university of california press , 1995 )
note ehret does not make use of berber in his etymologies , stating ( 1995 12 ) the kind of extensive reconstruction of proto - berber lexicon that might help in sorting through alternative possible etymologies is not yet available
the berber cognates here are taken from the previous version of the table in this article and need to be completed and referenced

there are two etymological dictionaries of afroasiatic , one by christopher ehret , and one by vladimir orel and olga stolbova
the two dictionaries disagree on almost everything
the following table contains the thirty roots or so ( out of thousands ) that represent a fragile consensus of present research
andorra is the sixth - smallest state in europe , with an area of
andorra is the worlds 16th - smallest country by land and 11th - smallest by population
tourism in andorra sees an estimated 10 million visitors annually
in 2013 , andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world at 81 years , according to the global burden of disease study ;
the origin of the word andorra is unknown , although several hypotheses have been formulated
the oldest derivation is from the greek historian polybius ( the histories iii , 35 , 1 ) , who describes the andosins , an iberian pre - roman tribe , as historically located in the valleys of andorra and facing the carthaginian army in its passage through the pyrenees during the punic wars
the word andosini or andosins ( , meaning big or giant
diccionari dhistòria de catalunya ; ed
62 ; barcelona ; 1998 ; ( water )
another theory suggests that andorra may derive from in arabic means a vast land which is located among mountains
other theories suggest that the term derives from the navarro - aragonese andurrial , which means land covered with bushes or scrubland
the folk etymology holds that charlemagne had named the region as a reference to the biblical canaanite valley of endor or andor ( where the midianites had been defeated ) , a name bestowed by his heir and son louis the pious after defeating the moors in the wild valleys of hell
la balma de la margineda , found by archaeologists at sant julià de lòria , was settled in 9 , 500 bc as a passing place between the two sides of the pyrenees
the seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter - gatherers from ariege and segre
during the neolithic age , a group of people moved to the valley of madriu ( the present - day natural parc located in escaldes - engordany declared unesco world heritage site ) as a permanent camp in 6640 bc
the population of the valley grew cereals , raised domestic livestock , and developed a commercial trade with people from the segre and occitania
other archaeological deposits include the tombs of segudet ( ordino ) and feixa del moro ( sant julià de lòria ) , both dated in 4900–4300 bc as an example of the urn culture in andorra
the model of small settlements began to evolve to a complex urbanism during the bronze age
metallurgical items of iron , ancient coins , and relicaries can be found in the ancient sanctuaries scattered around the country
the sanctuary of roc de les bruixes ( stone of the witches ) is perhaps the most important archeological complex of this age in andorra , located in the parish of canillo , about the rituals of funerals , ancient scripture and engraved stone murals
the inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the iberians and historically located in andorra as the iberian tribe andosins or andosini (
some of the most significant remains of this era are the castle of the roc denclar ( part of the early marca hispanica ) ,
the presence of roman influence is recorded from the 2nd century bc to the 5th century ad
the places with the most roman presence are in camp vermell ( red field ) in sant julià de lòria , and in some places in encamp , as well as in the roc denclar
people continued trading , mainly with wine and cereals , with the roman cities of urgellet ( the present - day la seu durgell ) and all across segre through the via romana strata ceretana ( also known as strata confluetana )
after the fall of the roman empire , andorra came under the influence of the visigoths , the kingdom of toledo , and the diocese of urgell
the visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 years , during which time christianity spread
when the muslim empire of al - andalus replaced the ruling visigoths in most of the iberian peninsula , andorra was sheltered from these invaders by the franks
tradition holds that charles the great ( charlemagne ) granted a charter to the andorran people for a contingent of 5 , 000 soldiers under the command of marc almugaver , in return for fighting against the moors near porté - puymorens ( cerdanya )
andorra remained part of the frankish marca hispanica , the buffer zone between the frankish empire and the muslim territories , andorra being part of the territory ruled by the count of urgell and eventually the bishop of the diocese of urgell
tradition also holds that it was guaranteed by the son of charlemagne , louis the pious , writing the carta de poblament or a local municipal charter circa 805
in 988 , borrell ii , count of urgell , gave the andorran valleys to the diocese of urgell in exchange for land in cerdanya
the first document that mentions andorra as a territory is the acta de consagració i dotació de la catedral de la seu durgell ( deed of consecration and endowment of the cathedral of la seu durgell )
the document , dated 839 , depicts the six old parishes of the andorran valleys that made up the countrys administrative division
before 1095 , andorra had no military protection , and the bishop of urgell , who knew that the count of urgell wanted to reclaim the andorran valleys , asked the lord of caboet for help and protection
in 1095 , the lord of caboet and the bishop of urgell signed under oath a declaration of their co - sovereignty over andorra
arnalda , daughter of arnau of caboet , married the viscount of castellbò
their daughter , ermessenda , married the count of foix , roger - bernard ii
roger - bernard ii and ermessenda shared rule over andorra with the bishop of urgell
in the 13th century , a military dispute arose between the bishop of urgell and the count of foix as aftermath of the cathar crusade
the conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the king of aragon , peter iii , between the bishop and the count , by the signing of the first paréage , which provided that andorras sovereignty be shared between the count of foix ( whose title would ultimately transfer to the french head of state ) and the bishop of urgell , in catalonia
this gave the principality its territory and political form
a second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the count of foix ordered the construction of a castle in roc denclar
the document was ratified by the noble notary jaume orig of puigcerdà , and construction of military structures in the country was prohibited
in 1364 , the political organization of the country named the figure of the syndic ( now spokesman and president of the parliament ) as representative of the andorrans to their co - princes , making possible the creation of local departments ( comuns , quarts and veïnats )
after being ratified by bishop francesc tovia and count john i , the consell de la terra or consell general de les valls ( general council of the valleys ) was founded in 1419 , the second oldest parliament in europe
the syndic andreu dalàs and the general council organized the creation of the justice courts ( la cort de justicia ) in 1433 with the co - princes and the collection of taxes like foc i lloc ( literally fire and site , a national tax active since then )
although there are remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century ( sant vicenç denclar or església de santa coloma ) , andorra developed exquisite romanesque art during the 9th through 14th centuries , particularly in the construction of churches , bridges , religious murals and statues of the virgin and child ( our lady of meritxell being the most important )
the catalan pyrenees were embryonic of the catalan language at the end of the 11th century
andorra was influenced by this language , which was adopted locally many years before it expanded to the rest of the crown of aragon
the local economy during the middle ages was based on livestock , agriculture , furs and weavers
later , at the end of the 11th century , the first iron foundries began to appear in northern parishes like ordino , much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges , an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century
in 1601 , the tribunal de corts ( high court of justice ) was created as a result of huguenot rebellions in france , inquisition courts coming from spain and witchcraft - related beliefs native to the area , in the context of the reformation and counter - reformation
with the passage of time , the co - title to andorra passed to the kings of navarre
after henry iii of navarre became king of france , he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the french state and the bishop of urgell as co - princes of andorra , a political arrangement that still holds
during 1617 , communal councils form the sometent ( popular militia or army ) to deal with the rise of bandolerisme ( brigandage ) and the consell de la terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition , organization and competences current today
andorra continued with the same economic system that it had during the 12th–14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy ( fargues , a system similar to farga catalana ) and with the introduction of tobacco circa 1692 and import trade
in 1371 , and 1448 , the co - princes ratified the fair of andorra la vella , the most important annual national festival commercially ever since
the country had a unique and experienced guild of weavers , confraria de paraires i teixidors , in escaldes - engordany
founded in 1604 , it took advantage of the local thermal waters
by this time , the country was characterized by the social system of prohoms ( wealthy society ) and casalers ( rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition ) , deriving from the tradition of pubilla and hereu
three centuries after its foundation , the consell de la terra located its headquarters and the tribunal de corts in casa de la vall in 1702
the manor house built in 1580 served as a noble fortress of the busquets family
inside the parliament was placed the closet of the six keys ( armari de les sis claus ) , representative of each andorran parish , where the andorran constitution and other documents and laws were later kept
in both the reapers war and the war of the spanish succession , the andorran people ( while professing to be a neutral country ) supported the catalans who saw their rights reduced in 1716
the reaction was the promotion of catalan writings in andorra , with cultural works such as the book of privileges ( llibre de privilegis de 1674 ) , manual digest ( 1748 ) by antoni fiter i rossell or the polità andorrà ( 1763 ) by antoni puig
after the french revolution , napoleon i reestablished the co - principate in 1809 and removed the french medieval title
in 1812–1813 , the first french empire annexed catalonia during the peninsular war (
during this period , andorras late medieval institutions and rural culture remained largely unchanged
in 1866 , the syndic guillem dareny - plandolit led the reformist group in a council general of 24 members elected by suffrage limited to heads of families
the council general replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state

the new reform ( and symbolsof andorra
a new service economy arose as a demand of the valley inhabitants and began to build infrastructure such as hotels , spa resorts , roads and telegraph lines
the authorities of the co - princes banned casinos and betting houses throughout the country
the ban resulted in an economic conflict and the revolution of 1881 , which began when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic on 8 december 1880 , and established the provisional revolutionary council led by joan pla i calvo and pere baró i mas
the provisional revolutionary council allowed for the construction of casinos and spas by foreign companies
after a day of combat the treaty of the bridge of escalls was signed on 10 june
– the andorran question in relation to the eastern question
andorra participated in the cultural movement of the catalan renaixença
between 1882 and 1887 , the first academic schools were formed where trilingualism coexisted with the official language , catalan
romantic authors from france and spain reported the awakening of the national consciousness of the country
jacint verdaguer lived in ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and shared works related to the renaixença with writer and photographer , joaquim de riba
in 1848 , fromental halévy had premiered the opera le val dandorre to great success in europe , where the national consciousness of the valleys was exposed in the romantic work during the peninsular war
in 1933 , france occupied andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections due to the revolution of 1933 and the fhasa strikes ( vagues de fhasa ) ; the revolt led by joves andorrans ( a labour union group related to the spanish cnt and fai ) called for political reforms , on 5 april 1933 joves andorrans seized the andorran parliament
on 6 july 1934 , adventurer and nobleman boris skossyreff , with his promise of freedoms and modernization of the country and wealth through the establishment of a tax haven and foreign investments , received the support of the members of the general council to proclaim himself the sovereign of andorra
on 8 july 1934 boris issued a proclamation in urgell , declaring himself boris i , king of andorra , he was arrested by the co - prince and bishop justí guitart i vilardebó and their authorities on 20 july and ultimately expelled from spain
and francoist spain during the spanish civil war , the inhabitants of andorra welcomed refugees from both sides , and many of them settled permanently in the country thus contributing to the subsequent economic boom and the entry into the capitalist era of andorra
francoist troops reached the andorran border in the later stages of the war
during world war ii , andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between vichy france and francoist spain , reducing the rights of citizens certain groups formed to help victims of oppression in nazi - occupied countries , while participating in smuggling to help andorra survive
among the most prominent was the hostal palanques evasion network command , which , in contact with the british mi6 , helped almost 400 fugitives ,
in the capital city there was a smuggling black market of propaganda , culture and cinematic art not favorable to totalitarian regimes , promulgated in such places as the hotel mirador or the casino hotel ,
the andorran opening to the capitalist economy resulted in two axes mass tourism and the countrys tax exemption
the first steps toward the capitalist boom date from the 1930s , with the construction of fhasa with banc agrícol ( 1930 ) and crèdit andorrà ( 1949 ) , later with banca mora ( 1952 ) , banca cassany ( 1958 ) and sobanca ( 1960 )
shortly after activities such as skiing and shopping become a tourist attraction , with the inauguration of ski resorts and cultural entities in the late 1930s
the andorran government necessarily involved planning , projection and forecasts for the future with the official visit of the french co - prince charles de gaulle in 1967 and 1969 , it was given approval for the economic boom and national demands within the framework of human rights and international openness
andorra lived an era commonly known as andorran dream with guests and speakers of great importance promoting musical hits of chanson française , swing , rhythm blues , jazz , rock and roll and american country music
given its relative isolation , andorra has existed outside the mainstream of european history , with few ties to countries other than france , spain and portugal
but in recent times its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation
since 1976 the country has seen the need to reform andorran institutions due to anachronisms in sovereignty , human rights and the balance of powers as well as the need to adapt legislation to modern demands
in 1982 , a first separation of powers took place when instituting the govern dandorra , under the name of executive board ( consell executiu ) , chaired by the first prime minister òscar ribas reig with the co - princes approval
its political system was modernized in 1993 after the andorran constitutional referendum , when the constitution was drafted by the co - princes and the general council and approved on 14 marchnohlen , stöver , ( 2010 ) elections in europe a data handbook , p
andorra formalized diplomatic relations with the united states in 1996 , participating in the 51st un general assembly
first general syndic marc forné took part on a speech in catalan in the general assembly to defend the reform of the organization , and after three days he took part in the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe to defend andorras linguistic rights and economy
andorra is a parliamentary co - principality with the president of france and the catholic bishop of urgell ( catalonia , spain ) as co - princes
this peculiarity makes the president of france , in his capacity as prince of andorra , an elected monarch , although he is not elected by a popular vote of the andorran people
the politics of andorra take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democracy with a unicameral legislature , and of a pluriform multi - party system
the head of government is the prime minister
the current head of government is xavier espot zamora of the democrats for andorra ( da )
executive power is exercised by the government
legislative power is vested in both government and parliament
the parliament of andorra is known as the general council
the general council consists of between 28 and 42 councillors
the councillors serve for four - year terms , and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous council
half are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes , and the other half of the councillors are elected in a single national constituency
fifteen days after the election , the councillors hold their inauguration
during this session , the syndic general , who is the head of the general council , and the subsyndic general , his assistant , are elected
eight days later , the council convenes once more
during this session the head of government is chosen from among the councillors
candidates can be proposed by a minimum of one - fifth of the councillors
the council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be head of government
the syndic general then notifies the co - princes , who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the head of government of andorra
the general council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws
bills may be presented to the council as private members bills by three of the local parish councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of andorra
the council also approves the annual budget of the principality
the government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires
if the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year , the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved
once any bill is approved , the syndic general is responsible for presenting it to the co - princes so that they may sign and enact it
if the head of government is not satisfied with the council , he may request that the co - princes dissolve the council and order new elections
in turn , the councillors have the power to remove the head of government from office
after a motion of censure is approved by at least one - fifth of the councillors , the council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes , the head of government is removed
the judiciary is composed of the magistrates court , the criminal law court , the high court of andorra , and the constitutional court
the high court of justice is composed of five judges one appointed by the head of government , one each by the co - princes , one by the syndic general , and one by the judges and magistrates
it is presided over by the member appointed by the syndic general and the judges hold office for six - year terms
the magistrates and judges are appointed by the high court , as is the president of the criminal law court
the high court also appoints members of the office of the attorney general
the constitutional court is responsible for interpreting the constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties
it is composed of four judges , one appointed by each of the co - princes and two by the general council
they serve eight - year terms the court is presided over by one of the judges on a two - year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the court
andorra does not have its own armed forces , although there is a small ceremonial army
responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with france and spain
on 16 october 2020 , andorra became the 190th member of the international monetary fund ( imf ) , during the covid - 19 pandemic
andorra has a small army , which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates , but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army
the basic principle of andorran defence is that all able - bodied men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the sometent
being a landlocked country , andorra has no navy
before world war i , andorra maintained an armed force of about 600 part - time militiamen under the supervision of a captain ( capità or cap de sometent ) and a lieutenant ( desener or lloctinent del capità )
this body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials ( veguers ) appointed by france and the bishop of urgell
in the modern era , the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties
uniforms and weaponry were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities
the armys role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the police corps of andorra in 1931
brief civil disorder associated with the elections of 1933 led to assistance being sought from the french national gendarmerie , the force consisted of six corporals , one for each parish ( although there are currently seven parishes , there were only six until 1978 ) , plus four junior staff officers to co - ordinate action , and a commander with the rank of major
it was the responsibility of the six corporals , each in his own parish , to be able to raise a fighting force from among the able - bodied men of the parish
today a small , twelve - man ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the sometent , but all able - bodied men remain technically available for military service ,
in more recent times there has only been a general emergency call to the popular army of sometent during the floods of 1982 in the catalan pyrenees ,
andorra maintains a small but modern and well - equipped internal police force , with around 240 police officers supported by civilian assistants
the principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing , criminal detection , border control , and traffic policing
there are also small specialist units including police dogs , mountain rescue , and a bomb disposal team
the grup dintervenció policia dandorra ( gipa ) is a small special forces unit trained in counter - terrorism , and hostage recovery tasks
although it is the closest in style to an active military force , it is part of the police corps , and not the army
as terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the country , the gipa is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties , and at other times to routine policing
the andorran fire brigade , with headquarters at santa coloma , operates from four modern fire stations , and has a staff of around 120 firefighters
the service is equipped with 16 heavy appliances ( fire tenders , turntable ladders , and specialist four - wheel drive vehicles ) , four light support vehicles ( cars and vans ) and four ambulances
historically , the families of the six ancient parishes of andorra maintained local arrangements to assist each other in fighting fires
the first fire pump purchased by the government was acquired in 1943
serious fires which lasted for two days in december 1959 led to calls for a permanent fire service , and the andorran fire brigade was formed on 21 april 1961
the fire service maintains full - time cover with five fire crews on duty at any time two at the brigades headquarters in santa coloma , and one crew at each of the other three fire stations
due to its location in the eastern pyrenees mountain range , andorra consists predominantly of rugged mountains , the highest being the coma pedrosa at
these are dissected by three narrow valleys in a y shape that combine into one as the main stream , the gran valira river leaves the country for spain ( at andorras lowest point of andorras land area is
phytogeographically , andorra belongs to the atlantic european province of the circumboreal region within the boreal kingdom
according to the wwf , the territory of andorra belongs to the ecoregion of pyrenees conifer and mixed forests
the whole country has been recognised as a single important bird area ( iba ) by birdlife international , because it is important for forest and mountain birds and supports populations of red - billed choughs , citril finches and rock buntings
andorra has alpine , continental and oceanic climates , depending on altitude
its higher elevation means there is , on average , more snow in winter and it is slightly cooler in summer
the diversity of landmarks , the different orientation of the valleys and the irregularity relief typical of the mediterranean climates make the country have a great diversity of microclimates that hinder the general dominance of the high mountain climate
the great differences of altitude in the minimum and maximum points , together with the influence of a mediterranean climate , develop the climate of the andorran pyrenees
when in precipitation , a global model characterized by convective and abundant rains can be defined during spring and summer , which can last until autumn ( may , june and august are usually the rainiest months )
in winter , however , it is less rainy , except in the highlands , subject to the influence of fronts from the atlantic , which explains the great amount of snowfall in the andorran mountains
the temperature regime is characterized , broadly , by a temperate summer and a long and cold winter , in accordance with the mountainous condition of the principality

tourism , the mainstay of andorras tiny , well - to - do economy , accounts for roughly 80 of gdp
an estimated 10million tourists visit annually , attracted by andorras duty - free status and by its summer and winter resorts
the banking sector , with its tax haven status , also contributes substantially to the economy with revenues raised exclusively through import tariffs ( the financial and insurance sector accounts for approximately 19 of gdp followed by a sales tax of 2 a year later , which raised just over 14 million euros in its first quarter
andorra is not a member of the european union , but enjoys a special relationship with it , such as being treated as an eu member for trade in manufactured goods ( no tariffs ) and as a non - eu member for agricultural products
andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the french franc and the spanish peseta in banking transactions until 31 december 1999 , when both currencies were replaced by the eus single currency , the euro
coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in andorra until 31 december 2002
andorra negotiated to issue its own euro coins , beginning in 2014
andorra has historically had one of the worlds lowest unemployment rates
in 2019 , it stood at 2
on 31 may 2013 , it was announced that andorra intended to legislate for the introduction of an income tax by the end of june , against a background of increasing dissatisfaction with the existence of tax havens among eu members
by the mid - 2010s , the financial system comprised five banking groups , one specialised credit entity , eight investment undertaking management entities , three asset management companies , and 29 insurance companies , 14 of which are branches of foreign insurance companies authorised to operate in the principality
the population of andorra is estimated at )
the andorrans are a romance ethnic group of originally catalan descent
the population has grown from 5 , 000 in 1900
two - thirds of residents lack andorran nationality and do not have the right to vote in communal elections
moreover , they are not allowed to be elected as prime minister
the historic and official language is catalan , a romance language
the andorran government encourages the use of catalan
it funds a commission for catalan toponymy in andorra ( catalan ) , and provides free catalan classes to assist immigrants
andorran television and radio stations use catalan
because of immigration , historical links , and close geographic proximity , spanish , portuguese and french are commonly spoken
most andorran residents can speak one or more of these , in addition to catalan
english is less commonly spoken among the general population , though it is understood to varying degrees in the major tourist resorts
andorra is one of only four european countries ( together with france , monaco , and turkey )

39 of andorran children attend andorran schools , 33 attend french schools , and 28 spanish schools
the universitat dandorra ( uda ) is the state public university and is the only university in andorra
it was established in 1997
the university provides first - level degrees in nursing , computer science , business administration , and educational sciences , in addition to higher professional education courses
the only two graduate schools in andorra are the nursing school and the school of computer science , the latter having a phd programme
the geographical complexity of the country as well as the small number of students prevents the university of andorra from developing a full academic programme , and it serves principally as a centre for virtual studies , connected to spanish and french universities
the virtual studies centre ( centre destudis virtuals ) at the university runs approximately 20 different academic degrees at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels in fields including tourism , law , catalan philology , humanities , psychology , political sciences , audiovisual communication , telecommunications engineering , and east asia studies
the centre also runs various postgraduate programmes and continuing - education courses for professionals

in mathematics and statistics , the arithmetic mean or arithmetic average , or simply just the mean or the average ( when the context is clear ) , is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection
the collection is often a set of results of an experiment or an observational study , or frequently a set of results from a survey
the term arithmetic mean is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics , because it helps distinguish it from other means , such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean
in addition to mathematics and statistics , the arithmetic mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as economics , anthropology and history , and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent
for example , per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nations population
while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies , it is not a robust statistic , meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers ( values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values )
for skewed distributions , such as the distribution of income for which a few peoples incomes are substantially greater than most peoples , the arithmetic mean may not coincide with ones notion of middle , and robust statistics , such as the median , may provide better description of central tendency
given a data set x x1 , ldots , xn , the arithmetic mean ( or mean or average ) , denoted barx ( read x bar ) , is the mean of the n values x1 , x2 , ldots , xn
the arithmetic mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in a data set
in statistics , the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency
the arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation , divided by the total number of observations
symbolically , if we have a data set consisting of the values a1 , a2 , ldots , an , then the arithmetic mean a is defined by the formula
for example , consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm 2500 , 2700 , 2400 , 2300 , 2550 , 2650 , 2750 , 2450 , 2600 , 2400
the arithmetic mean is
if the data set is a statistical population ( that is , consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them ) , then the mean of that population is called the population mean , and denoted by the greek letter mu
if the data set is a statistical sample ( a subset of the population ) , then we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean ( which for a data set x is denoted as overlinex )
the arithmetic mean can be similarly defined for vectors in multiple dimension , not only scalar values ; this is often referred to as a centroid
more generally , because the arithmetic mean is a convex combination ( coefficients sum to 1 ) , it can be defined on a convex space , not only a vector space
the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful , especially as a measure of central tendency
these include
the arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median
the median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than , and no more than half are smaller than , the median
if elements in the data increase arithmetically , when placed in some order , then the median and arithmetic average are equal
for example , consider the data sample 1 , 2 , 3 , 4
the average is 2 , as is the median
however , when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically , such as 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly
in this case , the arithmetic average is 6 , while the median is 4
in general , the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample , and can be larger or smaller than most of them
there are applications of this phenomenon in many fields
for example , since the 1980s , the median income in the united states has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income
a weighted average , or weighted mean , is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others , in that they are given more weight in the calculation
for example , the arithmetic mean of 3 and 5 is frac ( 35 ) 2 4 , or equivalently left ( frac12 cdot 3right ) left ( frac12 cdot 5right ) 4
in contrast , a weighted mean in which the first number receives , for example , twice as much weight as the second ( perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled ) would be calculated as left ( frac23 cdot 3right ) left ( frac13 cdot 5right ) frac113
here the weights , which necessarily sum to the value one , are ( 2 / 3 ) and ( 1 / 3 ) , the former being twice the latter
the arithmetic mean ( sometimes called the unweighted average or equally weighted average ) can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other ( equal to frac12 in the above example , and equal to frac1n in a situation with n numbers being averaged )
if a numerical property , and any sample of data from it , could take on any value from a continuous range , instead of , for example , just integers , then the probability of a number falling into some range of possible values can be described by integrating a continuous probability distribution across this range , even when the naive probability for a sample number taking one certain value from infinitely many is zero
the analog of a weighted average in this context , in which there are an infinite number of possibilities for the precise value of the variable in each range , is called the mean of the probability distribution
a most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution ; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency , including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode ( the threems ) , are equal to each other
this equality does not hold for other probability distributions , as illustrated for the log - normal distribution here
particular care must be taken when using cyclic data , such as phases or angles
naively taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180°
in general application , such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range
a solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation ( viz
, define the mean as the central point the point about which one has the lowest dispersion ) , and redefine the difference as a modular distance ( that is , the distance on the circle so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2° , not 358° )
the arithmetic mean is often denoted by a bar , ( a
a vinculum or macron ) , for example as in barx ( read x bar )
some software ( text processors , web browsers ) may not display the x̄ symbol properly
for example , the x̄ symbol in html is actually a combination of two codes - the base letter x plus a code for the line above ( amp ; 772 ; or ¯ )
in some texts , such as pdfs , the x̄ symbol may be replaced by a cent ( ¢ ) symbol ( unicode 162 ) , when copied to text processor such as microsoft word
the american football conference ( afc ) is one of the two conferences of the national football league ( nfl ) , the highest professional level of american football in the united states
this conference currently contains 16 teams organized into 4 divisions , as does its counterpart , the national football conference ( nfc )
both conferences were created as part of the 1970 merger between the national football league , and the american football league ( afl )
all ten of the afl teams , and three nfl teams , became members of the new afc , with the remaining thirteen nfl teams forming the nfc
a series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger , thus making the current total of 16 teams in each conference
the current afc champions are the cincinnati bengals , who defeated the kansas city chiefs in the 2022 afc championship game for their third conference championship , and their first since 1988
like the nfc , the conference has 16 teams organized into four divisions each with four teams east , north , south and west
this chart of the 2021 season standings displays an application of the nfl scheduling formula
the bengals in 2021 ( highlighted in green ) finished in first place in the afc north
thus , in 2021 , the bengals are scheduled to play two games against each of its division rivals ( highlighted in light blue ) , one game against each team in the afc east and nfc south ( highlighted in yellow ) , and one game each against the first - place finishers in the afc south , afc west ( highlighted in orange ) , and nfc east ( highlighted in pink )
currently , the fourteen opponents each team faces over the 17 - game regular season schedule are set using a pre - determined formula
each afc team plays the other teams in their respective division twice ( home and away ) during the regular season , in addition to eleven other games assigned to their schedule by the nfl three games are assigned on the basis of a particular teams final divisional standing from the previous season , and the remaining eight games are split between the roster of two other nfl divisions
this assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle
using the 2021 regular season schedule as an example , each team in the afc west plays against every team in the afc north and nfc east
in this way , non - divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the three games assigned based on the teams prior - season divisional standing
at the end of each season , the four division winners and three wild cards ( non - division winners with best regular season record ) in the afc qualify for the playoffs
the afc playoffs culminate in the afc championship game , with the winner receiving the lamar hunt trophy
the afc champion then plays the nfc champion in the super bowl
both the afc and the nfc were created after the nfl merged with the american football league ( afl ) in 1970
the afl began play in 1960 with eight teams , and added two more expansion clubs ( the miami dolphins in 1966 and the cincinnati bengals in 1968 ) before the merger
in order to equalize the number of teams in each conference , three nfl teams that predated the afls launch ( the cleveland browns , pittsburgh steelers , and the then - baltimore colts ) joined the ten former afl teams to form the afc
the two afl divisions afl east and afl west were more or less intact , while the nfls century division , in which the browns and the steelers had played since 1967 , was moved from the nfl to become the new afc central
upon the completion of the merger of the afl and nfl in 1970 , the newly minted american football conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the 1970 season ; the national football conference , however , could not agree upon their setup , and one was chosen from a fishbowl on january 16 , 1970
since the merger , five expansion teams have joined the afc and two have left , thus making the current total 16
when the seattle seahawks and the tampa bay buccaneers joined the league in 1976 , they were temporarily placed in the nfc and afc respectively
this arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences
the seahawks eventually returned to the nfc as a result of the 2002 realignment
the expansion jacksonville jaguars joined the afc in 1995
there have been five teams that have relocated at least once
in 1984 , the baltimore colts relocated to indianapolis
in 1995 , the cleveland browns had attempted to move to baltimore ; the resulting dispute between cleveland and the team led to modell establishing the baltimore ravens with the players and personnel from the browns , while the browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the nfl
the ravens were treated as an expansion team
in california , the oakland raiders relocated to los angeles in 1982 , back to oakland in 1995 , and then to las vegas in 2020 , while the san diego chargers returned to los angeles in 2017 after 56 years in san diego
the houston oilers moved to tennessee in 1997 , where they were renamed the tennessee oilers
the team would change its name again , two years later , to the tennessee titans
the nfl would again expand in 2002 , adding the houston texans to the afc
with the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time , the divisional setup has remained static ever since
between 1995 and 2021 , the afc has sent only 9 of its 16 teams to the super bowl new england patriots ( 10 times ) , denver broncos ( 4 times ) , pittsburgh steelers ( 4 times ) , baltimore ravens ( 2 times ) , indianapolis colts ( 2 times ) , kansas city chiefs ( 2 times ) , cincinnati bengals ( 1 time ) , las vegas raiders ( 1 time ) , tennessee titans ( 1 time )
by contrast , the nfc has sent 13 of the 16 nfc teams during that same time frame with only the detroit lions , minnesota vikings , and washington commanders missing out on an appearance in the super bowl
17 of the 19 afc champions from 2001 to 2019 have started one of just three quarterbacks - tom brady , peyton manning and ben roethlisberger - in the super bowl
the afc has started 7 quarterbacks in the last 20 super bowls , while the nfc has started 16
the merged league created a new logo for the afc that took elements of the old afl logo , specifically the a and the six stars surrounding it
the afc logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009
the 2010 nfl season introduced an updated afc logo , with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars ( leaving four representing the four divisions of the afc ) , and moving the stars inside the letter , similar to the nfc logo
nbc aired the afcs sunday afternoon and playoff games from 1970 through the 1997 season
from 1998 to 2013 , cbs was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the afc ; in those years , all interconference games in which the afc team was the visiting team were broadcast on either nbc or cbs
since 2014 , the cross - flex policy allows select afc games ( that involve them playing an nfc team at home or intraconference games ) to be moved from cbs to fox
since 1990 , select afc playoff games have been seen on abc or espn
animal farm is a satirical allegorical novella by george orwell , first published in england on 17 august 1945
the book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer , hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal , free , and happy
ultimately , the rebellion is betrayed , and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before , under the dictatorship of a pig named napoleon
according to orwell , the fable reflects events leading up to the russian revolution of 1917 and then on into the stalinist era of the soviet union

the original title was animal farm a fairy story , but us publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946 , and only one of the translations during orwells lifetime , the telugu version , kept it
other titular variations include subtitles like a satire and a contemporary satire
for the french translation , which abbreviates to ursa , the latin word for bear , a symbol of russia
it also played on the french name of the soviet union ,
orwell wrote the book between november 1943 and february 1944 , when the united kingdom was in its wartime alliance with the soviet union against nazi germany , and the british intelligentsia held stalin in high esteem , a phenomenon orwell hated
including one of orwells own , victor gollancz , which delayed its publication
it became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the cold war
time magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best english - language novels ( 1923 to 2005 ) ; and number 46 on the bbcs the big read poll
it won a retrospective hugo award in 1996
the poorly run manor farm near willingdon , england , is ripened for rebellion from its animal populace by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer , mr
one night , the exalted boar , old major , holds a conference , at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called beasts of england
when old major dies , two young pigs , snowball and napoleon , assume command and stage a revolt , driving mr
jones off the farm and renaming the property animal farm
they adopt the seven commandments of animalism , the most important of which is , all animals are equal
the decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn
snowball teaches the animals to read and write , while napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of animalism
to commemorate the start of animal farm , snowball raises a green flag with a white hoof and horn
food is plentiful , and the farm runs smoothly
the pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items , ostensibly for their personal health
following an unsuccessful attempt by mr
jones and his associates to retake the farm ( later dubbed the battle of the cowshed ) , snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a windmill
napoleon disputes this idea , and matters come to head , which culminate in napoleons dogs chasing snowball away and napoleon declaring himself supreme commander
napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm , replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm
through a young porker named squealer , napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea , claiming that snowball was only trying to win animals to his side
the animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill
when the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm , napoleon and squealer persuade the animals that snowball is trying to sabotage their project , and begin to purge the farm of animals accused by napoleon of consorting with his old rival
when some animals recall the battle of the cowshed , napoleon ( who was nowhere to be found during the battle ) gradually smears snowball to the point of saying he is a collaborator of mr
jones , even dismissing the fact that snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle
beasts of england is replaced with animal farm , while an anthem glorifying napoleon , who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man ( comrade napoleon ) , is composed and sung
napoleon then conducts a second purge , during which many animals who are alleged to be helping snowball in plots are executed by napoleons dogs , which troubles the rest of the animals
despite their hardships , the animals are easily placated by napoleons retort that they are better off than they were under mr
jones , as well as by the sheeps continual bleating of “four legs good , two legs bad”
frederick , a neighbouring farmer , attacks the farm , using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill
although the animals win the battle , they do so at great cost , as many , including boxer the workhorse , are wounded
although he recovers from this , boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill ( being almost 12 years old at that point )
he is taken away in a knackers van , and a donkey called benjamin alerts the animals of this , but squealer quickly waves off their alarm by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owners signboard had not been repainted
squealer subsequently reports boxers death and honours him with a festival the following day
( however , napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of boxer to the knacker , allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves
years pass , the windmill is rebuilt and another windmill is constructed , which makes the farm a good amount of income
however , the ideals that snowball discussed , including stalls with electric lighting , heating , and running water , are forgotten , with napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives
snowball has been forgotten , alongside boxer , with the exception of the few who knew him
many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old
jones is also dead , saying he died in an inebriates home in another part of the country
the pigs start to resemble humans , as they walk upright , carry whips , drink alcohol , and wear clothes
the seven commandments are abridged to just one phrase all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others
the maxim four legs good , two legs bad is similarly changed to four legs good , two legs better
other changes include the hoof and horn flag being replaced with a plain green banner and old majors skull , which was previously put on display , being reburied
napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers , with whom he celebrates a new alliance
he abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name the manor farm
the men and pigs start playing cards , flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game
both napoleon and mr
pilkington , one of the farmers , play the ace of spades at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first
when the animals outside look at the pigs and men , they can no longer distinguish between the two
george orwells animal farm is an example of a political satire that was intended to have a wider application , according to orwell himself , in terms of its relevance
furthermore , these two prominent works seem to suggest orwells bleak view of the future for humanity ; he seems to stress the potential / current threat of dystopias similar to those in animal farm and nineteen eighty - four
orwell was committed to communicating in a way that was straightforward , given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse
for this reason , he is careful , in animal farm , to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion
the difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact , as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly , while the wicked animals on the farm , such as napoleon , twist language in such a way that it meets their own insidious desires
this style reflects orwells close proximation to the issues facing europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on stalins soviet russia
george orwell wrote the manuscript between november 1943 and february 1944 the orwell foundationurlhttps / / www

comlanguageen - gb homage to catalonia sold poorly ; after seeing arthur koestlers best - selling , darkness at noon , about the moscow trials , orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism
immediately prior to writing the book , orwell had quit the bbc
he was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the ministry of information had put out
the booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the soviet union , such as directions to claim that the red terror was a figment of nazi imagination
in 1944 , the manuscript was almost lost when a german v - 1 flying bomb destroyed his london home
orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact
orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published , largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between britain , the united states , and the soviet union
four publishers refused to publish animal farm , yet one had initially accepted the work , but declined it after consulting the ministry of information
eventually , secker and warburg published the first edition in 1945
during the second world war , it became clear to orwell that anti - soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch – including his regular publisher gollancz
he also submitted the manuscript to faber and faber , where the poet eliot ( who was a director of the firm ) rejected it ; eliot wrote back to orwell praising the books good writing and fundamental integrity , but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint which i take to be generally trotskyite
eliot said he found the view not convincing , and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm ; he posited that someone might argue what was needed was not more communism but more public - spirited pigs
in his london letter on 17 april 1944 for partisan review , orwell wrote that it was now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti - russian printed
anti - russian books do appear , but mostly from catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle
the publisher jonathan cape , who had initially accepted animal farm , subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him off writing to leonard moore , a partner in the literary agency of christy moore , publisher jonathan cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the ministry of information
such flagrant anti - soviet bias was unacceptable , and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive
it may reasonably be assumed that the important official was a man named peter smollett , who was later unmasked as a soviet agent
if the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right , but the fable does follow , as i see now , so completely the progress of the russian soviets and their two dictators lenin and stalin , that it can apply only to russia , to the exclusion of the other dictatorships
another thing it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs
i think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people , and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy , as undoubtedly the russians are
frederic warburg also faced pressures against publication , even from people in his own office and from his wife pamela , who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards stalin and the red army ,
in october 1945 , orwell wrote to frederic warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist david low might illustrate animal farm
low had written a letter saying that he had had a good time with animal farm – an excellent bit of satire – it would illustrate perfectly
nothing came of this , and a trial issue produced by secker warburg in 1956 illustrated by john driver was abandoned , but the folio society published an edition in 1984 illustrated by quentin blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist ralph steadman was published by secker warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of animal farm
orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about british self - censorship and how the british people were suppressing criticism of the ussr , their world war ii ally
secker and warburg published the first edition of animal farm in 1945 without an introduction
however , the publisher had provided space for a preface in the authors proof composited from the manuscript
for reasons unknown , no preface was supplied , and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute
in 1972 , ian angus found the original typescript titled the freedom of the press , and bernard crick published it , together with his own introduction , in the times literary supplement on 15 september 1972 as how the essay came to be written
the same essay also appeared in the italian 1976 edition of animal farm with another introduction by crick , claiming to be the first edition with the preface
other publishers were still declining to publish it
contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive
writing in the american new republic magazine , george soule expressed his disappointment in the book , writing that it puzzled and saddened me
it seemed on the whole dull
the allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly
soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real - world inspirations , and said , it seems to me that the failure of this book ( commercially it is already assured of tremendous success ) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced , but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well
the guardian on 24 august 1945 called animal farm a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few
the cia , from 1952 to 1957 in operation aedinosaur , sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into poland , hungary and czechoslovakia , whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down

time magazine chose animal farm as one of the 100 best english - language novels ( 1923 to 2005 ) ; it won a retrospective hugo award in 1996 and is included in the great books of the western world selection
popular reading in schools , animal farm was ranked the uks favourite book from school in a 2016 poll
animal farm has also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the us
the following are examples of this controversy that has existed around orwells work
animal farm has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries
the ala also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the international book fair in moscow , russia , in 1977 and banned from schools in the united arab emirates for references to practices or actions that defy arab or islamic beliefs , such as pigs or alcohol
in the same manner , animal farm has also faced relatively recent issues in china
in 2018 , the government made the decision to censor all online posts about or referring to animal farm
however the book itself , as of 2019 , remains sold in stores
amy hawkins and jeffrey wasserstrom of the atlantic stated in 2019 that the book is widely available in mainland china for several reasons censors believe the general public is unlikely to read a highbrow book , because the elites who do read books feel connected to the ruling party anyway , and because the communist party sees being too aggressive in blocking cultural products as a liability
the authors stated it was – and remains – as easy to buy 1984 and animal farm in shenzhen or shanghai as it is in london or los angeles
an enhanced version of the book , launched in india in 2017 , was widely praised for capturing the authors intent , by republishing the proposed preface of the first edition and the preface he wrote for the ukrainian edition
the pigs snowball , napoleon , and squealer adapt old majors ideas into a complete system of thought , which they formally name animalism , an allegoric reference to communism , not to be confused with the philosophy animalism
soon after , napoleon and squealer partake in activities associated with the humans ( drinking alcohol , sleeping in beds , trading ) , which were explicitly prohibited by the seven commandments
squealer is employed to alter the seven commandments to account for this humanisation , an allusion to the soviet governments revising of history in order to exercise control of the peoples beliefs about themselves and their society
these commandments are also distilled into the maxim four legs good , two legs bad which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm , often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of animalism
later , napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law - breaking
the changed commandments are as follows , with the changes bolded
eventually , these are replaced with the maxims , all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others , and four legs good , two legs better as the pigs become more human
this is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments , which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans evil habits
through the revision of the commandments , orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda
orwell biographer jeffrey meyers has written , virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory
in a preface for a 1947 ukrainian edition , he stated , for the past ten years i have been convinced that the destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement
on my return from spain in 1937 i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages
the revolt of the animals against farmer jones is orwells analogy with the october 1917 bolshevik revolution
the battle of the cowshed has been said to represent the allied invasion of soviet russia in 1918 , the pigs rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of a stalinist bureaucracy in the ussr , just as napoleons emergence as the farms sole leader reflects stalins emergence
stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left - wing 1921 kronstadt revolt against the bolsheviks , in chapter seven , when the animals confess their non - existent crimes and are killed , orwell directly alludes to the purges , confessions and show trials of the late 1930s
these contributed to orwells conviction that the bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the soviet system become rotten
peter edgerly firchow and peter davison contend that the battle of the windmill , specifically referencing the battle of stalingrad and the battle of moscow , represents world war ii
during the battle , orwell first wrote , all the animals , including napoleon took cover
orwell had the publisher alter this to all the animals except napoleon in recognition of stalins decision to remain in moscow during the german advance
other connections that writers have suggested illustrate orwells telescoping of russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion , which stands for the abortive revolutions in hungary and in germany ( ch
iv ) ; the conflict between napoleon and snowball ( ch
v ) , parallelling the two rival and quasi - messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another trotskyism , with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the west ; and stalinism with its glorification of russias socialist destiny ;
the books close , with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement , reflected orwells view of the 1943 tehran conference the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pilkington , both suspicious , each played an ace of spades simultaneously
similarly , the music in the novel , starting with beasts of england and the later anthems , parallels the internationale and its adoption and repudiation by the soviet authorities as the anthem of the ussr in the 1920s and 1930s
a solo version , adapted and performed by guy masterson , premièred at the traverse theatre edinburgh in january 1995 and has toured worldwide since
a theatrical version , with music by richard peaslee and lyrics by adrian mitchell , was staged at the national theatre london on 25 april 1984 , directed by peter hall
it toured nine cities in 1985
a new adaptation written and directed by robert icke , designed by bunny christie with puppetry designed and directed by toby olié opened at the birmingham repertory theatre in january 2022 before touring the uk
animal farm has been adapted to film twice
both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties , including sanitising some aspects
a bbc radio version , produced by rayner heppenstall , was broadcast in january 1947
orwell listened to the production at his home in canonbury square , london , with hugh gordon porteous , amongst others
orwell later wrote to heppenstall that porteous , who had not read the book , grasped what was happening after a few minutes
a further radio production , again using orwells own dramatisation of the book , was broadcast in january 2013 on bbc radio 4
tamsin greig narrated , and the cast included nicky henson as napoleon , toby jones as the propagandist squealer , and ralph ineson as boxer
in 1950 , norman pett and his writing partner don freeman were secretly hired by the information research department ( ird ) , a secret wing of the british foreign office , to adapt animal farm into a comic strip
this comic was not published in the uk but ran in brazilian and burmese newspapers
amphibians are ectothermic , tetrapod vertebrates of the class amphibia
all living amphibians belong to the group lissamphibia
they inhabit a wide variety of habitats , with most species living within terrestrial , fossorial , arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water , but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this
the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air - breathing form with lungs
amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin
they are superficially similar to lizards but , along with mammals and birds , reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed
with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins , amphibians are often ecological indicators ; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe
the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony - limbed fins , features that were helpful in adapting to dry land
they diversified and became dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods , but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates
over time , amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity , leaving only the modern subclass lissamphibia
the three modern orders of amphibians are anura ( the frogs ) , urodela ( the salamanders ) , and apoda ( the caecilians )
the number of known amphibian species is approximately 8 , 000 , of which nearly 90 are frogs
the smallest amphibian ( and vertebrate ) in the world is a frog from new guinea ( paedophryne amauensis ) with a length of just south china giant salamander ( andrias sligoi ) , but this is dwarfed by the extinct prionosuchus from the middle permian of brazil
the study of amphibians is called batrachology , while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology
the word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term ) , which means both kinds of life , meaning life
the term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water , including seals and otters
the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed
the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb , university of california , berkeley and the classification by herpetologist darrel frost and the american museum of natural history , available as the online reference database amphibian species of the world
of which nearly 90 are frogs
with the phylogenetic classification , the taxon labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics
classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem - based or a node - based classification
traditionally , amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage , while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians ( frogs , salamanders and caecilians ) and all their descendants is called lissamphibia
the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain , and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups , like the temnospondyli ( traditionally placed in the subclass labyrinthodontia ) or the lepospondyli , and in some analyses even in the amniotes
this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal devonian and carboniferous amphibian - type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy , and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy
all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia , which is usually considered a clade , a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor
the three modern orders are anura ( the frogs ) , caudata ( or urodela , the salamanders ) , and gymnophiona ( or apoda , the caecilians )
the oldest known caecilian is another early jurassic species , eocaecilia micropodia , also from arizona
authorities disagree as to whether salientia is a superorder that includes the order anura , or whether anura is a sub - order of the order salientia
the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders , but an extinct salamander - like family , the albanerpetontidae , is now considered part of lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia
furthermore , salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic proto - frog , triadobatrachus
the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period , around 370 million years ago , from lobe - finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish
many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered
ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians , with nostrils and more efficient lungs
it had four sturdy limbs , a neck , a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe - finned fish , eusthenopteron
amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods
their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger , better able to support the weight of their bodies on land
they developed hands and feet with five or more digits ; the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation
the fishs hyomandibula bone in the hyoid region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear , an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land
an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi - folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra - occipital bones at the back of the head , neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom
at the end of the devonian period ( 360 million years ago ) , the seas , rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates , though some , such as ichthyostega , may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water
it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs , dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal
they were the top land predators , sometimes reaching several metres in length , preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water
they still needed to return to water to lay their shell - less eggs , and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors
it was the development of the amniotic egg , which prevents the developing embryo from drying out , that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed
after the carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles , during the triassic period ( 250 to 200 million years ago ) , the reptiles continued to out - compete the amphibians , leading to a reduction in both the amphibians size and their importance in the biosphere
according to the fossil record , lissamphibia , which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage , may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic
the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating , but the most recent molecular study , based on multilocus sequence typing , suggests a late carboniferous / early permian origin for extant amphibians
the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate
a 2005 molecular phylogeny , based on rdna analysis , suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs
it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic ( around 250 million years ago ) , before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe - finned fish
the briefness of this period , and the swiftness with which radiation took place , would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils
molecular analysis suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates
newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all lissamphibians lived about 315 million years ago , and that stereospondyls are the closest relatives to the caecilians
as they evolved from lunged fish , amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land , including the need to develop new means of locomotion
in the water , the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward , but on land , quite different mechanisms were required
their vertebral columns , limbs , limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding
terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air
they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature
they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment
their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water
the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss
the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs
lacking these membranes , amphibians require water bodies for reproduction , although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage
the andersons salamander meanwhile occurs in brackish or salt water lakes
on land , amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp
modern amphibians have a simplified anatomy compared to their ancestors due to paedomorphosis , caused by two evolutionary trends miniaturization and an unusually large genome , which result in a slower growth and development rate compared to other vertebrates
another reason for their size is associated with their rapid metamorphosis , which seems to have evolved only in the ancestors of lissamphibia ; in all other known lines the development was much more gradual
because a remodeling of the feeding apparatus means they dont eat during the metamorphosis , the metamorphosis has to go faster the smaller the individual is , so it happens at an early stage when the larvae are still small
( the largest species of salamanders dont go through a metamorphosis
the smallest amphibian ( and vertebrate ) in the world is a microhylid frog from new guinea ( paedophryne amauensis ) first discovered in 2012
it has an average length of the largest living amphibian is the but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed—the extinct the largest frog is the african goliath frog ( conraua goliath ) , which can reach
amphibians are ectothermic ( cold - blooded ) vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes
their metabolic rate is low and as a result , their food and energy requirements are limited
in the adult state , they have tear ducts and movable eyelids , and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations
they have muscular tongues , which in many species can be protruded
modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes
their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae
their skulls are mostly broad and short , and are often incompletely ossified
their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales , apart from a few fish - like scales in certain caecilians
the skin contains many mucous glands and in some species , poison glands ( a type of granular gland )
the hearts of amphibians have three chambers , two atria and one ventricle
they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea
most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults
amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils
these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat
the order anura ( from the ancient greek a ( n ) - meaning without and oura meaning tail ) comprises the frogs and toads
they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them , shorter forelimbs , webbed toes with no claws , no tails , large eyes and glandular moist skin
frogs range in size from the to the although most species are associated with water and damp habitats , some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts
they are found worldwide except for polar areas
anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community , but the relationships between some families remain unclear
future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships
the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia are the fossorial megophryidae , pelobatidae , pelodytidae , scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae
these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders
neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs , including most common species
ninety - six percent of the over 5 , 000 extant species of frog are neobatrachians
the order caudata ( from the latin cauda meaning tail ) consists of the salamanders—elongated , low - slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form
this is a symplesiomorphic trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals
urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders
most salamanders are under long
they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat
when on land , they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation , emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms , insects and other invertebrates
the suborder cryptobranchoidea contains the primitive salamanders
a number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found , but there are only three living species , the chinese giant salamander ( andrias davidianus ) , the japanese giant salamander ( andrias japonicus ) and the hellbender ( cryptobranchus alleganiensis ) from north america
these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state ; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded
a unique feature is their ability to feed by suction , depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right
the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders
they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw , and by using internal fertilisation
in salamandrids , the male deposits a bundle of sperm , the spermatophore , and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid
the third suborder , sirenoidea , contains the four species of sirens , which are in a single family , sirenidae
members of this order are eel - like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs
some of their features are primitive while others are derived
fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage
despite this , the eggs are laid singly , a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation
the order gymnophiona ( from the greek gymnos meaning naked and ophis meaning serpent ) or apoda comprises the caecilians
these are long , cylindrical , limbless animals with a snake - or worm - like form
the adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres ( 3 to 30 inches ) with the exception of thomsons caecilian ( caecilia thompsoni ) , which can reach most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch , they make their way to adjacent bodies of water
others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch
a few species give birth to live young , nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct
the integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates , such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers , renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands
local thickenings ( often called warts ) are common , such as those found on toads
the outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece , in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes
amphibians often eat the sloughed skin
caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin
the similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial
lizards and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis , but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages
amphibian skin is permeable to water
gas exchange can take place through the skin ( cutaneous respiration ) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds
to compensate for their thin and delicate skin , amphibians have evolved mucous glands , principally on their heads , backs and tails
the secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist
in addition , most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances
some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect
the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores
these three cell layers consist of the melanophores ( occupying the deepest layer ) , the guanophores ( forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules , producing a blue - green colour ) and the lipophores ( yellow , the most superficial layer )
the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland
unlike bony fish , there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system , and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish
a vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators
amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods , though with a number of variations
they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs
the bones are hollow and lightweight
the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body
the bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes
the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle , and the well - developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs
the ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals
in most amphibians , there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot , but no claws on either
some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel - like in appearance with tiny , stubby legs
the sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs
the caecilians are limbless
they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body
on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side
in frogs , the hind legs are larger than the fore legs , especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming
in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large , and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies
the feet have adaptations for the way of life , with webbing between the toes for swimming , broad adhesive toe pads for climbing , and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging ( frogs usually dig backwards into the soil )
in most salamanders , the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body
locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop , particularly when climbing
in their normal gait , only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors , the lobe - finned fish
salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as autotomy
certain species in the plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily
the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape
both tails and limbs can be regenerated
amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage , and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct
in the juvenile ( or tadpole ) stage , the circulation is similar to that of a fish ; the two - chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated , and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop
in the adult stage , amphibians ( especially frogs ) lose their gills and develop lungs
they have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria
when the ventricle starts contracting , deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs
continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body
mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers
the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates , with a central brain , a spinal cord , and nerves throughout the body
the amphibian brain is relatively simple but broadly the same structurally as in reptiles , birds and mammals
their brains are enlongated , expect in caecilians , and contain the usual motor and sensory areas of tretrapods
tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes , but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians
some caecilians possess electroreceptors that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water
the ears are well developed in frogs
there is no external ear , but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye
this vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone , the stapes , to the inner ear
only high - frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way , but low - frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism
the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound
the eyes of tadpoles lack lids , but at metamorphosis , the cornea becomes more dome - shaped , the lens becomes flatter , and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop
many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws
some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey , repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia
most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs
the short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage
the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey
amphibians possess a pancreas , liver and gall bladder
the liver is usually large with two lobes
its size is determined by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit , and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up
adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen ( in internal structures called fat bodies ) , under the skin and , in some salamanders , in the tail
there are two kidneys located dorsally , near the roof of the body cavity
their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent
larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine , while terrestrial species , with a greater need to conserve water , excrete the less toxic product urea
some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid
the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes , possessing few internal septa and large alveoli , and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood
ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping
because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates , aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration , as in the titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander
in air , where oxygen is more concentrated , some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange , most famously the plethodontid salamanders , which have neither lungs nor gills
many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage , with some ( such as the axolotl ) retaining gills as aquatic adults
for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist
a few ( for example fejervarya raja ) can inhabit brackish water , but there are no true marine amphibians
several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations ( for example , eleutherodactylus , the pacific platymantis , the australo - papuan microhylids , and many other tropical frogs ) , however , do not need any water for breeding in the wild
they reproduce via direct development , an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free - standing water
almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult , passing through the tadpole stage within the egg
reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall , but the seasonal timing
in the tropics , many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year
in temperate regions , breeding is mostly seasonal , usually in the spring , and is triggered by increasing day length , rising temperatures or rainfall
experiments have shown the importance of temperature , but the trigger event , especially in arid regions , is often a storm
in anurans , males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active
the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation
in most of these , the male deposits a spermatophore , a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone , on the substrate either on land or in the water
the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent
the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later
courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species
in some , the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others , the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus
certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae , hynobiidae and cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs , with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass
with a few exceptions , frogs use external fertilisation
the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs , or in the case of epipedobates tricolor , around the neck
they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm
roughened nuptial pads on the males hands aid in retaining grip
often the male collects and retains the egg mass , forming a sort of basket with the hind feet
an exception is the granular poison frog ( oophaga granulifera ) where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously
the tailed frog ( ascaphus truei ) exhibits internal fertilisation
the tail is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female
this frog lives in fast - flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs
most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders
typically , prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site , the males usually arriving first , calling and setting up territories
other satellite males remain quietly nearby , waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory
the females arrive sporadically , mate selection takes place and eggs are laid
the females depart and territories may change hands
more females appear and in due course , the breeding season comes to an end
explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall
these frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site
they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place , perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season
the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues , the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females
there is a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts , with elaborate courtship displays to keep the females attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with
most amphibians go through metamorphosis , a process of significant morphological change after birth
in typical amphibian development , eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle
frogs , toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills
metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood , which stimulates metamorphosis , and prolactin , which counteracts thyroxines effect
specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues
cite book
in the egg , the embryo is suspended in perivitelline fluid and surrounded by semi - permeable gelatinous capsules , with the yolk mass providing nutrients
as the larvae hatch , the capules are dissolved by enzymes secreted from gland at the tip of the snout
the eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae
these penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis
they seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality
the eggs may be deposited singly , in cluster or in long strands
sites for laying eggs include water , mud , burrows , debris and on plants or under logs or stones
the tungara frog ( physalaemus pustulosus ) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs
first a raft is built , then eggs are laid in the centre , and finally a foam cap is overlaid
the foam has anti - microbial properties
it contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female
the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free - living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults
in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders ( plethodontidae ) , direct development takes place , the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults
many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land , and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies
some caecilians , the alpine salamander ( salamandra atra ) and some of the african live - bearing toads ( nectophrynoides spp
their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the females oviduct , often for long periods
other amphibians , but not caecilians , are ovoviviparous
the eggs are retained in or on the parents body , but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult
the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth , either before or after metamorphosis , according to their species
unlike in other amphibians , frog tadpoles do not resemble adults
tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons , gills for respiration ( external gills at first , internal gills later ) , lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming
front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later
iodine and t4 ( over stimulate the spectacular apoptosis programmed cell death of the cells of the larval gills , tail and fins ) also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic , vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial , carnivorous frog with better neurological , visuospatial , olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting
in fact , tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous
pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies , large caudal fins and small mouths ; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation
stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths , shallow bodies and caudal fins ; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria
they also feed on diatoms , filtered from the water through the gills , and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond , ingesting edible fragments
they have a relatively long , spiral - shaped gut to enable them to digest this diet
at metamorphosis , rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely
the spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut
the animal develops a large jaw , and its gills disappear along with its gill sac
eyes and legs grow quickly , and a tongue is formed
there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system
all this can happen in about a day
a few days later , the tail is reabsorbed , due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place
at hatching , a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids , teeth in both upper and lower jaws , three pairs of feathery external gills , and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins
the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond - living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water
pond - type larvae often have a pair of balancers , rod - like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment
some have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form , a condition known as neoteny
neoteny occurs when the animals growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine
lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter
each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg , emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander
the female salamander often broods the eggs
in the genus ensatinas , the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them , effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion
in newts and salamanders , metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs
this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems their lungs are functional early , but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles
their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water
other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins , the closure of gill slits , thickening of the skin , the development of eyelids , and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure
salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land
most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water
the development of the young of ichthyophis glutinosus , a species from sri lanka , has been much studied
the eel - like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water
they have three pairs of external red feathery gills , a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes , a lateral line system and a short tail with fins
they swim by undulating their body from side to side
they are mostly active at night , soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land
metamorphosis is gradual
by the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes , lateral line systems and tails
the skin thickens , embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments
by this time , the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land
in the majority of species of caecilians , the young are produced by viviparity
typhlonectes compressicauda , a species from south america , is typical of these
up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time
they are elongated and have paired sac - like gills , small eyes and specialised scraping teeth
at first , they feed on the yolks of the eggs , but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct
this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall
they may increase their length sixfold and be two - fifths as long as their mother before being born
by this time they have undergone metamorphosis , lost their eyes and gills , developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles , and reabsorbed their teeth
a permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth
the ringed caecilian ( siphonops annulatus ) has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction
the progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy
the brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate
meanwhile , they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca
the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but , in general , the larger the number of eggs in a batch , the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place
nevertheless , it is estimated that in up to 20 of amphibian species , one or both adults play some role in the care of the young
many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land
the black mountain salamander ( desmognathus welteri ) does this , the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs
when fully developed , they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders
the male hellbender , a primitive salamander , excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there
the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch , using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen
the male colostethus subpunctatus , a tiny frog , protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log
when the eggs hatch , the male transports the tadpoles on his back , stuck there by a mucous secretion , to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off
the female gastric - brooding frog ( rheobatrachus spp
) reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings ; however , this stage was never observed before the species became extinct
the tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply
the aquatic surinam toad ( pipa pipa ) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis
amphibians are notable among vertebrates for their diversity of chromosomes and genomes
the karyotypes ( chromosomes ) have been determined for at least 1 , 193 ( 14 ) of the 8 , 200 known ( diploid ) species , including 963 anurans , 209 salamanders , and 21 caecilians
generally , the karyotypes of diploid amphibians are characterized by 20–26 bi - armed chromosomes
amphibians have also very large genomes compared to other taxa of vertebrates and corresponding variation in genome size ( c - value picograms of dna in haploid nuclei )
the genome sizes range from 0 to 11 pg in frogs , from 13 to 120 pg in salamanders , and from 2 to 11 pg in caecilians
the large genome sizes have prevented whole - genome sequencing of amphibians although a number of genomes have been published recently
the 1gb draft genome of xenopus tropicalis was the first to be reported for amphibians in 2010
compared to some salamanders this frog genome is tiny
for instance , the genome of the mexican axolotl turned out to be 32 gb , which is more than 10 times larger than the human genome ( 3gb )
with a few exceptions , adult amphibians are predators , feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow
the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles , caterpillars , earthworms and spiders
the sirens ( siren spp
) often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed the mexican burrowing toad ( rhinophrynus dorsalis ) has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites
it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first , their tongues being hinged at the front
food is mostly selected by sight , even in conditions of dim light
movement of the prey triggers a feeding response
frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs ( rana clamitans ) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past
amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it
they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth , a feature unique to amphibians
the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals
salamanders , caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws , but some frogs ( rana spp
) lack teeth in the lower jaw , and toads ( bufo spp
) have no teeth
in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth
the tiger salamander ( ambystoma tigrinum ) is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates
others amphibians , such as the bufo spp
toads , actively search for prey , while the argentine horned frog ( ceratophrys ornata ) lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes
caecilians do not flick their tongues , but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward - pointing teeth
the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow
the subdued prey is gulped down whole
when they are newly hatched , frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg
when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria , algal crusts , detritus and raspings from submerged plants
water is drawn in through their mouths , which are usually at the bottom of their heads , and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out
others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth
they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment , filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths
some , such as the spadefoot toads , have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic
the calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks , grunts or hisses and have not been much studied
a clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation , as in bats , or a form of communication
most salamanders are considered voiceless , but the california giant salamander ( dicamptodon ensatus ) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound
some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked
frogs are much more vocal , especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates
the presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself
in most species , the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth
this may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator , helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere , or the water at times when the animal is submerged
other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus
when a frog is attacked , a distress or fright call is emitted , often resembling a scream
little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians , but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges
these are usually feeding , breeding or sheltering sites
males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species , females and even juveniles are also involved
although in many frog species , females are larger than males , this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence
some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest , arms or thumbs
in salamanders , defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder
this may involve snapping , chasing and sometimes biting , occasionally causing the loss of a tail
the behaviour of red back salamanders ( plethodon cinereus ) has been much studied
91 of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre ( yard ) of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock
, found their way back to their home base
the salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas
much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals
an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively
if the intruder persisted , a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso - labial grooves
damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival , either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food
in frogs , male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations ; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates
in general , a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual , and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males
much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires
there is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders
holders of territories have a home advantage and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar - sized frogs
if threats are insufficient , chest to chest tussles may take place
fighting methods include pushing and shoving , deflating the opponents vocal sac , seizing him by the head , jumping on his back , biting , chasing , splashing , and ducking him under the water
amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins , and lack claws , defensive armour , or spines
nevertheless , they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive
the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce
this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip
the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic
caecilians have been little studied in this respect , but the cayenne caecilian ( typhlonectes compressicauda ) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in brazil
the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake ( thamnophis sirtalis )
in locations where both snake and salamander co - exist , the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity
poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity
these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black , with the fire salamander ( salamandra salamandra ) being an example
once a predator has sampled one of these , it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal
in some species , such as the fire - bellied toad ( bombina spp
) , the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked , exhibiting their bright colours to the predator
the frog allobates zaparo is not poisonous , but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality , a strategy that may deceive predators
many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day , thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight
other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected
they have various colourings such as mottled browns , greys and olives to blend into the background
some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the north american northern short - tailed shrew ( blarina brevicauda )
their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison - producing granular glands
a few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked , sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape
the tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached
the tail is regenerated later , but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant
some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce , and some spadefoot toads ( pelobates spp ) scream and leap towards the attacker
giant salamanders of the genus andrias , as well as ceratophrine and pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite
the blackbelly salamander ( desmognathus quadramaculatus ) can bite an attacking common garter snake ( thamnophis sirtalis ) two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape
in amphibians , there is evidence of habituation , associative learning through both classical and instrumental learning , and discrimination abilities
in one experiment , when offered live fruit flies ( drosophila virilis ) , salamanders chose the larger of 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3
frogs can distinguish between low numbers ( 1 vs 2 , 2 vs 3 , but not 3 vs 4 ) and large numbers ( 3 vs 6 , 4 vs 8 , but not 4 vs 6 ) of prey
this is irrespective of other characteristics , that is surface area , volume , weight and movement , although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area
dramatic declines in amphibian populations , including population crashes and mass localized extinction , have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world , and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity
mammals , and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1 , 024 times higher
in 2006 , there were believed to be 4 , 035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle
of these , 1 , 356 ( 33 ) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1 , 427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status
any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation
the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species
predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline
the western terrestrial garter snake ( thamnophis elegans ) in california is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers , the yosemite toad ( bufo canorus ) and the mountain yellow - legged frog ( rana muscosa ) , putting the snakes future at risk
if the snake were to become scarce , this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it
the decline in amphibian and reptile populations has led to an awareness of the effects of pesticides on reptiles and amphibians
amphibians and reptiles have complex life cycles , live in different climate and ecological zones , and are more vulnerable to chemical exposure
certain pesticides , such as organophosphates , neonicotinoids , and carbamates , react via cholinesterase inhibition
cholinesterase is an enzyme that causes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine , an excitatory neurotransmitter that is abundant in the nervous system
ache inhibitors are either reversible or irreversible , and carbamates are safer than organophosphorus insecticides , which are more likely to cause cholinergic poisoning
reptile exposure to an ache inhibitory pesticide may result in disruption of neural function in reptiles
the buildup of these inhibitory effects on motor performance , such as food consumption and other activities
the amphibian specialist group of the iucn is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation
another measure would be to stop exploitation of frogs for human consumption
in the middle east , a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was already linked to an increase in mosquitoes and thus has direct consequences for human health

alaska ( ; ; ) is a state located in the western united states on the northwest extremity of north america
a semi - exclave of the , it borders the canadian province of british columbia and the territory of yukon to the east and shares a maritime border with the russian federations chukotka autonomous okrug to the west , just across the bering strait
to the north are the chukchi and beaufort seas of the arctic ocean , while the pacific ocean lies to the south and southwest
alaska is by far the largest state by area , comprising more total area than the next three largest states ( texas , california , and montana ) combined
it represents the seventh largest subnational division in the world
it is the third - least populous and the most sparsely populated state , but by far the continents most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel , with a population of 736 , 081 as of 2020—more than quadruple the combined populations of northern canada and greenland
approximately half of alaskas residents live within the anchorage metropolitan area
the state capital of juneau is the second - largest city in the united states by area , comprising more territory than the states of rhode island and delaware
the former capital of alaska , sitka , is the largest city by area
what is now alaska has been home to various indigenous peoples for thousands of years ; it is widely believed that the region served as the entry point for the initial settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge
the russian empire was the first to actively colonize the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing russian america , which spanned most of the current state
the expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the in 1867 for us7 million ( equivalent to ) , or approximately two cents per acre ( 4 / km2 )
the area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on may 11 , 1912
it was admitted as the 49th state of the on january 3 , 1959
while it has one of the smallest state economies in the country , alaskas per capita income is among the highest , owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing , natural gas , and oil , all of which it has in abundance
united states armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy ; more than half the state is federally owned public land , including a multitude of national forests , national parks , and wildlife refuges
the indigenous population of alaska is proportionally the highest of any state , at over 15 percent
close to two dozen native languages are spoken , and alaskan natives exercise considerable influence in local and state politics
the name alaska ( , at pp
49 ( alaxsxi - x mainland alaska ) , 50 ( alagu - x sea ) , 508 ( - gi suffix , object of its action )
it is also known as alyeska , the great land , an aleut word derived from the same root
numerous indigenous peoples occupied alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of european peoples to the area
linguistic and dna studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge
the tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today southeast alaska , along with parts of british columbia and the yukon
also in southeast were the haida , now well known for their unique arts
the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in 1887 , when president grover cleveland , and later the congress , granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla
all three of these peoples , as well as other indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast , experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid - 19th century , with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s , resulting in high fatalities and social disruption
the aleutian islands are still home to the aleut peoples seafaring society , although they were the first native alaskans to be exploited by the russians
western and southwestern alaska are home to the yupik , while their cousins the alutiiq sugpiaq live in what is now southcentral alaska
the gwichin people of the northern interior region are athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much - contested arctic national wildlife refuge
the north slope and little diomede island are occupied by the widespread inupiat people
some researchers believe the first russian settlement in alaska was established in the 17th century
according to this hypothesis , in 1648 several koches of semyon dezhnyovs expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement
this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin , who had visited alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river , populated by bearded men who pray to the icons
some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river
the first european vessel to reach alaska is generally held to be the st
gabriel under the authority of the surveyor gvozdev and assistant navigator i
fyodorov on august 21 , 1732 , during an expedition of siberian cossack shestakov and russian explorer dmitry pavlutsky ( 1729–1735 )
another european contact with alaska occurred in 1741 , when vitus bering led an expedition for the russian navy aboard the st
after his crew returned to russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world , small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of siberia toward the aleutian islands
the first permanent european settlement was founded in 1784
between 1774 and 1800 , spain sent several expeditions to alaska to assert its claim over the pacific northwest
in 1789 , a spanish settlement and fort were built in nootka sound
these expeditions gave names to places such as valdez , bucareli sound , and cordova
later , the russian - american company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early - to - mid - 19th century
sitka , renamed new archangel from 1804 to 1867 , on baranof island in the alexander archipelago in what is now southeast alaska , became the capital of russian america
it remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the united states
the russians never fully colonized alaska , and the colony was never very profitable
evidence of russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeastern alaska
william seward , the 24th united states secretary of state , negotiated the alaska purchase ( also known as sewards folly ) with the russians in 1867 for 7 million
russias contemporary ruler tsar alexander ii , the emperor of the russian empire , king of poland and grand duke of finland , also planned the sale ; the purchase was made on march 30 , 1867
six months later the commissioners arrived in sitka and the formal transfer was arranged ; the formal flag - raising took place at fort sitka on october 18 , 1867
in the ceremony 250 uniformed soldiers marched to the governors house at castle hill , where the russian troops lowered the russian flag and the flag was raised
this event is celebrated as alaska day , a legal holiday on october 18
alaska was loosely governed by the military initially , and was administered as a district starting in 1884 , with a governor appointed by the united states president
a federal district court was headquartered in sitka
for most of alaskas first decade under the united states flag , sitka was the only community inhabited by american settlers
they organized a provisional city government , which was alaskas first municipal government , but not in a legal sense
legislation allowing alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900 , and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959
starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s , gold rushes in alaska and the nearby yukon territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to alaska
alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912
alaskas capital , which had been in sitka until 1906 , was moved north to juneau
construction of the alaska governors mansion began that same year
european immigrants from norway and sweden also settled in southeast alaska , where they entered the fishing and logging industries
during world war ii , the aleutian islands campaign focused on attu , agattu and kiska , all which were occupied by the empire of japan
unalaska / dutch harbor and adak became significant bases for the united states army , united states army air forces and united states navy
the united states lend - lease program involved flying american warplanes through canada to fairbanks and then nome ; soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft , ferrying them to fight the german invasion of the soviet union
the construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some alaskan cities
statehood for alaska was an important cause of james wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate
decades later , the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946
the alaska statehood committee and alaskas constitutional convention would soon follow
statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes , mostly in the congress but also within alaska
statehood was approved by the congress on july 7 , 1958 ; alaska was officially proclaimed a state on january 3 , 1959
on march 27 , 1964 , the massive good friday earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities , mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides
it was the second - most - powerful earthquake in recorded history , with a moment magnitude of 9 ( more than a thousand times as powerful as the 1989 san francisco earthquake )
the time of day ( 536 pm ) , time of year ( spring ) and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives , particularly in anchorage
the 1968 discovery of oil at prudhoe bay and the 1977 completion of the trans - alaska pipeline system led to an oil boom
royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward
in 1989 , the exxon valdez hit a reef in the prince william sound , spilling more than of coastline
today , the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the proposed pebble mine
located at the northwest corner of north america , alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the united states , but also has the most easterly longitude in the united states because the aleutian islands extend into the eastern hemisphere
of british columbia ( canada ) separates alaska from washington
it is technically part of the continental , but is sometimes not included in colloquial use ; alaska is not part of the contiguous , often called the lower 48
the capital city , juneau , is situated on the mainland of the north american continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the north american highway system
the state is bordered by canadas yukon and british columbia to the east ( making it the only state to border a canadian territory ) ; the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south and southwest ; the bering sea , bering strait , and chukchi sea to the west ; and the arctic ocean to the north
alaskas territorial waters touch russias territorial waters in the bering strait , as the russian big diomede island and alaskan little diomede island are only apart
alaska has a longer coastline than all the other states combined
at in area , alaska is by far the largest state in the united states , and is more than twice the size of the second - largest state , texas
alaska is the seventh largest subnational division in the world , and if it was an independent nation would be the 16th largest country in the world , as it is larger than iran
with its myriad islands , alaska has nearly above the north pacific
the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr , west of anchorage on the mainland
geologists have identified alaska as part of wrangellia , a large region consisting of multiple states and canadian provinces in the pacific northwest , which is actively undergoing continent building
one of the worlds largest tides occurs in turnagain arm , just south of anchorage , where tidal differences can be more than
alaska has more than three million lakes
the bering glacier is the largest glacier in north america , covering
there are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of alaska , but there are six widely accepted regions
the most populous region of alaska , containing anchorage , the matanuska - susitna valley and the kenai peninsula
rural , mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of south central , as do the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova and valdez
also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage , this is the region of alaska closest to the contiguous states
as such , this was where most of the initial non - indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase
the region is dominated by the alexander archipelago as well as the tongass national forest , the largest national forest in the united states
it contains the state capital juneau , the former capital sitka , and ketchikan , at one time alaskas largest city
the interior is the largest region of alaska ; much of it is uninhabited wilderness
fairbanks is the only large city in the region
denali national park and preserve is located here
denali , formerly mount mckinley , is the highest mountain in north america , and is also located here
inland from the bering sea
most of the population lives along the coast
kodiak island is also located in southwest
the massive yukon–kuskokwim delta , one of the largest river deltas in the world , is here
portions of the alaska peninsula are considered part of southwest , with the remaining portions included with the aleutian islands ( see below )
the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages
the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the national petroleum reserve–alaska and the prudhoe bay oil field
more than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain , which stretches more than into the pacific ocean
some of these islands fall in the eastern hemisphere , but the international date line was drawn west of 180° to keep the whole state , and thus the entire north american continent , within the same legal day
two of the islands , attu and kiska , were occupied by japanese forces during world war ii
according to an october 1998 report by the united states bureau of land management , approximately 65 of alaska is owned and managed by the federal government as public lands , including a multitude of national forests , national parks , and national wildlife refuges
, or 23 of the state
the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service
it is the worlds largest wildlife refuge , comprising
of the remaining land area , the state of alaska owns , its entitlement under the alaska statehood act
a portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to the organized boroughs presented above , under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs
smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading - related opportunities
these are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations
the university of alaska , as a land grant university , also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently
another are owned by 12 regional , and scores of local , native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act ( ancsa ) of 1971
regional native corporation doyon , limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications
provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect
effectively , the corporations hold title ( including subsurface title in many cases , a privilege denied to individual alaskans ) but cannot sell the land
individual native allotments can be and are sold on the open market , however
various private interests own the remaining land , totaling about one percent of the state
alaska is , by a large margin , the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when native corporation holdings are excluded
the alaska heritage resources survey ( ahrs ) is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the state of alaska ; it is maintained by the office of history and archaeology
the surveys inventory of cultural resources includes objects , structures , buildings , sites , districts , and travel ways , with a general provision that they are more than fifty years old

alaska is not divided into counties , as most of the other states , but it is divided into boroughs
many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of alaskas 16 boroughs , which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states
however , unlike county - equivalents in the other 49 states , the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state
the area not part of any borough is referred to as the unorganized borough
the unorganized borough has no government of its own , but the census bureau in cooperation with the state divided the unorganized borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation
a recording district is a mechanism for management of the public record in alaska
the state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a state recorder
all recording districts use the same acceptance criteria , fee schedule , etcetera , for accepting documents into the public record
whereas many states use a three - tiered system of decentralization—state / county / township—most of alaska uses only two tiers—state / borough
owing to the low population density , most of the land is located in the unorganized borough
as the name implies , it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government
in 2000 , 57 of alaskas area has this status , with 13 of the population
anchorage merged the city government with the greater anchorage area borough in 1975 to form the municipality of anchorage , containing the city proper and the communities of eagle river , chugiak , peters creek , girdwood , bird , and indian
fairbanks has a separate borough ( the fairbanks north star borough ) and municipality ( the city of fairbanks )
the states most populous city is anchorage , home to 291 , 247 people in 2020
the richest location in alaska by per capita income is denali ( 42 , 245 )
yakutat city , sitka , juneau , and anchorage are the four largest cities in the by area
as reflected in the 2020 united states census , alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and census - designated places ( cdps )
the tally of cities includes four unified municipalities , essentially the equivalent of a consolidated city–county
the majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of alaska known as the bush and are unconnected to the contiguous north american road network
the table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census - designated places in alaska , in population order
of alaskas 2020 census population figure of 733 , 391 , 16 , 655 people , or 2 of the population , did not live in an incorporated city or census - designated place
approximately three - quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of ketchikan , kodiak , palmer and wasilla
cdps have not been established for these areas by the united states census bureau , except that seven cdps were established for the ketchikan - area neighborhoods in the 1980 census ( clover pass , herring cove , ketchikan east , mountain point , north tongass highway , pennock island and saxman east ) , but have not been used since
the remaining population was scattered throughout alaska , both within organized boroughs and in the unorganized borough , in largely remote areas
the climate in south and southeastern alaska is a mid - latitude oceanic climate ( köppen climate classification cfb ) , and a subarctic oceanic climate ( köppen cfc ) in the northern parts
on an annual basis , the southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year
juneau averages over
of precipitation a year , with around of snow , although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow
it is a subarctic climate ( köppen dfc ) due to its brief , cool summers
the climate of western alaska is determined in large part by the bering sea and the gulf of alaska
it is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north
the temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is
this region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation
an area stretching from the northern side of the seward peninsula to the kobuk river valley ( that is , the region around kotzebue sound ) is technically a desert , with portions receiving less than of precipitation
the climate of the interior of alaska is subarctic
some of the highest and lowest temperatures in alaska occur around the area near fairbanks
the summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °f ( the low - to - mid 30s °c ) , while in the winter , the temperature can fall below a year , but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter
the highest and lowest recorded temperatures in alaska are both in the interior
the highest is inside the arctic circle ) on june 27 , 1915 , making alaska tied with hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the united states
the lowest official alaska temperature is
the climate in the extreme north of alaska is arctic ( köppen et ) with long , very cold winters and short , cool summers
even in july , the average low temperature in utqiaġvik is

precipitation is light in this part of alaska , with many places averaging less than per year , mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year
the united states census bureau found in the 2020 united states census that the population of alaska was 736 , 081 on april 1 , 2020 , a 3 increase since the 2010 united states census
according to the 2010 united states census , the state of alaska had a population of 710 , 231 , increasing from 626 , 932 at the 2000 census
in 2010 , alaska ranked as the 47th state by population , ahead of north dakota , vermont , and wyoming ( and washington , )
estimates show north dakota ahead alaska is the least densely populated state , and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world , at
the state was 66 white ( 64 non - hispanic white ) , 14 american indian and alaska native , 5 asian , 3 black or african american , 1 native hawaiian and other pacific islander , 1 from some other race , and 7 from two or more races in 2010
hispanics or latin americans of any race made up 5 of the population in 2010
according to the 2011 american community survey , 83 of people over the age of five spoke only english at home
about 3 spoke spanish at home , 2 spoke another indo - european language , about 4 spoke an asian language ( including tagalog ) , in 2019 , the american community survey determined 83 spoke only english , and 16 spoke another language other than english
the most spoken european language after english was spanish , spoken by approximately 4 of the state population
collectively , asian and pacific islander languages were spoken by 5 of alaskans
known locally as native languages
the alaska native language center at the university of alaska fairbanks claims that at least 20 alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects
nearly all of alaskas native languages were classified as either threatened , shifting , moribund , nearly extinct , or dormant languages
in october 2014 , the governor of alaska signed a bill declaring the states 20 indigenous languages to have official status
this bill gave them symbolic recognition as official languages , though they have not been adopted for official use within the government
the 20 languages that were included in the bill are
according to statistics collected by the association of religion data archives from 2010 , about 34 of alaska residents were members of religious congregations
of the religious population , 100 , 960 people identified as evangelical protestants ; 50 , 866 as roman catholic ; and 32 , 550 as mainline protestants
the largest religious denominations in alaska alaska has been identified , along with washington and oregon in the pacific northwest , as being the least religious states in the united states , in terms of church membership
the pew research center in 2014 determined 62 of the adult population practiced christianity
protestantism was the largest christian tradition , dominated by evangelicalism
mainline protestants were the second largest protestant christian group , followed by predominantly african american churches
the catholic church remained the largest single christian tradition practiced in alaska
of the unaffiliated population , they made up the largest non - christian religious affiliation
atheists made up 5 of the population and the largest non - christian religion was buddhism
in 1795 , the first russian orthodox church was established in kodiak
intermarriage with alaskan natives helped the russian immigrants integrate into society
as a result , an increasing number of russian orthodox churches gradually became established within alaska
in 2009 , there were 6 , 000 jews in alaska ( for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems )
alaskan hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other asian religious communities , including sikhs and jains
in 2010 , alaskan hindus established the sri ganesha temple of alaska , making it the first hindu temple in alaska and the northernmost hindu temple in the world
there are an estimated 2 , 000–3 , 000 hindus in alaska
the vast majority of hindus live in anchorage or fairbanks
estimates for the number of muslims in alaska range from 2 , 000 to 5 , 000
the islamic community center of anchorage began efforts in the late 1990s to construct a mosque in anchorage
they broke ground on a building in south anchorage in 2010 and were nearing completion in late 2014
when completed , the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world
the 2018 gross state product was 55 billion , 48th in the
its per capita personal income for 2018 was 73 , 000 , ranking 7th in the nation
according to a 2013 study by phoenix marketing international , alaska had the fifth - largest number of millionaires per capita in the united states , with a ratio of 6 percent
the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy , with more than 80 of the states revenues derived from petroleum extraction
alaskas main export product ( excluding oil and natural gas ) is seafood , primarily salmon , cod , pollock and crab
agriculture represents a very small fraction of the alaskan economy
agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock , dairy products , vegetables , and livestock
manufacturing is limited , with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere
employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction , shipping , and transportation
military bases are a significant component of the economy in the fairbanks north star , anchorage and kodiak island boroughs , as well as kodiak
federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy , allowing the state to keep taxes low
its industrial outputs are crude petroleum , natural gas , coal , gold , precious metals , zinc and other mining , seafood processing , timber and wood products
there is also a growing service and tourism sector
tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging
alaska has vast energy resources , although its oil reserves have been largely depleted
major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope ( ans ) and cook inlet basins , but according to the energy information administration , by february 2014 alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas , north dakota , and california
prudhoe bay on alaskas north slope is still the second highest - yielding oil field in the united states , typically producing about
the trans - alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to of undiscovered , technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope
alaskas economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating , transportation , electric power and light
although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped , proposals for statewide energy systems ( for example with special low - cost electric interties ) were judged uneconomical ( at the time of the report , 2001 ) due to low ( less than 50¢ / gal ) fuel prices , long distances and low population
the cost of a gallon of gas in urban alaska today is usually thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average ; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs , seasonal usage peaks , nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors
the alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues , established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil , largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed trans - alaska pipeline system
the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale , out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to 900million ) at once
it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone
it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since , diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund
the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose
the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this , mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation
from its initial principal of 734 , 000 , the fund has grown to 50billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska
this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska , though such a stance has never gained momentum
starting in 1982 , dividends from the funds annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans , ranging from an initial 1 , 000 in 1982 ( equal to three years payout , as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme ) to 3 , 269 in 2008 ( which included a one - time 1 , 200 resource rebate )
every year , the state legislature takes out 8 from the earnings , puts 3 back into the principal for inflation proofing , and the remaining 5 is distributed to all qualifying alaskans
to qualify for the permanent fund dividend , one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months , maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences , and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment
the permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a basic income policy in the world
the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states
federal government employees , particularly united states postal service ( usps ) workers and active - duty military members , receive a cost of living allowance usually set at 25 of base pay because , while the cost of living has gone down , it is still one of the highest in the country
rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country , due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure
due to the northern climate and short growing season , relatively little farming occurs in alaska
most farms are in either the matanuska valley , about southwest of anchorage
the short 100 - day growing season limits the crops that can be grown , but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons
the primary crops are potatoes , carrots , lettuce , and cabbage
the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus , especially the delta junction area , about southeast of fairbanks , with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops ; these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely
this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor
delta - area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay
west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants , the hotel and tourist industry , and community - supported agriculture
alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners , small farms and farmers markets in recent years , with the highest percentage increase ( 46 ) in the nation in growth in farmers markets in 2011 , compared to 17 nationwide
alaska , with no counties , lacks county fairs
however , a small assortment of state and local fairs ( with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest ) , are held mostly in the late summer
the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity , and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high - profile commercial activities such as carnival rides , concerts and food
alaska grown is used as an agricultural slogan
alaska has an abundance of seafood , with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific
seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it
many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence , as well as sport
this includes fish taken by hook , net or wheel
hunting for subsistence , primarily caribou , moose , and dall sheep is still common in the state , particularly in remote bush communities
an example of a traditional native food is akutaq , the eskimo ice cream , which can consist of reindeer fat , seal oil , dried fish meat and local berries
alaskas reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula , where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer
most food in alaska is transported into the state from outside ( the other 49 us states ) , and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive
in rural areas , subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive
although most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline , the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high , because of the terrain and difficult road conditions , which change dramatically , due to varying climate and precipitation changes
the cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ( 1 / kg ) or more in some remote areas , during the most difficult times , if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions
the cost of delivering a
some of alaskas popular annual events are the iditarod trail sled dog race from anchorage to nome , world ice art championships in fairbanks , the blueberry festival and alaska hummingbird festival in ketchikan , the sitka whale fest , and the stikine river garnet fest in wrangell
the stikine river attracts the largest springtime concentration of american bald eagles in the world
the alaska native heritage center celebrates the rich heritage of alaskas 11 cultural groups
their purpose is to encourage cross - cultural exchanges among all people and enhance self - esteem among native people
the alaska native arts foundation promotes and markets native art from all regions and cultures in the state , using the internet
influences on music in alaska include the traditional music of alaska natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from russia and europe
prominent musicians from alaska include singer jewel , traditional aleut flautist mary youngblood , folk singer - songwriter libby roderick , christian music singer - songwriter lincoln brewster , metal / post hardcore band 36 crazyfists and the groups pamyua and portugal

there are many established music festivals in alaska , including the alaska folk festival , the fairbanks summer arts festival the anchorage folk festival , the athabascan old - time fiddling festival , the sitka jazz festival , and the sitka summer music festival
the most prominent orchestra in alaska is the anchorage symphony orchestra , though the fairbanks symphony orchestra and juneau symphony are also notable
the anchorage opera is currently the states only professional opera company , though there are several volunteer and semi - professional organizations in the state as well
the official state song of alaska is alaskas flag , which was adopted in 1955 ; it celebrates the flag of alaska
alaskas first independent picture entirely made in alaska was the chechahcos , produced by alaskan businessman austin lathrop and filmed in and around anchorage
released in 1924 by the alaska moving picture corporation , it was the only film the company made
one of the most prominent movies filmed in alaska is mgms eskimo / mala the magnificent , starring alaska native ray mala
in 1932 , an expedition set out from mgms studios in hollywood to alaska to film what was then billed as the biggest picture ever made
upon arriving in alaska , they set up camp hollywood in northwest alaska , where they lived during the duration of the filming
louis mayer spared no expense in spite of the remote location , going so far as to hire the chef from the hotel roosevelt in hollywood to prepare meals
when eskimo premiered at the astor theatre in new york city , the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history
eskimo was critically acclaimed and released worldwide ; as a result , mala became an international movie star
eskimo won the first oscar for best film editing at the academy awards , and showcased and preserved aspects of inupiat culture on film
the 1983 disney movie never cry wolf was at least partially shot in alaska
the 1991 film white fang , based on jack londons 1906 novel and starring ethan hawke , was filmed in and around haines
steven seagals 1994 on deadly ground , starring michael caine , was filmed in part at the worthington glacier near valdez
the 1999 john sayles film limbo , starring david strathairn , mary elizabeth mastrantonio , and kris kristofferson , was filmed in juneau
the psychological thriller insomnia , starring al pacino and robin williams , was shot in canada , but was set in alaska
the 2007 film directed by sean penn , into the wild , was partially filmed and set in alaska
the film , which is based on the novel of the same name , follows the adventures of christopher mccandless , who died in a remote abandoned bus along the stampede trail west of healy in 1992
many films and television shows set in alaska are not filmed there ; for example , northern exposure , set in the fictional town of cicely , alaska , was filmed in roslyn , washington
the 2007 horror feature 30 days of night is set in barrow , alaska , but was filmed in new zealand
many reality television shows are filmed in alaska
in 2011 , the anchorage daily news found ten set in the state
the alaska state troopers are alaskas statewide police force
they have a long and storied history , but were not an official organization until 1941
before the force was officially organized , law enforcement in alaska was handled by various federal agencies
larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on public safety officers who have police training but do not carry firearms in much of the state , the troopers serve as the only police force available
in addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law , wildlife troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations
due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the troopers duties , they employ a wide variety of land , air , and water patrol vehicles
many rural communities in alaska are considered dry , having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages
domestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state ; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse
the alaska department of education and early development administers many school districts in alaska
in addition , the state operates a boarding school , mt
edgecumbe high school in sitka , and provides partial funding for other boarding schools , including nenana student living center in nenana and the galena interior learning academy in galena
there are more than a dozen colleges and universities in alaska
accredited universities in alaska include the university of alaska anchorage , university of alaska fairbanks , university of alaska southeast , and alaska pacific university
alaska is the only state that has no institutions that are part of ncaa division i
the alaska department of labor and workforce development operates avtec , alaskas institute of technology
campuses in seward and anchorage offer one - week to 11 - month training programs in areas as diverse as information technology , welding , nursing , and mechanics
alaska has had a problem with a brain drain
many of its young people , including most of the highest academic achievers , leave the state after high school graduation and do not return
the university of alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four - year scholarships to the top 10 of alaska high school graduates , via the alaska scholars program
beginning in 1998 , schools in rural alaska must have at least 10 students to retain funding from the state , and campuses not meeting the number close
this was due to the loss in oil revenues that previously propped up smaller rural schools
but legislators in the state largely did not agree
alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the the states road system , covering a relatively small area of the state , linking the central population centers and the alaska highway , the principal route out of the state through canada
the state capital , juneau , is not accessible by road , only a car ferry ; this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system , or building a road connection from haines
the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska
the interstate highways in alaska consists of a total of southeast of anchorage at portage
at interstate 93 tunnel as part of the big dig project in boston , massachusetts
the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america
built around 1915 , the alaska railroad ( arr ) played a key role in the development of alaska through the 20th century
it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward to interior alaska by way of south central alaska , passing through anchorage , eklutna , wasilla , talkeetna , denali , and fairbanks , with spurs to whittier , palmer and north pole
the cities , towns , villages , and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as the railbelt
in recent years , the ever - improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroads importance in alaskas economy
the railroad played a vital role in alaskas development , moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward , such as coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage
it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service
the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains
it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country
a stretch of about of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road ; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area
until construction of the parks highway in the 1970s , the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route
in northern southeast alaska , the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway northwards into canada ( british columbia and yukon territory ) , crossing the border at white pass summit
this line is now mainly used by tourists , often arriving by cruise liner at skagway
it was featured in the 1983 bbc television series great little railways
the alaska rail network is not connected to outside
( the nearest link to the north american railway network is the northwest terminus of the canadian national railway at prince rupert , british columbia , several hundred miles to the southeast
) in 2000 , the congress authorized 6million to study the feasibility of a rail link between alaska , canada , and the lower 48
many cities , towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access ; the only modes of access involve travel by air , river , or the sea
alaskas well - developed state - owned ferry system ( known as the alaska marine highway ) serves the cities of southeast , the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula
the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers
the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham , washington and prince rupert , british columbia , in canada through the inside passage to skagway
the inter - island ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway
in recent years , cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market , mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and , to a lesser degree , towns along alaskas gulf coast
the population of ketchikan for example fluctuates dramatically on many days—up to four large cruise ships can dock there at the same time
cities not served by road , sea , or river can be reached only by air , foot , dogsled , or snowmachine , accounting for alaskas extremely well developed bush air services—an alaskan novelty
anchorage and , to a lesser extent fairbanks , is served by many major airlines
because of limited highway access , air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state
anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism ( in 2012–2013 , alaska received almost two million visitors )

regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide , so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the essential air service program
alaska airlines is the only major airline offering in - state travel with jet service ( sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing 737 - 400s ) from anchorage and fairbanks to regional hubs like bethel , nome , kotzebue , dillingham , kodiak , and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities
the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as ravn alaska , penair , and frontier flying service
the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan , the most popular aircraft in use in the state
much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities
the program requires 70 of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities
many communities have small air taxi services
these operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas
perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane
the worlds busiest seaplane base is lake hood , located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport , where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers , cargo , and many items from stores and warehouse clubs
out of the estimated 663 , 661 residents , 8 , 550 were pilots , or about one in 78 , federal aviation administration
http / / www
gov / dataresearch / aviationdatastatistics / civilairmenstatistics / 2005 / 2005 civil airman statistics in alaska there are 8 , 795 active pilot certificates as of 2020
of these , there are 2 , 507 private , 1 , 496 commercial , 2 , 180 airline transport , and 2 , 239 student
there are also 3 , 987 pilots with a instrument rating and 1 , 511 flight instructors
another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled
in modern times ( that is , any time after the mid - late 1920s ) , dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation
various races are held around the state , but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race , a )
the race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo and balto took much - needed medicine to the diphtheria - stricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed
mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash , prizes , and prestige
the serum run is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay , leaving from the community of nenana ( southwest of fairbanks ) to nome
in areas not served by road or rail , primary transportation in summer is by all - terrain vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or snow machine , as it is commonly referred to in alaska
alaskas internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies gci and alaska communications
gci owns and operates what it calls the alaska united fiber optic system in january 2011 , it was reported that a 1billion project to connect asia and rural alaska was being planned , aided in part by 350million in stimulus from the federal government

like all other states , alaska is governed as a republic , with three branches of government an executive branch consisting of the governor of alaska and his or her appointees which head executive departments ; a legislative branch consisting of the alaska house of representatives and alaska senate ; and a judicial branch consisting of the alaska supreme court and lower courts
the alaska legislature consists of a 40 - member house of representatives and a 20 - member senate
senators serve four - year terms and house members two
the governor of alaska serves four - year terms the lieutenant governor runs separately from the governor in the primaries , but during the general election , the nominee for governor and nominee for lieutenant governor run together on the same ticket
alaskas court system has four levels the alaska supreme court , the alaska court of appeals , the superior courts and the district courts
the superior and district courts are trial courts
superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction , while district courts hear only certain types of cases , including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to 100 , 000
the supreme court and the court of appeals are appellate courts
the court of appeals is required to hear appeals from certain lower - court decisions , including those regarding criminal prosecutions , juvenile delinquency , and habeas corpus
the supreme court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals
although in its early years of statehood alaska was a democratic state , since the early 1970s it has been characterized as republican - leaning
local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development , fishing , tourism , and individual rights
alaska natives , while organized in and around their communities , have been active within the native corporations
these have been given ownership over large tracts of land , which require stewardship
alaska was formerly the only state in which possession of one ounce or less of marijuana in ones home was completely legal under state law , though the federal law remains in force
the state has an independence movement favoring a vote on secession from the united states , with the alaskan independence party
six republicans and four democrats have served as governor of alaska
in addition , republican governor wally hickel was elected to the office for a second term in 1990 after leaving the republican party and briefly joining the alaskan independence party ticket just long enough to be reelected
he officially rejoined the republican party in 1994
alaskas voter initiative making marijuana legal took effect on february 24 , 2015 , placing alaska alongside colorado and washington as the first three states where recreational marijuana is legal
the new law means people over 21 can consume small amounts of cannabis
to finance state government operations , alaska depends primarily on petroleum revenues and federal subsidies
this allows it to have the lowest individual tax burden in the united states
the department of revenue tax division
while alaska has no state sales tax , 89 municipalities collect a local sales tax , from 1 to 7 , typically 3–5
other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes , hotel , motel , and bed - and - breakfast bed taxes , severance taxes , liquor and tobacco taxes , gaming ( pull tabs ) taxes , tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes
a part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees ( such as petroleum , aviation motor fuel , telephone cooperative ) is shared with municipalities in alaska
the fall in oil prices after the fracking boom in the early 2010s has decimated alaskas state treasury , which has historically received about 85 percent of its revenue from taxes and fees imposed on oil and gas companies
alaska regularly supports republicans in presidential elections and has done so since statehood
republicans have won the states electoral college votes in all but one election that it has participated in ( 1964 )
no state has voted for a democratic presidential candidate fewer times
alaska was carried by democratic nominee lyndon johnson during his landslide election in 1964 , while the 1960 and 1968 elections were close
since 1972 , however , republicans have carried the state by large margins
in 2008 , republican john mccain defeated democrat barack obama in alaska , 59 to 37
mccains running mate was sarah palin , the states governor and the first alaskan on a major party ticket
obama lost alaska again in 2012 , but he captured 40 of the states vote in that election , making him the first democrat to do so since 1968
in 2020 , joe biden received 42 of the vote for president , marking the high point for a democratic presidential candidate since johnsons 1968 victory
the alaska bush , central juneau , midtown and downtown anchorage , and the areas surrounding the university of alaska fairbanks campus and ester have been strongholds of the democratic party
the matanuska - susitna borough , the majority of fairbanks ( including north pole and the military base ) , and south anchorage typically have the strongest republican showing
alaska has had a long history of primary defeats for incumbent senators , with ernest gruening , mike gravel lisa murkowski all being defeated for the nomination to their re - election
however , murkowski won re - election with a write - in campaign
despite this , alaska has had some long - serving congressmen , with ted stevens serving as senator for 40 years , and don young serving as the at - large representative for 49 years
in the 2020 election cycle , alaskan voters approved ballot measure 2
measure 2 makes alaska the third state with jungle primaries for all statewide races , the second state with ranked choice voting , and the only state with both
the first race to use the new system of elections will be the 2022 special election to fill alaskas only house seat , left vacant by the death of don young
agriculture or farming is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock
agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization , whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities
the history of agriculture began thousands of years ago
after gathering wild grains beginning at least 105 , 000 years ago , nascent farmers began to plant them around 11 , 500 years ago
pigs , sheep , and cattle were domesticated over 10 , 000 years ago
plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world
industrial agriculture based on large - scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output , though about 2billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture
the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods , fibers , fuels and raw materials ( such as rubber )
food classes include cereals ( grains ) , vegetables , fruits , oils , meat , milk , eggs and fungi
over one - third of the worlds workers are employed in agriculture , second only to the service sector , although in recent decades , the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers continues , especially in developing countries where smallholding is being overtaken by industrial agriculture and mechanization that brings an enormous crop yield increase
modern agronomy , plant breeding , agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers , and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields , but causing ecological and environmental damage
selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat , but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage
environmental issues include contributions to global warming , depletion of aquifers , deforestation , antibiotic resistance , and growth hormones in industrial meat production
agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation , such as biodiversity loss , desertification , soil degradation and global warming , all of which can cause decreases in crop yield
genetically modified organisms are widely used , although some are banned in certain countries
the word agriculture is a late middle english adaptation of latin field and while agriculture usually refers to human activities , certain species of ant , agriculture is defined with varying scopes , in its broadest sense using natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life , including food , fiber , forest products , horticultural crops , and their related services
thus defined , it includes arable farming , horticulture , animal husbandry and forestry , but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded
it may also be broadly decomposed into plant agriculture , which concerns the cultivation of useful plants ,
the development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering
and included a diverse range of taxa , in at least 11 separate centers of origin
in the paleolithic levant , 23 , 000 years ago , cereals cultivation of emmer , barley , and oats has been observed near the sea of galilee
rice was domesticated in china between 11 , 500 and 6 , 200 bc with the earliest known cultivation from 5 , 700 bc , cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan some 10 , 500 years ago
where wild boar were first domesticated about 10 , 500 years ago
and was independently domesticated in eurasia
in mesoamerica , wild teosinte was bred into maize by 6 , 000 years ago
scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture
studies of the transition from hunter - gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism ; examples are the natufian culture in the levant , and the early chinese neolithic in china
then , wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted , and gradually came to be domesticated
in eurasia , the sumerians started to live in villages from about 8 , 000 bc , relying on the tigris and euphrates rivers and a canal system for irrigation
ploughs appear in pictographs around 3 , 000 bc ; seed - ploughs around 2 , 300 bc
farmers grew wheat , barley , vegetables such as lentils and onions , and fruits including dates , grapes , and figs
cattle , sheep and goats were domesticated in mehrgarh culture by 8 , 000–6 , 000 bc

cotton was cultivated by the 5th–4th millennium bc
in the americas , crops domesticated in mesoamerica ( apart from teosinte ) include squash , beans , and cacao
cocoa was being domesticated by the mayo chinchipe of the upper amazon around 3 , 000 bc
the turkey was probably domesticated in mexico or the american southwest

the indigenous people of the southwest and the pacific northwest practiced forest gardening and fire - stick farming
the natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a low - intensity fire ecology that sustained a low - density agriculture in loose rotation ; a sort of wild permaculture
indigenous australians , long supposed to have been nomadic hunter - gatherers , practised systematic burning , possibly to enhance natural productivity in fire - stick farming
the gunditjmara and other groups developed eel farming and fish trapping systems from some 5 , 000 years ago
in two regions of australia , the central west coast and eastern central , early farmers cultivated yams , native millet , and bush onions , possibly in permanent settlements
in the middle ages , compared to the roman period , agriculture in western europe became more focused on self - sufficiency
the agricultural population under feudalism was typically organized into manors consisting of several hundred or more acres of land presided over by a lord with a roman catholic church and priest
thanks to the exchange with the al - andalus where the arab agricultural revolution was underway , european agriculture transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants , including the introduction of sugar , rice , cotton and fruit trees ( such as the orange )
after 1492 the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize , potatoes , tomatoes , sweet potatoes and manioc to europe , and old world crops such as wheat , barley , rice and turnips , and livestock ( including horses , cattle , sheep and goats ) to the americas
irrigation , crop rotation , and fertilizers advanced from the 17th century with the british agricultural revolution , allowing global population to rise significantly
since 1900 agriculture in developed nations , and to a lesser extent in the developing world , has seen large rises in productivity as mechanization replaces human labor , and assisted by synthetic fertilizers , pesticides , and selective breeding
the haber - bosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale , greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining a further increase in global population
modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological , political , and economic issues including water pollution , biofuels , genetically modified organisms , tariffs and farm subsidies , leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement
pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals
in nomadic pastoralism , herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture , fodder , and water
this type of farming is practised in arid and semi - arid regions of sahara , central asia and some parts of india
in shifting cultivation , a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees
the cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil becomes too infertile , and the area is abandoned
another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated
this type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly
this practice is used in northeast india , southeast asia , and the amazon basin
subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone , with little left over for transport elsewhere
it is intensively practiced in monsoon asia and south - east asia
intensive farming is cultivation to maximise productivity , with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs ( water , fertilizer , pesticide and automation )
it is practiced mainly in developed countries
from the twentieth century , intensive agriculture increased productivity
it substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour , but caused increased water pollution , and often involved farm subsidies
in recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture , resulting in the organic , regenerative , and sustainable agriculture movements
also known as decoupling
the growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management , selective breeding , demand for non - food biofuel crops , are threatening food security in many parts of the world

unitednations feed the world we are fighting a losing battle , un admits soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally ;
following the three - sector theory , the number of people employed in agriculture and other primary activities ( such as fishing ) can be more than 80 in the least developed countries , and less than 2 in the most highly developed countries
in the same countries today , the figure is less than 10
at the start of the 21st century , some one billion people , or over 1 / 3 of the available work force , were employed in agriculture
it constitutes approximately 70 of the global employment of children , and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry
the service sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007
agriculture , specifically farming , remains a hazardous industry , and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work - related injuries , lung disease , noise - induced hearing loss , skin diseases , as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure
on industrialized farms , injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery , and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers
as an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself , entire families can be at risk for injuries , illness , and death
common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning , machinery and motor accidents , including with all - terrain vehicles
the international labour organization considers agriculture one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors
the organization has developed the safety and health in agriculture convention , 2001 , which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation , the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play
in the united states , agriculture has been identified by the national institute for occupational safety and health as a priority industry sector in the national occupational research agenda to identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues
in the european union , the european agency for safety and health at work has issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in agriculture , livestock farming , horticulture , and forestry
cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints ; geography and climate of the farm ; government policy ; economic , social and political pressures ; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer
agricultural production systems pp
shifting cultivation ( or slash and burn ) is a system in which forests are burnt , releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years
farming systems development , productivity , and sustainability , pp
25–57 in chrispeels then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest , and the farmer moves to a new plot , returning after many more years ( 10–20 )
this fallow period is shortened if population density grows , requiring the input of nutrients ( fertilizer or manure ) and some manual pest control
annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period
this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs
further industrialization led to the use of monocultures , when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage
because of the low biodiversity , nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up , necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers
multiple cropping , in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year , and intercropping , when several crops are grown at the same time , are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures
in subtropical and arid environments , the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall , either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year , or requiring irrigation
in all of these environments perennial crops are grown ( coffee , chocolate ) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry
in temperate environments , where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie , highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system
important categories of food crops include cereals , legumes , forage , fruits and vegetables
natural fibers include cotton , wool , hemp , silk and flax
specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world
production is listed in millions of metric tons , based on fao estimates
animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat , milk , eggs , or wool , and for work and transport
working animals , including horses , mules , oxen , water buffalo , camels , llamas , alpacas , donkeys , and dogs , have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields , harvest crops , wrangle other animals , and transport farm products to buyers
livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source , as grassland - based , mixed , and landless
, 30 of earths ice - and water - free area was used for producing livestock , with the sector employing approximately 1billion people
between the 1960s and the 2000s , there was a significant increase in livestock production , both by numbers and by carcass weight , especially among beef , pigs and chickens , the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10
non - meat animals , such as milk cows and egg - producing chickens , also showed significant production increases
global cattle , sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050
during the second half of the 20th century , producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production , while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity
this trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds , leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds
grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland , rangeland , and pastures for feeding ruminant animals
outside nutrient inputs may be used , however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source
this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil , representing 30–40million pastoralists
mixed production systems use grassland , fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric ( one stomach ; mainly chickens and pigs ) livestock
manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops
landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm , representing the de - linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in organisation for economic co - operation and development member countries
synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure use becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution
industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork
scientists estimate that 75 of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in confined animal feeding operations , sometimes called factory farming
much of this growth is happening in developing countries in asia , with much smaller amounts of growth in africa
some of the practices used in commercial livestock production , including the usage of growth hormones , are controversial
tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or harrow to prepare for planting , for nutrient incorporation , or for pest control
tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no - till
it may improve productivity by warming the soil , incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds , but also renders soil more prone to erosion , triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing co2 , and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organismsland preparation and farm energy , pp
pest control includes the management of weeds , insects , mites , and diseases
chemical ( pesticides ) , biological ( biocontrol ) , mechanical ( tillage ) , and cultural practices are used
cultural practices include crop rotation , culling , cover crops , intercropping , composting , avoidance , and resistance
integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss , and recommends pesticides as a last resort
pesticide use in crop production , pp
nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production , and the method of use of manure produced by livestock
nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers , manure , green manure , compost and minerals
soil and land , pp
165–210 in acquaah crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period
manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing , such as in managed intensive rotational grazing , or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures

water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable , which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world
some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall
in other areas such as the great plains in the and canada , farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year

according to a report by the international food policy research institute , agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other ; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity , food security and trade by 2050 , the international food policy research institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40 and food prices could be reduced by almost half
payment for ecosystem services is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment
measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city , to improve the supply of fresh water
crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years , since the beginning of civilization
altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make - up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans , for example , larger fruits or seeds , drought - tolerance , or resistance to pests
significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel
his work on dominant and recessive alleles , although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years , gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques
crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits , self - pollination and cross - pollination , and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism
domestication of plants has , over the centuries increased yield , improved disease resistance and drought tolerance , eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants
careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants
plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture ( grasses and clover ) in new zealand
extensive x - ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts ( that is primitive genetic engineering ) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat , corn ( maize ) and barley
the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating high - yielding varieties
for example , average yields of corn ( maize ) in the us have increased from around 2 tons per hectare ( t / ha ) ( 40 bushels per acre ) in 1900 to about 9 t / ha ( 150 bushels per acre ) in 2001
similarly , worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t / ha in 1900 to more than 2 t / ha in 1990
south american average wheat yields are around 2 t / ha , african under 1 t / ha , and egypt and arabia up to 3 to 4 t / ha with irrigation
in contrast , the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over 8 t / ha
variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate , genetics , and the level of intensive farming techniques ( use of fertilizers , chemical pest control , growth control to avoid lodging )
genetically modified organisms ( gmo ) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology
genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops
increased durability , nutritional content , insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering
currently a global treaty , the biosafety protocol , regulates the trade of gmos
there is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from gmos , and while the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled , the us does not
herbicide - resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides , including glyphosate
these seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop
herbicide - tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide
other gmo crops used by growers include insect - resistant crops , which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis ( bt ) , which produces a toxin specific to insects
these crops resist damage by insects
agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation , such as biodiversity loss , desertification , soil degradation and global warming , which cause decrease in crop yield
agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature ( especially herbicides and insecticides ) , nutrient runoff , excessive water usage , and loss of natural environment
a 2000 assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for 1996 of £2 , 343million , or £208 per hectare
both studies , which focused solely on the fiscal impacts , concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs
neither included subsidies in their analysis , but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society
agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs
yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens , predators , and competitors ( such as weeds )
costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units , such as making fields larger ; this means removing hedges , ditches and other areas of habitat
pesticides kill insects , plants and fungi
these and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land
a senior un official , henning steinfeld , said that livestock are one of the most significant contributors to todays most serious environmental problems through deforestation and land degradation , livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity
furthermore , the unep states that methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns
land transformation , the use of land to yield goods and services , is the most substantial way humans alter the earths ecosystems , and is the driving force causing biodiversity loss
estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50
land management is the driving factor behind degradation ; 1billion people rely upon the degrading land
degradation can be through deforestation , desertification , soil erosion , mineral depletion , acidification , or salinization
eutrophication , excessive nutrient enrichment in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia , leads to fish kills , loss of biodiversity , and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses
excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland , as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient ( mainly nitrogen and phosphorus ) runoff and leaching from agricultural land
these nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater , with harmful effects on human populations
agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources
agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers , and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate
it is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern china , the upper ganges and the western us are being depleted , and new research extends these problems to aquifers in iran , mexico and saudi arabia
agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems , including the destruction of natural wetlands , the spread of water - borne diseases , and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging , when irrigation is performed incorrectly
pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2 the world health organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually , causing 220 , 000 deaths

pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population , leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide

an alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming , a view exemplified by a quote heading the center for global food issues website growing more per acre leaves more land for nature
however , critics argue that a trade - off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable , lappe , ; collins , ; rosset , ( 1998 )

our environment and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation
the push–pull agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping , using plant aromas to repel pests from crops ( push ) and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed ( pull )
agriculture , and in particular animal husbandry , is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions of co2 and a percentage of the worlds methane , and future land infertility , and the displacement of wildlife
agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases , and by the conversion of non - agricultural land such as forest for agricultural use
a range of policies can reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture , and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector
current farming methods have resulted in over - stretched water resources , high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility
there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices ; therefore how critical water , land , and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered
a solution would be to give value to ecosystems , recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs , and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests
technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable
other potential practices include conservation agriculture , agroforestry , improved grazing , avoided grassland conversion , and biochar
current mono - crop farming practices in the united states preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices , such as 2 - 3 crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops , unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy
the international food policy research institute states that agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other ; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity , food security and trade by 2050 , it found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40 and food prices could be reduced by almost half
the food demand of earths projected population , with current climate change predictions , could be satisfied by improvement of agricultural methods , expansion of agricultural areas , and a sustainability - oriented consumer mindset
since the 1940s , agricultural productivity has increased dramatically , due largely to the increased use of energy - intensive mechanization , fertilizers and pesticides
the vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources
as world population doubled
heavy reliance on petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output
industrialized agriculture depends on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways direct consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm
direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery
indirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers , pesticides , and farm machinery
in particular , the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of agricultural energy usage
plastic products are used extensively in agriculture , for example to increase crop yield and improve the efficiency of water and agrichemical use
“agriplastic” products include films to cover greenhouses and tunnels , mulch to cover soil ( for example to suppress weeds , conserve water , increase soil temperature and aid fertilizer application ) , shade cloth , pesticide containers , seedling trays , protective mesh and irrigation tubing
the polymers most commonly used in these products are low - density polyethylene ( lpde ) , linear low - density polyethylene ( lldpe ) , polypropylene ( pp ) and polyvinyl chloride ( pvc )
the total amount of plastics used in agriculture is difficult to quantify
a 2012 study reported that almost 6 million tonnes per year were consumed globally while a later study estimated that global demand in 2015 was between 7 million and 9 million tonnes
widespread use of plastic mulch and lack of systematic collection and management have led to the generation of large amounts of mulch residue
weathering and degradation eventually cause the mulch to fragment
these fragments and larger pieces of plastic accumulate in soil
mulch residue has been measured at levels of 50 to 260kg per hectare in topsoil in areas where the mulch has been used for more than 10 years , which confirms that mulching is a major source of both microplastic and macroplastic contamination of soil
agricultural plastics , especially plastic films , are not easy to recycle because of high contamination levels ( up to 40 - 50 by weight contamination by pesticides , fertilizers , soil and debris , moist vegetation , silage juice water , and uv stabilizers ) and collection difficulties
therefore , they are often buried or abandoned in fields and watercourses or burned
these disposal practices lead to soil degradation and can result in contamination of soils and leakage of microplastics into the marine environment as a result of precipitation run - off and tidal washing
in addition , additives in residual plastic film ( such as uv and thermal stabilizers ) may have deleterious effects on crop growth , soil structure , nutrient transport and salt levels
there is a risk that plastic mulch will deteriorate soil quality , deplete soil organic matter stocks , increase soil water repellence and emit greenhouse gases
microplastics released through fragmentation of agricultural plastics can absorb and concentrate contaminants capable of being passed up the trophic chain
agricultural economics is economics as it relates to the production , distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services
although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent , major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history , ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the post - american civil war southern united states in the united states , and elsewhere , food costs attributed to food processing , distribution , and agricultural marketing , sometimes referred to as the value chain , have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined
this is related to the greater efficiency of farming , combined with the increased level of value addition ( for example more highly processed products ) provided by the supply chain
market concentration has increased in the sector as well , and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency , the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers ( farmers ) and consumers , and may have negative implications for rural communities
national government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products , in the form of taxation , subsidies , tariffs and other measures
however , unprocessed commodities such as corn , soybeans , and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality , affecting the price the producer receives
commodities are generally reported by production quantities , such as volume , number or weight
agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact , natural , economic and social sciences used in the practice and understanding of agriculture
it covers topics such as agronomy , plant breeding and genetics , plant pathology , crop modelling , soil science , entomology , production techniques and improvement , study of pests and their management , and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation , waste management , and bioremediation
the scientific study of agriculture began in the 18th century , when johann friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum ( hydrated calcium sulphate ) as a fertilizer
john armstrong , jesse buel
a treatise on agriculture , the present condition of the art abroad and at home , and the theory and practice of husbandry
to which is added , a dissertation on the kitchen and garden
research became more systematic when in 1843 , john lawes and henry gilbert began a set of long - term agronomy field experiments at rothamsted research station in england ; some of them , such as the park grass experiment , are still running
in america , the hatch act of 1887 provided funding for what it was the first to call agricultural science , driven by farmers interest in fertilizers
agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products
governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets
some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment ( including policies related to climate change , food safety and natural disasters ) , economic stability ( including policies related to taxes ) , natural resources and environmental sustainability ( especially water policy ) , research and development , and market access for domestic commodities ( including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries )
there are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy , including consumers , agribusiness , trade lobbies and other groups
agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making , in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions
political action groups , including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions , also provide influence , as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities
aldous leonard huxley ( 26 july 1894 – 22 november 1963 ) was an english writer and philosopher
he wrote nearly 50 books—both novels and non - fiction works—as well as wide - ranging essays , narratives , and poems
born into the prominent huxley family , he graduated from balliol college , oxford , with an undergraduate degree in english literature
early in his career , he published short stories and poetry and edited the literary magazine oxford poetry , before going on to publish travel writing , satire , and screenplays
he spent the latter part of his life in the united states , living in los angeles from 1937 until his death
by the end of his life , huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the foremost intellectuals of his time
he was nominated for the nobel prize in literature nine times and was elected companion of literature by the royal society of literature in 1962

huxley was a pacifist
and universalism , addressing these subjects with works such as the perennial philosophy ( 1945 ) —which illustrates commonalities between western and eastern mysticism—and the doors of perception ( 1954 ) —which interprets his own psychedelic experience with mescaline
in his most famous novel brave new world ( 1932 ) and his final novel island ( 1962 ) , he presented his vision of dystopia and utopia , respectively
huxley was born in godalming , surrey , england , in 1894
he was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster leonard huxley , who edited the cornhill magazine , and his first wife , julia arnold , who founded priors field school
julia was the niece of poet and critic matthew arnold and the sister of mrs
humphry ward
julia named him aldous after a character in one of her sisters novels
aldous was the grandson of thomas henry huxley , the zoologist , agnostic , and controversialist ( darwins bulldog )
his brother julian huxley and half - brother andrew huxley also became outstanding biologists
aldous had another brother , noel trevenen huxley ( 1889–1914 ) , who took his own life after a period of clinical depression
as a child , huxleys nickname was ogie , short for ogre
he was described by his brother , julian , as someone who frequently contemplated the strangeness of things
according to his cousin and contemporary , gervas huxley , he had an early interest in drawing
huxleys education began in his fathers well - equipped botanical laboratory , after which he enrolled at hillside school near godalming
he was taught there by his own mother for several years until she became terminally ill
after hillside he went on to eton college
his mother died in 1908 , when he was 14 ( his father later remarried )
this ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor
in october 1913 , huxley entered balliol college , oxford , where he studied english literature
he volunteered for the british army in january 1916 , for the great war ; however , he was rejected on health grounds , being half - blind in one eye

marshall cavendish his eyesight later partly recovered
he edited oxford poetry in 1916 , and in june of that year graduated ba with first class honours
his brother julian wrote
following his years at balliol , huxley , being financially indebted to his father , decided to find employment
he taught french for a year at eton college , where eric blair ( who was to take the pen name george orwell ) and steven runciman were among his pupils
he was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class
nevertheless , blair and others spoke highly of his excellent command of language
huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at brunner and mond , an advanced chemical plant in billingham in county durham , northeast england
according to the introduction to the latest edition of his science fiction novel brave new world ( 1932 ) , the experience he had there of an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence was an important source for the novel
huxley completed his first ( unpublished ) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early twenties , establishing himself as a successful writer and social satirist
his first published novels were social satires , crome yellow ( 1921 ) , antic hay ( 1923 ) , those barren leaves ( 1925 ) , and point counter point ( 1928 )
brave new world ( 1932 ) was his fifth novel and first dystopian work
in the 1920s , he was also a contributor to vanity fair and british vogue magazines
during the first world war , huxley spent much of his time at garsington manor near oxford , home of lady ottoline morrell , working as a farm labourer
while at the manor , he met several bloomsbury group figures , including bertrand russell , alfred north whitehead , they lived with their young son in italy part of the time during the 1920s , where huxley would visit his friend lawrence
following lawrences death in 1930 , huxley edited lawrences letters ( 1932 )
very early in 1929 , in london , huxley met gerald heard , a brilliant writer and broadcaster , philosopher and interpreter of contemporary science
works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress , most famously brave new world , and on pacifist themes ( for example , eyeless in gaza )
in brave new world , set in a dystopian london , huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and pavlovian conditioning
huxley was strongly influenced by matthias alexander , and included him as a character in eyeless in gaza ( 1936 )
beginning in this period , huxley began to write and edit non - fiction works on pacifist issues , including ends and means ( 1937 ) , an encyclopedia of pacifism , and pacifism and philosophy , and was an active member of the peace pledge union
in 1937 , huxley moved to hollywood with his wife maria , son matthew huxley , and friend gerald heard
he lived in the , mainly in southern california , until his death , and also for a time in taos , new mexico , where he wrote ends and means ( published in 1937 )
the book contains tracts on war , religion , nationalism , and ethics
heard introduced huxley to vedanta ( upanishad - centered philosophy ) , meditation , and vegetarianism through the principle of ahimsa
in 1938 , huxley befriended jiddu krishnamurti , whose teachings he greatly admired
huxley and krishnamurti entered into an enduring exchange ( sometimes edging on debate ) over many years , with krishnamurti representing the more rarefied , detached , ivory - tower perspective and huxley , with his pragmatic concerns , the more socially and historically informed position
huxley provided an introduction to krishnamurtis quintessential statement , the first and last freedom ( 1954 )
huxley also became a vedantist in the circle of hindu swami prabhavananda , and introduced christopher isherwood to this circle
not long afterwards , huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas , the perennial philosophy , which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world
huxleys book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted five senses and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities
huxley became a close friend of remsen bird , president of occidental college
he spent much time at the college , which is in the eagle rock neighbourhood of los angeles
the college appears as tarzana college in his satirical novel after many a summer ( 1939 )
the novel won huxley a british literary award , the 1939 james tait black memorial prize for fiction
huxley also incorporated bird into the novel
during this period , huxley earned a substantial income as a hollywood screenwriter ; christopher isherwood , in his autobiography my guru and his disciple , states that huxley earned more than 3 , 000 per week ( approximately 50 , 000 in 2020 dollars ) as a screenwriter , and that he used much of it to transport jewish and left - wing writer and artist refugees from hitlers germany to the us
huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of unwins 1940 book hopousia or the sexual and economic foundations of a new society
on 21 october 1949 , huxley wrote to george orwell , author of nineteen eighty - four , congratulating him on how fine and how profoundly important the book is
in his letter to orwell , he predicted
in 1953 , huxley and maria applied for united states citizenship and presented themselves for examination
when huxley refused to bear arms for the and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals , the only excuse allowed under the mccarran act , the judge had to adjourn the proceedings
he withdrew his application
nevertheless , he remained in the in 1959 , huxley turned down an offer to be made a knight bachelor by the macmillan government without putting forward a reason ; his brother julian had been knighted in 1958 , while another brother andrew would be knighted in 1974
in the fall semester of 1960 huxley was invited by professor huston smith to be the carnegie visiting professor of humanities at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit )

biographer harold watts wrote that huxleys writings in the final and extended period of his life are the work of a man who is meditating on the central problems of many modern men
huxleys engagement with eastern wisdom traditions was entirely compatible with a strong appreciation of modern science
biographer milton birnbaum wrote that huxley ended by embracing both science and eastern religion
in a philosophers visionary prediction , published one month before he died , huxley endorsed training in general semantics and the nonverbal world of culturally uncontaminated consciousness , writing that we must learn how to be mentally silent , we must cultivate the art of pure receptivity
the individual must learn to decondition himself , must be able to cut holes in the fence of verbalized symbols that hems him in
beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963 , huxley had an extensive association with the vedanta society of southern california , founded and headed by swami prabhavananda
together with gerald heard , christopher isherwood and other followers , he was initiated by the swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices
in 1944 , huxley wrote the introduction to the bhagavad gita the song of god , translated by swami prabhavananda and christopher isherwood , which was published by the vedanta society of southern california
from 1941 until 1960 , huxley contributed 48 articles to vedanta and the west , published by the society
he also served on the editorial board with isherwood , heard , and playwright john van druten from 1951 through 1962
huxley also occasionally lectured at the hollywood and santa barbara vedanta temples
two of those lectures have been released on cd knowledge and understanding and who are we from 1955
nonetheless , huxleys agnosticism , together with his speculative propensity , made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalised religion
in the spring of 1953 , huxley had his first experience with the psychedelic drug mescaline
huxley had initiated a correspondence with doctor humphry osmond , a british psychiatrist then employed in a canadian institution , and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline ; osmond obliged and supervised huxleys session in southern california
after the publication of the doors of perception , in which he recounted this experience , huxley and swami prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience , which may have caused the relationship to cool , but huxley continued to write articles for the societys journal , lecture at the temple , and attend social functions
huxley later had an experience on mescaline that he considered more profound than those detailed in the doors of perception
huxley wrote that the mystical experience is doubly valuable ; it is valuable because it gives the experiencer a better understanding of himself and the world and because it may help him to lead a less self - centered and more creative life
differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of huxleys eyesight at specific points in his life
circa 1939 , huxley encountered the bates method , in which he was instructed by margaret darst corbett
in 1940 , huxley relocated from hollywood to a
it was , and is , widely believed that huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens , despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at oxford
for example , some ten years after publication of the art of seeing , in 1952 , bennett cerf was present when huxley spoke at a hollywood banquet , wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious
he wasnt reading his address at all
he had learned it by heart
to refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes
when it was only an inch or so away he still couldnt read it , and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him
it was an agonising moment
cerf , bennett ( 12 april 1952 ) , the saturday review ( column ) , quoted in
brazilian author joão ubaldo ribeiro , who as a young journalist spent several evenings in the huxleys company in the late 1950s , wrote that huxley had said to him , with a wry smile i can hardly see at all
and i dont give a damn , really
on the other hand , huxleys second wife , laura archera , later emphasised in her biographical account , this timeless moment one of the great achievements of his life that of having regained his sight
after revealing a letter she wrote to the los angeles times disclaiming the label of huxley as a poor fellow who can hardly see by walter alvarez , she tempered her statement although i feel it was an injustice to treat aldous as though he were blind , it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision
for instance , although aldous did not wear glasses , he would quite often use a magnifying lens
laura huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to huxleys vision
her account , in this respect , agrees with the following sample of huxleys own words from the art of seeing the most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism , or any part of the organism , is that it is not constant , but highly variable
nevertheless , the topic of huxleys eyesight has continued to endure similar , significant controversy
american popular science author steven johnson , in his book mind wide open , quotes huxley about his difficulties with visual encoding i am and , for as long as i can remember , i have always been a poor visualizer
words , even the pregnant words of poets , do not evoke pictures in my mind
no hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep
when i recall something , the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object
by an effort of the will , i can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon
huxley married on 10 july 1919 maria nys ( 10 september 1899 – 12 february 1955 ) , a belgian epidemiologist from bellem , a village near aalter , he met at garsington , oxfordshire , in 1919
they had one child , matthew huxley ( 19 april 1920 – 10 february 2005 ) , who had a career as an author , anthropologist , and prominent epidemiologist
in 1955 , maria huxley died of cancer
in 1956 , huxley married laura archera ( 1911–2007 ) , also an author , as well as a violinist and psychotherapist
she wrote this timeless moment , a biography of huxley
she told the story of their marriage through mary ann braubachs 2010 documentary , huxley on huxley
huxley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in 1960 ; in the years that followed , with his health deteriorating , he wrote the utopian novel island , and gave lectures on human potentialities both at the ucsf medical center and at the esalen institute
these lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the human potential movement
huxley was a close friend of jiddu krishnamurti and rosalind rajagopal , and was involved in the creation of the happy valley school , now besant hill school , of happy valley , in ojai , california
the most substantial collection of huxleys few remaining papers , following the destruction of most in the 1961 bel air fire , is at the library of the university of california , los angeles
on 9 april 1962 huxley was informed he was elected companion of literature by the royal society of literature , the senior literary organisation in britain , and he accepted the title via letter on 28 april 1962

lit verlag münster the correspondence between huxley and the society is kept at the cambridge university library
the society invited huxley to appear at a banquet and give a lecture at somerset house , london , in june 1963
huxley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society ; however , his deteriorating health meant he was not able to attend
on his deathbed , unable to speak owing to advanced laryngeal cancer , huxley made a written request to his wife laura for lsd , 100 µg , intramuscular
according to her account of his death in this timeless moment , she obliged with an injection at 1120a
and a second dose an hour later ; huxley died aged 69 , at 520p
( los angeles time ) , on 22 november 1963
media coverage of huxleys death , along with that of fellow british author lewis , was overshadowed by the assassination of american president john kennedy on the same day , less than seven hours before huxleys death
in a 2009 article for new york magazine titled the eclipsed celebrity death club , christopher bonanos wrote
this coincidence served as the basis for peter kreefts book between heaven and hell a dialog somewhere beyond death with john kennedy , lewis , aldous huxley , which imagines a conversation among the three men taking place in purgatory following their deaths
huxleys memorial service took place in london in december 1963 ; it was led by his elder brother julian
on 27 october 1971 , his ashes were interred in the family grave at the watts cemetery , home of the watts mortuary chapel in compton , guildford , surrey , england
huxley had been a long - time friend of russian composer igor stravinsky , who dedicated his last orchestral composition to huxley

algae is an informal term for a large and diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms it is a polyphyletic grouping that includes species from multiple distinct clades
included organisms range from unicellular microalgae , such as chlorella , prototheca and the diatoms , to multicellular forms , such as the giant kelp , a large brown alga which may grow up to in length
most are aquatic and autotrophic ( they generate food internally ) and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types , such as stomata , xylem and phloem that are found in land plants
the largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds , while the most complex freshwater forms are the charophyta , a division of green algae which includes , for example , spirogyra and stoneworts
no definition of algae is generally accepted
one definition is that algae have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells
algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor , and although their plastids seem to have a single origin , from cyanobacteria , algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies , from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction
algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants , such as the phyllids ( leaf - like structures ) of bryophytes , rhizoids of nonvascular plants , and the roots , leaves , and other organs found in tracheophytes ( vascular plants )
most are phototrophic , although some are mixotrophic , deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy , myzotrophy , or phagotrophy
some unicellular species of green algae , many golden algae , euglenids , dinoflagellates , and other algae have become heterotrophs ( also called colorless or apochlorotic algae ) , sometimes parasitic , relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus
some other heterotrophic organisms , such as the apicomplexans , are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids , but are not traditionally considered as algae
algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a by - product of photosynthesis , unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria
fossilized filamentous algae from the vindhya basin have been dated back to 1 to 1billion years ago
because of the wide range of types of algae , they have increasing different industrial and traditional applications in human society
traditional seaweed farming practices have existed for thousands of years and have strong traditions in east asia food cultures
more modern algaculture applications extend the food traditions for other applications include cattle feed , using algae for bioremediation or pollution control , transforming sunlight into algae fuels or other chemicals used in industrial processes , and in medical and scientific applications
a 2020 review found that these applications of algae could play an important role in carbon sequestration in order to mitigate climate change while providing valuable value - add products for global economies
the singular the etymology is obscure
although some speculate that it is related to latin no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature
a more likely source is
the ancient greek word for seaweed was ) , which could mean either the seaweed ( probably red algae ) or a red dye derived from it
the latinization , (
accordingly , the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology , depending on whether the greek or latin root is used
the name fucus appears in a number of taxa
the committee on the international code of botanical nomenclature has recommended certain suffixes for use in the classification of algae
these are - phyta for division , - phyceae for class , - phycideae for subclass , - ales for order , - inales for suborder , - aceae for family , - oidease for subfamily , a greek - based name for genus , and a latin - based name for species
the primary classification of algae is based on certain morphological features
the chief among these are ( a ) pigment constitution of the cell , ( b ) chemical nature of stored food materials , ( c ) kind , number , point of insertion and relative length of the flagella on the motile cell , ( d ) chemical composition of cell wall and ( e ) presence or absence of a definitely organized nucleus in the cell or any other significant details of cell structure
although carolus linnaeus ( 1754 ) included algae along with lichens in his 25th class cryptogamia , he did not elaborate further on the classification of algae
jean pierre étienne vaucher ( 1803 ) was perhaps the first to propose a system of classification of algae , and he recognized three groups , conferves , ulves , and tremelles
while johann heinrich friedrich link ( 1820 ) classified algae on the basis of the colour of the pigment and structure , william henry harvey ( 1836 ) proposed a system of classification on the basis of the habitat and the pigment
agardh ( 1849–1898 ) divided algae into six orders diatomaceae , nostochineae , confervoideae , ulvaceae , floriadeae and fucoideae
around 1880 , algae along with fungi were grouped under thallophyta , a division created by eichler ( 1836 )
encouraged by this , adolf engler and karl prantl ( 1912 ) proposed a revised scheme of classification of algae and included fungi in algae as they were of opinion that fungi have been derived from algae
the scheme proposed by engler and prantl is summarised as follows
the algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria
chloroplasts contain circular dna like that in cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria
however , the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae , reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events
the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae
their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right
many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic
some retain plastids , but not chloroplasts , while others have lost plastids entirely
these groups have green chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and b
their chloroplasts are surrounded by four and three membranes , respectively , and were probably retained from ingested green algae
chlorarachniophytes , which belong to the phylum cercozoa , contain a small nucleomorph , which is a relict of the algaes nucleus
euglenids , which belong to the phylum euglenozoa , live primarily in fresh water and have chloroplasts with only three membranes
the endosymbiotic green algae may have been acquired through myzocytosis rather than phagocytosis
these groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and c , and phycobilins
the shape can vary ; they may be of discoid , plate - like , reticulate , cup - shaped , spiral , or ribbon shaped
they have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch
the latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts , but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there
in the first three of these groups ( chromista ) , the chloroplast has four membranes , retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads , and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor , although other evidence casts doubt on whether the heterokonts , haptophyta , and cryptomonads are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups
the typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes , but considerable diversity exists in chloroplasts within the group , and a number of endosymbiotic events apparently occurred
the apicomplexa , a group of closely related parasites , also have plastids called apicoplasts , which are not photosynthetic , but appear to have a common origin with dinoflagellate chloroplasts
linnaeus , in species plantarum ( 1753 ) , in systema naturae , linnaeus described the genera volvox and corallina , and a species of acetabularia ( as madrepora ) , among the animals
in 1768 , samuel gottlieb gmelin ( 1744–1774 ) published the historia fucorum , the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of linnaeus
it included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves
at this time , microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers ( for example , müller and ehrenberg ) studying the infusoria ( microscopic organisms )
unlike macroalgae , which were clearly viewed as plants , microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile
even the nonmotile ( coccoid ) microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants , macroalgae , or animals
although used as a taxonomic category in some pre - darwinian classifications , for example , linnaeus ( 1753 ) , de jussieu ( 1789 ) , horaninow ( 1843 ) , agassiz ( 1859 ) , wilson cassin ( 1864 ) , in further classifications , the algae are seen as an artificial , polyphyletic group
throughout the 20th century , most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae cyanophytes , rhodophytes , chrysophytes , xanthophytes , bacillariophytes , phaeophytes , pyrrhophytes ( cryptophytes and dinophytes ) , euglenophytes , and chlorophytes
later , many new groups were discovered ( for example , bolidophyceae ) , and others were splintered from older groups charophytes and glaucophytes ( from chlorophytes ) , many heterokontophytes ( for example , synurophytes from chrysophytes , or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes ) , haptophytes ( from chrysophytes ) , and chlorarachniophytes ( from xanthophytes )
with the abandonment of plant - animal dichotomous classification , most groups of algae ( sometimes all ) were included in protista , later also abandoned in favour of eukaryota
however , as a legacy of the older plant life scheme , some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications ( see ambiregnal protists )
some parasitic algae ( for example , the green algae prototheca and helicosporidium , parasites of metazoans , or cephaleuros , parasites of plants ) were originally classified as fungi , sporozoans , or protistans of incertae sedis , some filamentous bacteria ( for example , beggiatoa ) were originally seen as algae
furthermore , groups like the apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids , but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae
the first land plants probably evolved from shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like chara almost 500million years ago
these probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations and were probably filamentous
fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475million years ago
a range of algal morphologies is exhibited , and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common
the only groups to exhibit three - dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns , and some chlorophytes
apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups the florideophyte reds , various browns , and the charophytes
the form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns , because they have distinct nodes , separated by internode stems ; whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes
conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait ; they appear in the coralline algae and the hildenbrandiales , as well as the browns
most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids , but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups
some of the more common organizational levels , more than one of which may occur in the lifecycle of a species , are
in three lines , even higher levels of organization have been reached , with full tissue differentiation
these are the brown algae , —the red algae , the most complex forms are found among the charophyte algae ( see charales and charophyta ) , in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants
the innovation that defines these nonalgal plants is the presence of female reproductive organs with protective cell layers that protect the zygote and developing embryo
hence , the land plants are referred to as the embryophytes
the term algal turf is commonly used but poorly defined
algal turfs are thick , carpet - like beds of seaweed that retain sediment and compete with foundation species like corals and kelps , and they are usually less than 15cm tall
such a turf may consist of one or more species , and will generally cover an area in the order of a square metre or more
some common characteristics are listed
many algae , particularly members of the characeae species , salt tolerance , cytoplasmic streaming , and the generation of action potentials
some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms in these symbioses , the algae supply photosynthates ( organic substances ) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells
the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae
examples are
lichens are defined by the international association for lichenology to be an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure
one mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species , rarely two , from the green algae , except that alternatively , the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria ( hence photobiont is the more accurate term )
a photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently ; accordingly , lichens are named and classified as fungal species
the association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone ( they can be experimentally isolated )
the photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont
trentepohlia is an example of a common green alga genus worldwide that can grow on its own or be lichenised
lichen thus share some of the habitat and often similar appearance with specialized species of algae ( aerophytes ) growing on exposed surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks and sometimes discoloring them
endosymbiontic green algae live close to the surface of some sponges , for example , breadcrumb sponges ( halichondria panicea )
the alga is thus protected from predators ; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80 of sponge growth in some species
rhodophyta , chlorophyta , and heterokontophyta , the three main algal divisions , have lifecycles which show considerable variation and complexity
in general , an asexual phase exists where the seaweeds cells are diploid , a sexual phase where the cells are haploid , followed by fusion of the male and female gametes
asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases , but less variation is possible
commonly , in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae , two specialized , sexually compatible , haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a zygote
to ensure a successful mating , the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated ; pheromones may play a key role in these processes
however , sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction
the algal collection of the us national herbarium ( located in the national museum of natural history ) consists of approximately 320 , 500 dried specimens , which , although not exhaustive ( no exhaustive collection exists ) , gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species ( that number remains unknown )
estimates vary widely
for example , according to one standard textbook , in the british isles the uk biodiversity steering group report estimated there to be 20 , 000 algal species in the uk
another checklist reports only about 5 , 000 species
regarding the difference of about 15 , 000 species , the text concludes it will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species
and so on , but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources , these numbers have no more credibility than the british ones mentioned above
most estimates also omit microscopic algae , such as phytoplankton
the distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid - 19th century
algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of plantae by seeds and spores
this dispersal can be accomplished by air , water , or other organisms due to this , spores can be found in a variety of environments fresh and marine waters , air , soil , and in or on other organisms whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands
the spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind , as well as by living carriers
however , not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae , as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them
marine spores are often spread by ocean currents
ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability , resulting in phytogeographic zones , regions , and provinces
to some degree , the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features , such as antarctica , long distances of ocean or general land masses
it is , therefore , possible to identify species occurring by locality , such as pacific algae or north sea algae
when they occur out of their localities , hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible , such as the hulls of ships
for example , ulva reticulata and fasciata travelled from the mainland to hawaii in this manner
mapping is possible for select species only there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns
for example , clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there
however , scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the difficulties of undertaking such studies
algae are prominent in bodies of water , common in terrestrial environments , and are found in unusual environments , such as on snow and ice
seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters , under
a type of algae , ancylonema nordenskioeldii , was found in greenland in areas known as the dark zone , which caused an increase in the rate of melting ice sheet
the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology
microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column ( phytoplankton ) provide the food base for most marine food chains
in very high densities ( algal blooms ) , these algae may discolor the water and outcompete , poison , or asphyxiate other life forms
algae can be used as indicator organisms to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems in many cases , algal metabolism is sensitive to various pollutants
due to this , the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants
to detect these changes , algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease
on the basis of their habitat , algae can be categorized as aquatic ( planktonic , benthic , marine , freshwater , lentic , lotic ) , lithophytic , halophytic ( or euryhaline ) , psammon , thermophilic , cryophilic , epibiont ( epiphytic , epizoic ) , endosymbiont ( endophytic , endozoic ) , parasitic , calcifilic or lichenic ( phycobiont )
in classical chinese , the word is used both for algae and ( in the modest tradition of the imperial scholars ) for literary talent
the third island in kunming lake beside the summer palace in beijing is known as the zaojian tang dao , which thus simultaneously means island of the algae - viewing hall and island of the hall for reflecting on literary talent
agar , a gelatinous substance derived from red algae , has a number of commercial uses
it is a good medium on which to grow bacteria and fungi , as most microorganisms cannot digest agar
alginic acid , or alginate , is extracted from brown algae
its uses range from gelling agents in food , to medical dressings
alginic acid also has been used in the field of biotechnology as a biocompatible medium for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization
molecular cuisine is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties , by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours
between 100 , 000 and 170 , 000 wet tons of macrocystis are harvested annually in new mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed
to be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from ( local ) policy on the long run , biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels
here , algae - based fuels hold great promise , directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass
the break - even point for algae - based biofuels is estimated to occur by 2025
for centuries , seaweed has been used as a fertilizer ; george owen of henllys writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in south wales
today , algae are used by humans in many ways ; for example , as fertilizers , soil conditioners , and livestock feed
aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds
algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places
maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner
naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food , especially in asia , leading some to label them as superfoods
in addition , commercially cultivated microalgae , including both algae and cyanobacteria , are marketed as nutritional supplements , such as spirulina , chlorella and the vitamin - c supplement from dunaliella , high in beta - carotene
algae are national foods of many nations china consumes more than 70 species , including fat choy , a cyanobacterium considered a vegetable ; japan , over 20 species such as nori and aonori ; laver is used to make laver bread in wales , where it is known as
it is also used along the west coast of north america from california to british columbia , in hawaii and by the māori of new zealand
sea lettuce and badderlocks are salad ingredients in scotland , ireland , greenland , and iceland
algae is being considered a potential solution for world hunger problem
furthermore , it contains all nine of the essential amino acids the body does not produce on its own
the oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids
for example , parietochloris incisa is very high in arachidonic acid , where it reaches up to 47 of the triglyceride pool
algae have emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega - 3 fatty acids for vegetarians who cannot get long - chain epa and dha from other vegetarian sources such as flaxseed oil , which only contains the short - chain alpha - linolenic acid ( ala )
agricultural research service scientists found that 60–90 of nitrogen runoff and 70–100 of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber , also called an algal turf scrubber ( ats )
scientists developed the ats , which consists of shallow , 100 - foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form , and studied its efficacy for three years
they found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers , streams , and oceans
researchers collected and dried the nutrient - rich algae from the ats and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer
they found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ats organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers
algae scrubbers , using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions , are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds
various polymers can be created from algae , which can be especially useful in the creation of bioplastics
these include hybrid plastics , cellulose - based plastics , poly - lactic acid , and bio - polyethylene
and in surf boards
the alga stichococcus bacillaris has been seen to colonize silicone resins used at archaeological sites ; biodegrading the synthetic substance
the natural pigments ( carotenoids and chlorophylls ) produced by algae can be used as alternatives to chemical dyes and coloring agents
the presence of some individual algal pigments , together with specific pigment concentration ratios , are taxon - specific analysis of their concentrations with various analytical methods , particularly high - performance liquid chromatography , can therefore offer deep insight into the taxonomic composition and relative abundance of natural algae populations in sea water samples
analysis of variance ( anova ) is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures ( such as the variation among and between groups ) used to analyze the differences among means
anova was developed by the statistician ronald fisher
anova is based on the law of total variance , where the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation
in its simplest form , anova provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal , and therefore generalizes the t - test beyond two means
in other words , the anova is used to test the difference between two or more means
while the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century , antecedents extend centuries into the past according to stigler
these include hypothesis testing , the partitioning of sums of squares , experimental techniques and the additive model
laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s
around 1800 , laplace and gauss developed the least - squares method for combining observations , which improved upon methods then used in astronomy and geodesy
it also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares
laplace knew how to estimate a variance from a residual ( rather than a total ) sum of squares
by 1827 , laplace was using least squares methods to address anova problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides
before 1800 , astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting
from reaction times ( the personal equation ) and had developed methods of reducing the errors
the experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology which developed strong ( full factorial ) experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added
an eloquent non - mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was available in 1885
ronald fisher introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis in a 1918 article the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance
his first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921
analysis of variance became widely known after being included in fishers 1925 book statistical methods for research workers
randomization models were developed by several researchers
the first was published in polish by jerzy neyman in 1923
in the illustrations to the right , groups are identified as x1 , x2 , etcetera in the first illustration , the dogs are divided according to the product ( interaction ) of two binary groupings young vs old , and short - haired vs long - haired ( for example , group 1 is young , short - haired dogs , group 2 is young , long - haired dogs , etcetera )
since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups ( shown in blue ) has a relatively large variance , and since the means are very similar across groups , grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights knowing which group a dog is in doesnt allow us to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the dog is in a dog show
thus , this grouping fails to explain the variation in the overall distribution ( yellow - orange )
an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as pet vs working breed and less athletic vs more athletic would probably be somewhat more successful ( fair fit )
the heaviest show dogs are likely to be big , strong , working breeds , while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter
as shown by the second illustration , the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case , and the means are more distinguishable
however , the significant overlap of distributions , for example , means that we cannot distinguish x1 and x2 reliably
grouping dogs according to a coin flip might produce distributions that look similar
an attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit
all chihuahuas are light and all st bernards are heavy
the difference in weights between setters and pointers does not justify separate breeds
the analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments
a common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models
the method has some advantages over correlation not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship
the fixed - effects model ( class i ) of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the response variable values change
this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole
random - effects model ( class ii ) is used when the treatments are not fixed
this occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population
because the levels themselves are random variables , some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments ( a multi - variable generalization of simple differences ) differ from the fixed - effects model
a mixed - effects model ( class iii ) contains experimental factors of both fixed and random - effects types , with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types
teaching experiments could be performed by a college or university department to find a good introductory textbook , with each text considered a treatment
the fixed - effects model would compare a list of candidate texts
the random - effects model would determine whether important differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts
the mixed - effects model would compare the ( fixed ) incumbent texts to randomly selected alternatives
defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive , with competing definitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire
the analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches , the most common of which uses a linear model that relates the response to the treatments and blocks
note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels
interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data
the analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a linear model , which makes the following assumptions about the probability distribution of the responsescite book title statistical methods
the separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the errors are independently , identically , and normally distributed for fixed effects models , that is , that the errors ( varepsilon ) are independent and
in a randomized controlled experiment , the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units , following the experimental protocol
this randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out
the objective random - assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis , following the ideas of peirce and ronald fisher
this design - based analysis was discussed and developed by francis anscombe at rothamsted experimental station and by oscar kempthorne at iowa state university
kempthorne and his students make an assumption of unit treatment additivity , which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and david cox
in its simplest form , the assumption of unit - treatment additivityunit - treatment additivity is simply termed additivity in most texts
hinkelmann and kempthorne add adjectives and distinguish between additivity in the strict and broad senses
this allows a detailed consideration of multiple error sources ( treatment , state , selection , measurement and sampling ) on page 161
states that the observed response yi , j from experimental unit i when receiving treatment j can be written as the sum of the units response yi and the treatment - effect tj , that is cox ( 1958 , chapter 2 some key assumptions )
the assumption of unit - treatment additivity implies that , for every treatment j , the jth treatment has exactly the same effect tj on every experiment unit
the assumption of unit treatment additivity usually cannot be directly falsified , according to cox and kempthorne
however , many consequences of treatment - unit additivity can be falsified
for a randomized experiment , the assumption of unit - treatment additivity implies that the variance is constant for all treatments
therefore , by contraposition , a necessary condition for unit - treatment additivity is that the variance is constant
the use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design - based inference that is standard in finite - population survey sampling
kempthorne uses the randomization - distribution and the assumption of unit treatment additivity to produce a derived linear model , very similar to the textbook model discussed previously
hinkelmann and kempthorne ( 2008 , volume 1 , section 6
completely randomized design ; derived linear model ) the test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model , according to approximation theorems and simulation studies
hinkelmann and kempthorne ( 2008 , volume 1 , section 6 completely randomized design ; approximating the randomization test ) however , there are differences
for example , the randomization - based analysis results in a small but ( strictly ) negative correlation between the observations
in the randomization - based analysis , there is no assumption of a normal distribution and certainly no assumption of independence
on the contrary , the observations are dependent
the randomization - based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time
since the randomization - based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model , most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach
few statisticians object to model - based analysis of balanced randomized experiments
however , when applied to data from non - randomized experiments or observational studies , model - based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization
the experimenter must decide which of the various causes that he feels will produce variations in his results must be controlled
those causes that he does not control experimentally , because he is not cognizant of them , he must control by the device of randomization
only when the treatments in the experiment are applied by the experimenter using the full randomization procedure is the chain of inductive inference sound
it is only under these circumstances that the experimenter can attribute whatever effects he observes to the treatment and the treatment only
under these circumstances his conclusions are reliable in the statistical sense
for observational data , the derivation of confidence intervals must use subjective models , as emphasized by ronald fisher and his followers
in practice , the estimates of treatment - effects from observational studies generally are often inconsistent
in practice , statistical models and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public
the normal - model based anova analysis assumes the independence , normality , and homogeneity of variances of the residuals
the randomization - based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the variances of the residuals ( as a consequence of unit - treatment additivity ) and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment
both these analyses require homoscedasticity , as an assumption for the normal - model analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization - based analysis
however , studies of processes that change variances rather than means ( called dispersion effects ) have been successfully conducted using anova
there are no necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality , but the f - test used for anova hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical
problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions
the property of unit - treatment additivity is not invariant under a change of scale , so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit - treatment additivity
if the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions , then the statistician may specify ( in the protocol for the experiment or observational study ) that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance
also , a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses , which are believed to follow a multiplicative model
according to cauchys functional equation theorem , the logarithm is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition
anova is used in the analysis of comparative experiments , those in which only the difference in outcomes is of interest
the statistical significance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two variances
this ratio is independent of several possible alterations to the experimental observations adding a constant to all observations does not alter significance
multiplying all observations by a constant does not alter significance
so anova statistical significance result is independent of constant bias and scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations
in the era of mechanical calculation it was common to subtract a constant from all observations ( when equivalent to dropping leading digits ) to simplify data entry
this is an example of data coding
the calculations of anova can be characterized as computing a number of means and variances , dividing two variances and comparing the ratio to a handbook value to determine statistical significance
calculating a treatment effect is then trivial the effect of any treatment is estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the observations which receive the treatment and the general mean
anova uses traditional standardized terminology
the definitional equation of sample variance is s2 frac1n - 1 sumi ( yi - bary ) 2 , where the divisor is called the degrees of freedom ( df ) , the summation is called
the sum of squares ( ss ) , the result is called the mean square ( ms ) and the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean
anova estimates 3 sample variances a total variance based on all the observation deviations from the grand mean , an error variance based on all the observation deviations from their appropriate treatment means , and a treatment variance
the treatment variance is based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean , the result being multiplied by the number of observations in each treatment to account for the difference between the variance of observations and the variance of means
the fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares ss into components related to the effects used in the model
for example , the model for a simplified anova with one type of treatment at different levels
the number of degrees of freedom df can be partitioned in a similar way one of these components ( that for error ) specifies a chi - squared distribution which describes the associated sum of squares , while the same is true for treatments if there is no treatment effect
the f - test is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation
for example , in one - way , or single - factor anova , statistical significance is tested for by comparing the f test statistic
to the f - distribution with i - 1 , nt - i degrees of freedom
using the f - distribution is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled chi - squared distribution
the expected value of f is 1 n sigma2texttreatment ( where n is the treatment sample size ) which is 1 for no treatment effect
as values of f increase above 1 , the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis
two apparent experimental methods of increasing f are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls
there are two methods of concluding the anova hypothesis test , both of which produce the same result
the anova f - test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors ( that is maximizing power for a fixed significance level )
for example , to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect , the f - tests p - values closely approximate the permutation tests p - values the approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced
such permutation tests characterize tests with maximum power against all alternative hypotheses , as observed by rosenbaum
rosenbaum ( 2002 , page 40 ) cites section 5 ( permutation tests ) , theorem 2 ( actually theorem 3 , page 184 ) of lehmanns testing statistical hypotheses ( 1959 )
the anova f - test ( of the null - hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect ) is recommended as a practical test , because of its robustness against many alternative distributions
the f - test for the comparison of variances has a mixed reputation
is not recommended as a hypothesis test to determine whether two different samples have the same variance
it is recommended for anova where two estimates of the variance of the same sample are compared
while the f - test is not generally robust against departures from normality , it has been found to be robust in the special case of anova
citations from moore mccabe ( 2003 ) analysis of variance uses f statistics , but these are not the same as the f statistic for comparing two population standard deviations
( page 554 ) the f test and other procedures for inference about variances are so lacking in robustness as to be of little use in practice
( page 556 ) the anova f - test is relatively insensitive to moderate nonnormality and unequal variances , especially when the sample sizes are similar
( page 763 ) anova assumes homoscedasticity , but it is robust
the statistical test for homoscedasticity ( the f - test ) is not robust
moore mccabe recommend a rule of thumb
anova consists of separable parts ; partitioning sources of variance and hypothesis testing can be used individually
anova is used to support other statistical tools
regression is first used to fit more complex models to data , then anova is used to compare models with the objective of selecting simple ( r ) models that adequately describe the data
such models could be fit without any reference to anova , but anova tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models , and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients
gelman ( 2008 ) we think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring multilevel models—not as an alternative to regression but as a tool for summarizing complex high - dimensional inferences
the simplest experiment suitable for anova analysis is the completely randomized experiment with a single factor
more complex experiments with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include completely randomized blocks and latin squares ( and variants graeco - latin squares , etcetera )
the more complex experiments share many of the complexities of multiple factors
a relatively complete discussion of the analysis ( models , data summaries , anova table ) of the completely randomized experiment is available
that is , we envision an additive model that says every data point can be represented by summing three quantities the true mean , averaged over all factor levels being investigated , plus an incremental component associated with the particular column ( factor level ) , plus a final component associated with everything else affecting that specific data value
anova generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors
when the experiment includes observations at all combinations of levels of each factor , it is termed factorial
factorial experiments are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the efficiency grows as the number of factors increases
( 2001 , section 5 - 2 introduction to factorial designs ; the advantages of factorials ) consequently , factorial designs are heavily used
the use of anova to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication
in a 3 - way anova with factors x , y and z , the anova model includes terms for the main effects ( x , y , z ) and terms for interactions ( xy , xz , yz , xyz )
all terms require hypothesis tests
the proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance
fortunately , experience says that high order interactions are rare
the ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple factor anova
testing one factor at a time hides interactions , but produces apparently inconsistent experimental results
caution is advised when encountering interactions ; test interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond anova if interactions are found
texts vary in their recommendations regarding the continuation of the anova procedure after encountering an interaction
interactions complicate the interpretation of experimental data
neither the calculations of significance nor the estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value
a significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects
graphical methods are recommended to enhance understanding
regression is often useful
a lengthy discussion of interactions is available in cox ( 1958 )
some interactions can be removed ( by transformations ) while others cannot
a variety of techniques are used with multiple factor anova to reduce expense
one technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication ( possibly no replication with support of analytical trickery ) and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically ( or practically ) insignificant
an experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications
some analysis is required in support of the design of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses
because experimentation is iterative , the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments
in the design of an experiment , the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment
experimentation is often sequential
early experiments are often designed to provide mean - unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error
later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude ; in this case , the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power , among other goals
reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology
provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions
the analysis , which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted , is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards
besides the power analysis , there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units
these include graphical methods based on limiting the probability of false negative errors , graphical methods based on an expected variation increase ( above the residuals ) and methods based on achieving a desired confidence interval
power analysis is often applied in the context of anova in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain anova design , effect size in the population , sample size and significance level
power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true
several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for anova to summarize the strength of the association between a predictor ( s ) and the dependent variable or the overall standardized difference of the complete model
standardized effect - size estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines
however , while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature , a non - standardized measure of effect size that has immediately meaningful units may be preferable for reporting purposes
wilkinson ( 1999 , p 599 )
sometimes tests are conducted to determine whether the assumptions of anova appear to be violated
residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity and gross normality
residuals should have the appearance of ( zero mean normal distribution ) noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and
a statistically significant effect in anova is often followed by additional tests
this can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses
follow - up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned ( a priori ) or post hoc
planned tests are determined before looking at the data , and post hoc tests are conceived only after looking at the data ( though the term post hoc is inconsistently used )
the follow - up tests may be simple pairwise comparisons of individual group means or may be compound comparisons ( for example , comparing the mean pooling across groups a , b and c to the mean of group d )
comparisons can also look at tests of trend , such as linear and quadratic relationships , when the independent variable involves ordered levels
often the follow - up tests incorporate a method of adjusting for the multiple comparisons problem
there are several types of anova
many statisticians base anova on the design of the experiment , especially on the protocol that specifies the random assignment of treatments to subjects ; the protocols description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any blocking
it is also common to apply anova to observational data using an appropriate statistical model
balanced experiments ( those with an equal sample size for each treatment ) are relatively easy to interpret ; unbalanced experiments offer more complexity
for single - factor ( one - way ) anova , the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy , but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power
for more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications
the orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case
this means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply
consequently , the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs
in the general case , the analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data , but then the sums of squares , mean squares , and f - ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation are considered
anova is ( in part ) a test of statistical significance
the american psychological association ( and many other organisations ) holds the view that simply reporting statistical significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred
anova is considered to be a special case of linear regression which in turn is a special case of the general linear model
all consider the observations to be the sum of a model ( fit ) and a residual ( error ) to be minimized
the kruskal–wallis test and the friedman test are nonparametric tests , which do not rely on an assumption of normality
linearly re - order the data so that k - th observation is associated with a response yk and factors zk , b where b in 1 , 2 , ldots , b denotes the different factors and b is the total number of factors
in one - way anova b1 and in two - way anova b 2
furthermore , we assume the b - th factor has ib levels , namely 1 , 2 , ldots , ib
now , we can one - hot encode the factors into the sumb1b ib dimensional vector vk
the one - hot encoding function gb 1 , 2 , ldots , ib mapsto 0 , 1ib is defined such that the i - th entry of gb ( zk , b ) is
the vector vk is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all b
thus , vk g1 ( zk , 1 ) , g2 ( zk , 2 ) , ldots , gb ( zk , b )
in order to obtain a fully general b - way interaction anova we must also concatenate every additional interaction term in the vector vk and then add an intercept term
let that vector be xk
with this notation in place , we now have the exact connection with linear regression
we simply regress response yk against the vector xk
however , there is a concern about identifiability
in order to overcome such issues we assume that the sum of the parameters within each set of interactions is equal to zero
from here , one can use f - statistics or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors
we can consider the 2 - way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has 2 levels and the second factor has 3 levels
define ai 1 if zk , 1i and bi 1 if zk , 2 i , that is a is the one - hot encoding of the first factor and b is the one - hot encoding of the second factor
xk a1 , a2 , b1 , b2 , b3 , a1 times b1 , a1 times b2 , a1 times b3 , a2 times b1 , a2 times b2 , a2 times b3 , 1
in organic chemistry , an alkane , or paraffin ( a historical trivial name that also has other meanings ) , is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon
in other words , an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure in which all the carbon–carbon bonds are single
alkanes have the general chemical formula ) , where n1 ( sometimes called the parent molecule ) , to arbitrarily large and complex molecules , like pentacontane
the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) defines alkanes as acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula despite their having a distinct general formula ( that is cycloalkanes are )
in an alkane , each carbon atom is sp3 - hybridized with 4 sigma bonds ( either c–c or c–h ) , and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms ( in a c–h bond )
the longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its carbon skeleton or carbon backbone
the number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane
one group of the higher alkanes are waxes , solids at standard ambient temperature and pressure ( satp ) , for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17
with their repeated – units , the alkanes constitute a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ in molecular mass by multiples of 14u ( the total mass of each such methylene - bridge unit , which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 12u and two hydrogen atoms of mass 1u each )
methane is produced by methanogenic bacteria and some long - chain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi
nevertheless , most alkanes do not have much biological activity
they can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active / reactive functional groups of biological molecules
an alkyl group is an alkane - based molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding
they are generally abbreviated with the symbol for any organyl group , r , although alk is sometimes used to specifically symbolize an alkyl group ( as opposed to an alkenyl group or aryl group )
saturated hydrocarbons can be linear , branched , or cyclic
the third group is sometimes called cycloalkanes
very complicated structures are possible by combining linear , branch , cyclic alkanes
alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various ways , forming structural isomers
the simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches
this isomer is sometimes called the n - isomer ( n for normal , although it is not necessarily the most common )
however , the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points
the number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms for example , for acyclic alkaneson - line encyclopedia of integer sequences
branched alkanes can be chiral
for example , 3 - methylhexane and its higher homologues are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number 3
the above list only includes differences of connectivity , not stereochemistry
in addition to the alkane isomers , the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more rings
such compounds are called cycloalkanes , and are also excluded from the above list because changing the number of rings changes the molecular formula
for example , cyclobutane and methylcyclopropane are isomers of each other ( c4h8 ) , but are not isomers of butane ( c4h10 )
the iupac nomenclature ( systematic way of naming compounds ) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains
unbranched , saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix - ane
in 1866 , august wilhelm von hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a , e , i , o and u to create suffixes - ane , - ene , - ine ( or - yne ) , - one , - une , for the hydrocarbons cnh2n2 , cnh2n , cnh2n−2 , cnh2n−4 , cnh2n−6
in modern nomenclature , the first three specifically name hydrocarbons with single , double and triple bonds ; while - one now represents a ketone
straight - chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix n - or n - ( for normal ) where a non - linear isomer exists
although this is not strictly necessary and is not part of the iupac naming system , the usage is still common in cases where one wishes to emphasize or distinguish between the straight - chain and branched - chain isomers , for example , n - butane rather than simply butane to differentiate it from isobutane
alternative names for this group used in the petroleum industry are linear paraffins or n - paraffins
the first four names were derived from methanol , ether , propionic acid and butyric acid
alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix - ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel ( - a or - o ) from the basic numerical term
hence , pentane , c5h12 ; hexane , c6h14 ; heptane , c7h16 ; octane , c8h18 ; etcetera the numeral prefix is generally greek , however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine , for example nonane , use the latin prefix non -
for a more complete list , see list of straight - chain alkanes
simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes , for example n - pentane , isopentane , and neopentane
though technically distinct from the alkanes , this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the cyclic alkanes
as their description implies , they contain one or more rings
simple cycloalkanes have a prefix cyclo - to distinguish them from alkanes
cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones , for example , cyclopentane ( c5h10 ) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like pentane ( c5h12 ) , but they are joined up in a five - membered ring
in a similar manner , propane and cyclopropane , butane and cyclobutane , etcetera
substituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes – the cycloalkane ring is stated , and the substituents are according to their position on the ring , with the numbering decided by the cahn–ingold–prelog priority rules
the trivial ( non - systematic ) name for alkanes is paraffins
together , alkanes are known as the paraffin series
trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts
they were coined before the development of systematic names , and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry
cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes
branched - chain alkanes are called isoparaffins
paraffin is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers , that is , compounds of the same chemical formula , for example , pentane and isopentane
alkanes experience intermolecular van der waals forces
stronger intermolecular van der waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes
under standard conditions , from ch4 to c4h10 alkanes are gaseous ; from c5h12 to c17h36 they are liquids ; and after c18h38 they are solids
as the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight , it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size ( molecular weight ) of the molecule
as a rule of thumb , the boiling point rises 20–30°c for each carbon added to the chain ; this rule applies to other homologous series
a straight - chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched - chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact , thus the greater van der waals forces , between adjacent molecules
for example , compare isobutane ( 2 - methylpropane ) and n - butane ( butane ) , which boil at −12 and 0°c , and 2 , 2 - dimethylbutane and 2 , 3 - dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58°c , respectively
on the other hand , cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules , which give a plane of intermolecular contact
the melting points of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above
that is , ( all other things being equal ) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point
there is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points
solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids
this rigid structure requires energy to break down
thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart
for alkanes , this can be seen from the graph above ( that is , the blue line )
the odd - numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes
this is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase , forming a well - organized structure , which requires more energy to break apart
the odd - numbered alkanes pack less well and so the looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart
for a visualization of the crystal structures see
the melting points of branched - chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight - chain alkanes , again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase
alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way , nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field
for this reason , they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water
since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule , the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order ( a reduction in entropy )
as there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules , the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water alkanes are said to be hydrophobic as they are insoluble in water
their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively high , a property that is called lipophilicity
alkanes are , for example , miscible in all proportions among themselves
the density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water
hence , alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane–water mixture
the molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics
it is derived from the electron configuration of carbon , which has four valence electrons
the carbon atoms in alkanes are described as sp3 hybrids , that is to say that , to a good approximation , the valence electrons are in orbitals directed towards the corners of a tetrahedron which are derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals
geometrically , the angle between the bonds are cos−1 ( − ) ≈109°
this is exact for the case of methane , while larger alkanes containing a combination of c–h and c–c bonds generally have bonds that are within several degrees of this idealized value
an alkane has only c–h and c–c single bonds
the former result from the overlap of an sp3 orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen ; the latter by the overlap of two sp3 orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms the bond lengths amount to 1×10−10m for a c–h bond and 1×10−10m for a c–c bond
the spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp3 orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged , with an angle of 109° between them
structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another , while both common and useful , do not accurately depict the geometry
the structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule
there is a further degree of freedom for each carbon–carbon bond the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond
the spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation
ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes , as there is only one c–c bond
if one looks down the axis of the c–c bond , one will see the so - called newman projection
the hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them , resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane
however , the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360°
this is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond
despite this apparent freedom , only two limiting conformations are important eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation
the two conformations differ in energy the staggered conformation is 12kj / mol ( 3 kcal / mol ) lower in energy ( more stable ) than the eclipsed conformation ( the least stable )
this difference in energy between the two conformations , known as the torsion energy , is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature
there is constant rotation about the c–c bond
the time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next , equivalent to the rotation of one ch3 group by 120° relative to the other , is of the order of 10−11seconds
the case of higher alkanes is more complex but based on similar principles , with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon–carbon bond
for this reason , alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models
the actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms , as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules alkane molecules have no fixed structural form , whatever the models may suggest
virtually all organic compounds contain carbon–carbon , and carbon–hydrogen bonds , and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra
alkanes are notable for having no other groups , and therefore for the absence of other characteristic spectroscopic features of a functional group like –oh , –cho , –cooh etcetera
the carbon–hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960cm−1 , while the carbon–carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300cm−1
the carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at 1450cm−1 and 1375cm−1 , while methylene groups show bands at 1465cm−1 and 1450cm−1
carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725cm−1
the proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at δh 0–1
the carbon - 13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon δc 8–30 ( primary , methyl , –ch3 ) , 15–55 ( secondary , methylene , –ch2– ) , 20–60 ( tertiary , methyne , c–h ) and quaternary
the carbon - 13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak , due to the lack of nuclear overhauser effect and the long relaxation time , and can be missed in weak samples , or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time
alkanes have a high ionization energy , and the molecular ion is usually weak
the fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret , but , in the case of branched chain alkanes , the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals
the fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group ( m−15 ) is often absent , and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units , corresponding to sequential loss of ch2 groups
alkanes are only weakly reactive with most chemical compounds
the acid dissociation constant ( pka ) values of all alkanes are estimated to range from 50 to 70 , depending on the extrapolation method , hence they are extremely weak acids that are practically inert to bases ( see carbon acids )
they are also extremely weak bases , undergoing no observable protonation in pure sulfuric acid ( h0 −12 ) , although superacids that are at least millions of times stronger have been known to protonate them to give hypercoordinate alkanium ions ( see methanium ion )
similarly , they only show reactivity with the strongest of electrophilic reagents ( for example , dioxiranes and salts containing the nf4 cation )
by virtue of their strongly c–h bonds ( 100 kcal / mol ) and c–c bonds ( 90 kcal / mol , but usually less sterically accessible ) , they are also relatively unreactive toward free radicals , although many electron - deficient radicals will react with alkanes in the absence of other electron - rich bonds ( see below )
this inertness is the source of the term paraffins ( with the meaning here of lacking affinity )
in crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years
free radicals , molecules with unpaired electrons , play a large role in most reactions of alkanes , such as cracking and reformation where long - chain alkanes are converted into shorter - chain alkanes and straight - chain alkanes into branched - chain isomers
moreover , redox reactions of alkanes involving free radical intermediates , in particular with oxygen and the halogens , are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced state ; in the case of methane , carbon is in its lowest possible oxidation state ( −4 )
reaction with oxygen ( if present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction stoichiometry ) leads to combustion without any smoke , producing carbon dioxide and water
free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens , leading to the production of haloalkanes
in addition , alkanes have been shown to interact with , and bind to , certain transition metal complexes in c–h bond activation reactions
in highly branched alkanes , the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value ( 109° ) to accommodate bulky groups
such distortions introduce a tension in the molecule , known as steric hindrance or strain
strain substantially increases reactivity
however , in general and perhaps surprisingly , when branching is not extensive enough to make highly disfavorable 1 , 2 - and 1 , 3 - alkyl–alkyl steric interactions ( worth 3 kcal / mol and 3 kcal / mol in the case of the eclipsing conformations of butane and pentane , respectively ) unavoidable , the branched alkanes are actually more thermodynamically stable than their linear ( or less branched ) isomers
for example , the highly branched 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 - tetramethylbutane is about 1 kcal / mol more stable than its linear isomer , n - octane
destabilization of linear alkanes by steric repulsion , and / or electrostatic effects
all alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction , although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases
the general equation for complete combustion is
or cnh2n2 o2 → ( n1 ) h2o nco2
the standard enthalpy change of combustion , δch⊖ , for alkanes increases by about 650kj / mol per ch2 group
branched - chain alkanes have lower values of δch⊖ than straight - chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms , and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable
alkanes react with halogens in a so - called free radical halogenation reaction
the hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms free radicals are the reactive species that participate in the reaction , which usually leads to a mixture of products
the reaction is highly exothermic with halogen fluorine and can lead to an explosion
these reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons
there are three steps
experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers , indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction
the mixture produced , however , is not a statistical mixture secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free - radicals
an example can be seen in the monobromination of propane
cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones
this can be done with a thermal or catalytic method
the thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of free radicals
the catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts ( usually solid acids such as silica - alumina and zeolites ) , which promote a heterolytic ( asymmetric ) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges , usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion
carbon - localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement , c–c scission in position beta ( that is , cracking ) and intra - and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer
in both types of processes , the corresponding reactive intermediates ( radicals , ions ) are permanently regenerated , and thus they proceed by a self - propagating chain mechanism
the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination
dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes
isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight - chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a platinum catalyst
in isomerization , the alkanes become branched - chain isomers
in other words , it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens , keeping the same molecular weight
in reformation , the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons , giving off hydrogen as a by - product
both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance
butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization , as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers
alkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen
alkanes can be chlorosulfonated and nitrated , although both reactions require special conditions
the fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance
in the reed reaction , sulfur dioxide , chlorine and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides
nucleophilic abstraction can be used to separate an alkane from a metal
alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by transmetalation reactions
a mixture of antimony pentafluoride ( sbf5 ) and fluorosulfonic acid ( hso3f ) , called magic acid , can protonate alkanes
alkanes form a small portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets such as jupiter ( 0 methane , 2ppm ethane ) , saturn ( 0 methane , 5ppm ethane ) , uranus ( 1 methane , 2ppm ethane ) and neptune ( 1 methane , 1ppm ethane )
titan ( 1 methane ) , a satellite of saturn , was examined by the huygens probe , which indicated that titans atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moons surface
alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites
traces of methane gas ( about 0 or 1745ppb ) occur in the earths atmosphere , produced primarily by methanogenic microorganisms , such as archaea in the gut of ruminants
the most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and oil
natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane , with some propane and butane oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons
these hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants ( zooplankton and phytoplankton ) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form
natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction
these hydrocarbon deposits , collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks , comprise commercial oil fields
they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced
the depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisis
methane is also present in what is called biogas , produced by animals and decaying matter , which is a possible renewable energy source
alkanes have a low solubility in water , so the content in the oceans is negligible ; however , at high pressures and low temperatures ( such as at the bottom of the oceans ) , methane can co - crystallize with water to form a solid methane clathrate ( methane hydrate )
although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time , the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together
methane extracted from methane clathrate is , therefore , a candidate for future fuels
certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes they prefer even - numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd - numbered chains
on the other hand , certain archaea , the methanogens , produce large quantities of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidized organic compounds
the energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen
methanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands
the methane output of cattle and other herbivores , which can release 30 to 50 gallons per day , is also due to methanogens
they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans
methanogenic archaea are , hence , at the end of the carbon cycle , with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis
it is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way
alkanes also play a role , if a minor role , in the biology of the three eukaryotic groups of organisms fungi , plants and animals
some specialized yeasts , for example , candida tropicale , pichia sp
, can use alkanes as a source of carbon or energy
the fungus amorphotheca resinae prefers the longer - chain alkanes in aviation fuel , and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions
in plants , the solid long - chain alkanes are found in the plant cuticle and epicuticular wax of many species , but are only rarely major constituents

they protect the plant against water loss , prevent the leaching of important minerals by the rain , and protect against bacteria , fungi , and harmful insects
the carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd - numbered , between 27 and 33 carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by decarboxylation of even - numbered fatty acids
the exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species - dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions , temperature or humidity
more volatile short - chain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues
the jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of n - heptane in its resin , for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating
floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components , and n - nonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses
edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers , mainly 8 to 35 , usually peaking in the low to upper 20s , with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram ( parts per million by weight ) and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction

alkanes are found in animal products , although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons
one example is the shark liver oil , which is approximately 14 pristane ( 2 , 6 , 10 , 14 - tetramethylpentadecane , c19h40 )
they are important as pheromones , chemical messenger materials , on which insects depend for communication
in some species , for example the support beetle xylotrechus colonus , pentacosane ( c25h52 ) , 3 - methylpentaicosane ( c26h54 ) and 9 - methylpentaicosane ( c26h54 ) are transferred by body contact
with others like the tsetse fly glossina morsitans morsitans , the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2 - methylheptadecane ( c18h38 ) , 17 , 21 - dimethylheptatriacontane ( c39h80 ) , 15 , 19 - dimethylheptatriacontane ( c39h80 ) and 15 , 19 , 23 - trimethylheptatriacontane ( c40h82 ) , and acts by smell over longer distances
waggle - dancing honey bees produce and release two alkanes , tricosane and pentacosane
one example , in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role , is the ecological relationship between the sand bee ( andrena nigroaenea ) and the early spider orchid ( ophrys sphegodes ) ; the latter is dependent for pollination on the former
sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate ; in the case of nigroaenea , the females emit a mixture of tricosane ( c23h48 ) , pentacosane ( c25h52 ) and heptacosane ( c27h56 ) in the ratio 331 , and males are attracted by specifically this odor
the orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen ; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees
as a result , numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee , it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen ,
as stated earlier , the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and crude oil
alkanes are separated in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many products
the fischer–tropsch process is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons , including alkanes , from carbon monoxide and hydrogen
this method is used to produce substitutes for petroleum distillates
there is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory , since they are usually commercially available
also , alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically , and do not undergo functional group interconversions cleanly
when alkanes are produced in the laboratory , it is often a side - product of a reaction
for example , the use of n - butyllithium as a strong base gives the conjugate acid , n - butane as a side - product
however , at times it may be desirable to make a section of a molecule into an alkane - like functionality ( alkyl group ) using the above or similar methods
for example , an ethyl group is an alkyl group ; when this is attached to a hydroxy group , it gives ethanol , which is not an alkane
to do so , the best - known methods are hydrogenation of alkenes
alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from alkyl halides in the corey–house–posner–whitesides reaction
the barton–mccombie deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols for example
and the clemmensen reduction removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or alkyl - substituted compounds for example
alkanes can be prepared from a variety of organic compounds
these include alkenes , alkynes , haloalkanes , alcohols , aldehydes , ketones and carboxylic acids
addition of molecular hydrogen across the π bond ( s ) of alkenes and alkynes give alkanes
this hydrogenation reaction is typically performed using a powdered metal catalyst , such as palladium , platinum , or nickel
the reaction is exothermic because the product alkane is more stable
this is an important process in several fields of industrial and research chemistry
in the wurtz reaction , a haloalkane is treated with sodium in dry ether to yield an alkane having double the number of carbon atoms this reaction proceeds through a free radical intermediate and has the possibility of alkene formation in case of tertiary haloalkanes and vicinal dihalides
in corey–house synthesis , a haloalkane is treated with dialkyl lithium cuprate , a gilman reagent , to yield a higher alkane
haloalkanes can be reduced to alkanes by reaction with hydride reagents such as lithium aluminium hydride
the applications of alkanes depend on the number of carbon atoms the first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes , and in some countries for electricity generation
methane and ethane are the main components of natural gas ; they are normally stored as gases under pressure
it is , however , easier to transport them as liquids this requires both compression and cooling of the gas
propane and butane are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as liquified petroleum gas ( lpg )
propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles , butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters
both are used as propellants in aerosol sprays
from pentane to octane the alkanes are highly volatile liquids
they are used as fuels in internal combustion engines , as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets , which would impair the uniformity of the combustion
branched - chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition , which causes knocking , than their straight - chain homologues
this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of the fuel , where 2 , 2 , 4 - trimethylpentane ( isooctane ) has an arbitrary value of 100 , and heptane has a value of zero
apart from their use as fuels , the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances
alkanes from nonane to , for instance , hexadecane ( an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms ) are liquids of higher viscosity , less and less suitable for use in gasoline
they form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel
diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number , cetane being an old name for hexadecane
however , the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions , where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly
alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil
in the latter function , they work at the same time as anti - corrosive agents , as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface
many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax , for example , in candles
this should not be confused however with true wax , which consists primarily of esters
alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen , used , for example , in road surfacing
however , the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking
some synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene are alkanes with chains containing hundreds or thousands of carbon atoms these materials are used in innumerable applications , and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year
alkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds
this inertness yields serious ecological issues if they are released into the environment
due to their lack of functional groups and low water solubility , alkanes show poor bioavailability for microorganisms
there are , however , some microorganisms possessing the metabolic capacity to utilize n - alkanes as both carbon and energy sources
methane is flammable , explosive and dangerous to inhale ; because it is a colorless , odorless gas , special caution must be taken around methane
both of them may cause suffocation
propane , too , is flammable and explosive ,
alkanes also pose a threat to the environment
branched alkanes have a lower biodegradability than unbranched alkanes
although the amount of methane in the atmosphere is relatively low
united states appellate procedure involves the rules and regulations for filing appeals in state courts and federal courts
the nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted
there are many types of standard of review for appeals , such as de novo and abuse of discretion
however , most appeals begin when a party files a petition for review to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower courts decision
an appellate court is a court that hears cases on appeal from another court
depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance , a party to a court case who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds
these grounds typically could include errors of law , fact , procedure or due process
in different jurisdictions , appellate courts are also called appeals courts , courts of appeals , superior courts , or supreme courts
the specific procedures for appealing , including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision , can vary greatly from state to state
the right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state ; for example , the new jersey constitution vests judicial power in a supreme court , a superior court , and other courts of limited jurisdiction , with an appellate court being part of the superior court
a party who files an appeal is called an appellant , plaintiff in error , petitioner or pursuer , and a party on the other side is called an appellee
a cross - appeal is an appeal brought by the respondent
for example , suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay 50 , 000
if the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money , then the plaintiff might file a cross - appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay 200 , 000 instead of 50 , 000
the appellant is the party who , having lost part or all their claim in a lower court decision , is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered
this is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law , but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct , or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence
the appellant in the new case can be either the plaintiff ( or claimant ) , defendant , third - party intervenor , or respondent ( appellee ) from the lower case , depending on who was the losing party
the winning party from the lower court , however , is now the respondent
in unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below , but still appeal
an appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court judgment was in its favor
the appellee is required to respond to the petition , oral arguments , and legal briefs of the appellant
in general , the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower courts decision should be affirmed
an appeal as of right is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle
the appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal
an appeal by leave or permission requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal ; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellants demand to appeal the lower courts decision
in the supreme court , review in most cases is available only if the court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari
in tort , equity , or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal
in criminal matters , however , the state or prosecution generally has no appeal as of right
and due to the double jeopardy principle , the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal
but in some jurisdictions , the state or prosecution may appeal as of right from a trial courts dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial courts granting of a defendants suppression motion
likewise , in some jurisdictions , the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law by leave from the trial court or the appellate court
the ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally
all parties must present grounds to appeal , or it will not be heard
by convention in some law reports , the appellant is named first
this can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals , the name of the case in the law reports reverses ( in some cases twice ) as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy
this is not always true , however
in the federal courts , the parties names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the circuit courts of appeals , and are re - ordered only if the appeal reaches the supreme court
many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals , particularly in the criminal context
the first is the traditional direct appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review
the second is the collateral appeal or post - conviction petition , in which the petitioner - appellant files the appeal in a court of first instance—usually the court that tried the case
the key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts , and the latter in federal courts
relief in post - conviction is rare and is most often found in capital or violent felony cases
the typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating dna evidence demonstrating the defendants actual innocence
appellate review is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate jurisdiction take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts
it is distinguished from judicial review , which refers to the courts overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons ( which may vary by jurisdiction )
in most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final judgment
generally , an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case
this is because such orders cannot be appealed as of right
however , certain critical interlocutory court orders , such as the denial of a request for an interim injunction , or an order holding a person in contempt of court , can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of
there are two distinct forms of appellate review , direct and collateral
for example , a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court , and lose on direct appeal to higher state appellate courts , and if unsuccessful , mount a collateral action such as filing for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts
generally speaking , direct appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact
collateral review , on the other hand , provides an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence , and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional , jurisdictional , or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial

in anglo - american common law courts , appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by prerogative writ in certain cases
there is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental civil law legal systems , though some mixed systems such as quebec recognize these prerogative writs
after exhausting the first appeal as of right , defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision
this appeal is known as a direct appeal
the highest state court , generally known as the supreme court , exercises discretion over whether it will review the case
on direct appeal , a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process
an appellants claim ( s ) must usually be preserved at trial
this means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial
because constitutional claims are of great magnitude , appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved
for example , connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims 1
the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error ; 2
the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right ; 3
the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial ; 4
if subject to harmless error analysis , the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt
all states have a post - conviction relief process
similar to federal post - conviction relief , an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review
after direct appeal , the conviction is considered final
an appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal
that is , it goes to the intermediate appellate court , followed by the highest court
if the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration , the sentence could be modified , or a new trial could be ordered
a notice of appeal is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal
the form is completed by the appellant or by the appellants legal representative
the nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country
the specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun
for example , the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court , or with the court from which the appeal is taken , or both
some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the courts own web site
in new jersey , for example , the administrative office of the court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants , though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used
the deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short traditionally , it is measured in days , not months
this can vary from country to country , as well as within a country , depending on the specific rules in force
in the federal court system , criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed , or the right to appeal is forfeited
generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not
the appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower courts findings of fact ( such as whether a defendant committed a particular act ) , unless clearly erroneous , and so will focus on the courts application of the law to those facts ( such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue )
if the appellate court finds no defect , it affirms the judgment
if the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision below ( that is , in the lower court ) , it may modify the ruling to correct the defect , or it may nullify ( reverse or vacate ) the whole decision or any part of it
it may , in addition , send the case back ( remand or remit ) to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect
in some cases , an appellate court may review a lower court decision de novo ( or completely ) , challenging even the lower courts findings of fact
this might be the proper standard of review , for example , if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre - trial motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony
another situation is where appeal is by way of re - hearing
certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court
sometimes , the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits , which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below
( this would happen , for example , if the appellant waited too long , under the appellate courts rules , to file the appeal
generally , there is no trial in an appellate court , only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre - trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed—unless the appeal is by way of re - hearing , new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in very rare instances , for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as prosecutorial misconduct
in some systems , an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court , together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal
in other systems , the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court
in those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court
the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee ( or respondent ) can present arguments against it
arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers , if represented , or pro se if the party has not engaged legal representation
those arguments are presented in written briefs and sometimes in oral argument to the court at a hearing
at such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs
in an adversarial system , appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it
therefore , if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner , or against legal precedent , that judgment will stand if not appealed – even if it might have been overturned on appeal
the united states legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals a trial de novo or an appeal on the record
a trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial trial
if unchallenged , these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all
if a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal , one generally has the power to request a trial de novo by a court of record
in such a proceeding , all issues and evidence may be developed newly , as though never heard before , and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding
sometimes , however , the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence , thus helping to curb frivolous appeals
in some cases , an application for trial de novo effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place
the supreme court of virginia has stated that this court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial
the only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses , where they are convicted on a lesser offense , the appeal is of the lesser offense ; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses
a trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles ,
subject only to the limitation that conviction in the district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense ,
in an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding , both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal
each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result
precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments
in order for the appeal to succeed , the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error , that is , an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust , and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly
some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case , permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney , admitting or excluding evidence improperly , acting outside the courts jurisdiction , injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so , juror misconduct , etcetera the failure to formally object at the time , to what one views as improper action in the lower court , may result in the affirmance of the lower courts judgment on the grounds that one did not preserve the issue for appeal by objecting
in cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact , an appellate court will apply an abuse of discretion standard of review
under this standard , the appellate court gives deference to the lower courts view of the evidence , and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion
this is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness
on the other hand , the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower courts decision on issues of law , and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard
in some cases , an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid , or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered
in the case of new evidence , there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial
another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel
if a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation , he is entitled to a new trial
a lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words may it please the court
after an appeal is heard , the mandate is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal ; this notice is transmitted to the trial court and , when filed by the clerk of the trial court , constitutes the final judgment on the case , unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court
the mandate is distinguished from the appeal courts opinion , which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision
in some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the remittitur
affirmed where the reviewing court basically agrees with the result of the lower courts ruling ( s )
reversed where the reviewing court basically disagrees with the result of the lower courts ruling ( s ) , and overturns their decision
vacated where the reviewing court overturns the lower courts ruling ( s ) as invalid , without necessarily disagreeing with it / them , for example because the case was decided on the basis of a legal principle that no longer applies
there can be multiple outcomes , so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings , reverse others and remand the case all at the same time
remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case
generally speaking , an appellate courts judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed , setting out with specificity the courts determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed , reversed , remanded or modified
some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than review improvidently granted
in other words , after looking at the case , they chose not to say anything
the result for the case of review improvidently granted is effectively the same as affirmed , but without that extra higher court stamp of approval
in law , an answer was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something , and thus generally any counter - statement or defense , a reply to a question or response , or objection , or a correct solution of a problem
in the common law , an answer is the first pleading by a defendant , usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant
it may have been preceded by an optional pre - answer motion to dismiss or demurrer ; if such a motion is unsuccessful , the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment
in a criminal case , there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court
the pleading in the criminal case , which is entered on the record in open court , is usually either guilty or not guilty
generally speaking in private , civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence
there is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of equitable remedy such as restitution or a permanent injunction
criminal cases may lead to fines or other punishment , such as imprisonment
the famous latin responsa prudentium ( answers of the learned ones ) were the accumulated views of many successive generations of roman lawyers , a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative
during debates of a contentious nature , deflection , colloquially known as changing the topic , has been widely observed , and is often seen as a failure to answer a question
an appellate court , commonly called a court of appeal ( s ) , appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules
under its standard of review , an appellate court decides the extent of the deference it would give to the lower courts decision , based on whether the appeal were one of fact or of law
in reviewing an issue of fact , an appellate court ordinarily gives deference to the trial courts findings
it is the duty of trial judges or juries to find facts , view the evidence firsthand , and observe witness testimony
when reviewing lower decisions on an issue of fact , courts of appeal generally look for clear error
the appellate court reviews issues of law de novo ( anew , no deference ) and may reverse or modify the lower courts decision if the appellate court believes the lower court misapplied the facts or the law
an appellate court may also review the lower judges discretionary decisions , such as whether the judge properly granted a new trial or disallowed evidence
the lower courts decision is only changed in cases of an abuse of discretion
this standard tends to be even more deferential than the clear error standard
before hearing any case , the court must have jurisdiction to consider the appeal
the authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another
in some areas , the appellate court has limited powers of review
generally , an appellate courts judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed , setting out with specificity the courts determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed , reversed , remanded or modified
depending on the type of case and the decision below , appellate review primarily consists of an entirely new hearing ( a non trial de novo ) ; a hearing where the appellate court gives deference to factual findings of the lower court ; or review of particular legal rulings made by the lower court ( an appeal on the record )
while many appellate courts have jurisdiction over all cases decided by lower courts , some systems have appellate courts divided by the type of jurisdiction they exercise
some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts , such as the texas court of criminal appeals , which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases , and the court of appeals for the federal circuit , which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases , on one hand , and appeals from the court of federal claims on the other
in the united states , alabama , tennessee , and oklahoma also have separate courts of criminal appeals
texas and oklahoma have the final determination of criminal cases vested in their respective courts of criminal appeals ,
the court of appeal of new zealand , located in wellington , is new zealands principal intermediate appellate court
the court of appeals of the philippines is the principal intermediate appellate court of that country
the court of appeals is primarily found in manila , with three divisions each in cebu city and cagayan de oro
other appellate courts include the sandiganbayan for cases involving graft and corruption , and the court of tax appeals for cases involving tax
appeals from all three appellate courts are to the supreme court
the court of appeal of sri lanka , located in colombo , is the second senior court in the sri lankan legal system
in the united states , both state and federal appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations , rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were
in most states , and in federal courts , parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right
this means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome
however , appeals may be costly , and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict
therefore , only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals
some appellate courts , particularly supreme courts , have the power of discretionary review , meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case
many jurisdictions title their appellate court a court of appeal or court of appeals
historically , others have titled their appellate court a court of errors ( or court of errors and appeals ) , on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts
examples of such courts include the new jersey court of errors and appeals ( which existed from 1844 to 1947 ) , the connecticut supreme court of errors ( which has been renamed the connecticut supreme court ) , the kentucky court of errors ( renamed the kentucky supreme court ) , and the mississippi high court of errors and appeals ( since renamed the supreme court of mississippi )
in some jurisdictions , a court able to hear appeals is known as an appellate division
the phrase court of appeals most often refers to intermediate appellate courts
however , the maryland and new york systems are different
the maryland court of appeals and the new york court of appeals are the highest appellate courts in those states
the new york supreme court is a trial court of general jurisdiction
depending on the system , certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts , hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction
arraignment is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the defendant , to inform them of the charges against them
in response to arraignment , the accused is expected to enter a plea
acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions , but they generally include guilty , not guilty , and the peremptory pleas , or pleas in bar , setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed
pleas of nolo contendere ( no contest ) and the alford plea are allowed in some circumstances
in australia , arraignment is the first of 11 stages in a criminal trial , and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment
the judge will testify during the indictment process
in every province in canada , except british columbia , defendants are arraigned on the day of their trial
in british columbia , arraignment takes place in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer
the defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge
in france , the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than 24 hours from the time of the arrest
however , police custody can last another 24 hours in specific circumstances , especially if the offence is punishable by at least one years imprisonment , or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time , and can last up to 96 hours in certain cases involving terrorism , drug trafficking or organised crime
the police need to have the consent of the prosecutor , the procureur
in the vast majority of cases , the prosecutor will consent
in germany , if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police one must be brought before a judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest
in new zealand law , at the first appearance of the accused , they are read the charges and asked for a plea
the available pleas are guilty , not guilty , and no plea
no plea allows the defendant to get legal advice on the plea , which must be made on the second appearance
in south africa , arraignment is defined as the calling upon the accused to appear , the informing of the accused of the crime charged against them , the demanding of the accused whether they plead guilty or not guilty , and the entering of their plea
their plea having been entered , they are said to stand arraigned
in england , wales , and northern ireland , arraignment is the first of 11 stages in a criminal trial , and involves the clerk of the court reading out the indictment
in england and wales , the police cannot legally detain anyone for more than 24 hours without charging them unless an officer with the rank of superintendent ( or above ) authorises detention for a further 12 hours ( 36 hours total ) , or a judge ( who will be a magistrate ) authorises detention by the police before charge for up to a maximum of 96 hours , but for terrorism - related offences people can be held by the police for up to 28 days before charge
if they are not released after being charged , they should be brought before a court as soon as practicable
under the united states federal rules of criminal procedure , arraignment shall consist of an open reading of the indictment to the defendant and call on them to plead thereto
they shall be given a copy of the indictment before they are called upon to plead
in federal courts , arraignment takes place in two stages
the first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within 48 hours of an individuals arrest , 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until monday
during this stage , the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel
the presiding judge also decides at what amount , if any , to set bail
during the second stage , a post - indictment arraignment ( pia ) , the defendant is allowed to enter a plea
in california , arraignments must be conducted without unnecessary delay and , in any event , within 48 hours of arrest , excluding weekends and holidays
county of riverside v
mclaughlin , 500 44 ( 1991 )
the wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction
however , it generally conforms with the following principles
video arraignment is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of videoconferencing technology
use of video arraignment system allows the court to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the courtroom by using an audio - visual link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom
use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants
the transportation of defendants requires time , puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public , court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention
it also addresses the rising costs of transportation
if the defendant pleads guilty , an evidentiary hearing usually follows
the court is not required to accept a guilty plea
during the hearing , the judge assesses the offense , the mitigating factors , and the defendants character , and passes sentence
in the past , a defendant who refused to plead ( or stood mute ) was subject to peine forte et dure ( law french for strong and hard punishment )
today , in common law jurisdictions , the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea
the rationale for this is the defendants right to silence
this is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre - trial release and bail may be made , depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction
america the beautiful is a patriotic american song
its lyrics were written by katharine lee bates and its music was composed by church organist and choirmaster samuel ward at grace episcopal church in newark , new jersey
the two never met
bates wrote the words as a poem originally entitled pikes peak
it was first published in the fourth of july 1895 edition of the church periodical , the congregationalist
it was at that time that the poem was first entitled america
ward had initially composed the songs melody in 1882 to accompany lyrics to materna , basis of the hymn , o mother dear , jerusalem , though the hymn was not first published until 1892
in 1893 , at the age of 33 , bates , an english professor at wellesley college , had taken a train trip to colorado springs , colorado , to teach at colorado college
the wheat fields of americas heartland kansas , through which her train was riding on july 16 ; and the majestic view of the great plains from high atop pikes peak
on the pinnacle of that mountain , the words of the poem started to come to her , and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original antlers hotel
the poem was initially published two years later in the congregationalist to commemorate the fourth of july
it quickly caught the publics fancy
an amended version was published in 1904
listentypemusicfilenameamerica the beautiful , performed by the united states navy band
ogatitleamerica the beautifuldescriptionamerica the beautiful , as performed by the united states navy band
the first known melody written for the song was sent in by silas pratt when the poem was published in the congregationalist
by 1900 , at least 75 different melodies had been written
a hymn tune composed in 1882 by samuel ward , the organist and choir director at grace church , newark , was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today
just as bates had been inspired to write her poem , ward , too , was inspired
the tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from coney island back to his home in new york city after a leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down
he composed the tune for the old hymn o mother dear , jerusalem , retitling the work materna
wards music combined with batess poem were first published together in 1910 and titled america the beautiful
cite book
ward died in 1903 , not knowing the national stature his music would attain
bates was more fortunate , since the songs popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929
it is included in songbooks in many religious congregations in the united states
at various times in the more than one hundred years that have elapsed since the song was written , particularly during the john kennedy administration , there have been efforts to give america the beautiful legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to , or in place of , the star - spangled banner , but so far this has not succeeded
proponents prefer america the beautiful for various reasons , saying it is easier to sing , more melodic , and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as the star - spangled banner
some prefer america the beautiful over the star - spangled banner due to the latters war - oriented imagery ; others prefer the star - spangled banner for the same reason
while that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem , america the beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of americans , and was even being considered before 1931 as a candidate to become the national anthem of the united states
frank sinatra recorded the song with nelson riddle during the sessions for the concert sinatra in february 1963 , for a projected 45 single release
the 45 was not commercially issued however , but the song was later added as a bonus track to the enhanced 2012 cd release of the concert sinatra
in 1976 , while the united states celebrated its bicentennial , a soulful version popularized by ray charles peaked at number 98 on the us rb chart
his version was traditionally played on new years eve in times square following the ball drop
three different renditions of the song have entered the hot country songs charts
the first was by charlie rich , which went to number 22 in 1976
an all - star version of america the beautiful performed by country singers trace adkins , sherrié austin , billy dean , vince gill , carolyn dawn johnson , toby keith , brenda lee , lonestar , lyle lovett , lila mccann , lorrie morgan , jamie oneal , the oak ridge boys , collin raye , kenny rogers , keith urban and phil vassar reached number 58 in july 2001
the song re - entered the chart following the september 11 attacks
popularity of the song increased greatly following the september 11 attacks ; at some sporting events it was sung in addition to the traditional singing of the national anthem
during the first taping of the late show with david letterman following the attacks , cbs newsman dan rather cried briefly as he quoted the fourth verse
for super bowl xlviii , the coca - cola company aired a multilingual version of the song , sung in several different languages
the commercial received some criticism on social media sites , such as twitter and facebook , and from some conservatives , such as glenn beck
on january 20 , 2017 , jackie evancho released together we stand , a disc containing three patriotic songs including america the beautiful
an abbreviated cover with the 1911 lyrics was performed by greg jong for the soundtrack of the 2020 video game wasteland 3 , and is played during the final hostile encounters in the denver section
jennifer lopez performed the song at president joe bidens inauguration on january 20 , 2021 as the second half of a medley with this land is your land by woody guthrie
from sea to shining sea , originally used in the charters of some of the english colonies in north america , is an american idiom meaning from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean ( or vice versa )
other songs that have used this phrase include the american patriotic song god bless the and schoolhouse rocks elbow room
the phrase and the song are also the namesake of the shining sea bikeway , a bike path in batess hometown of falmouth , massachusetts
the phrase is similar to the latin phrase
purple mountain majesties refers to the shade of the pikes peak in colorado springs , colorado , which inspired bates to write the poem
in 2003 , tori amos appropriated the phrase for amber waves of grain to create a personification for her song amber waves
amos imagines amber waves as an exotic dancer , like the character of the same name portrayed by julianne moore in boogie nights
lynn sherrs 2001 book america the beautiful discusses the origins of the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth
the book points out that the poem has the same meter as that of auld lang syne ; the songs can be sung interchangeably
additionally , sherr discusses the evolution of the lyrics , for instance , changes to the original third verse written by bates
melinda ponder , in her 2017 biography katharine lee bates from sea to shining sea , draws heavily on batess diaries and letters to trace the history of the poem and its place in american culture
assistive technology ( at ) is a term for assistive , adaptive , and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities and the elderly
disabled people often have difficulty performing activities of daily living ( adls ) independently , or even with assistance
adls are self - care activities that include toileting , mobility ( ambulation ) , eating , bathing , dressing , grooming , and personal device care
assistive technology can ameliorate the effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform adls
assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks they were formerly unable to accomplish , or had great difficulty accomplishing , by providing enhancements to , or changing methods of interacting with , the technology needed to accomplish such tasks
for example , wheelchairs provide independent mobility for those who cannot walk , while assistive eating devices can enable people who cannot feed themselves to do so
due to assistive technology , disabled people have an opportunity of a more positive and easygoing lifestyle , with an increase in social participation , security and control , and a greater chance to reduce institutional costs without significantly increasing household expenses
in schools , assistive technology can be critical in allowing students with disabilities access the general education curriculum
students who experience challenges writing or keyboarding , for example , can use voice recognition software instead
adaptive technology and assistive technology are different
assistive technology is something that is used to help disabled people , while adaptive technology covers items that are specifically designed for disabled people and would seldom be used by a non - disabled person
in other words , assistive technology is any object or system that helps people with disabilities , while adaptive technology is specifically designed for disabled people
occupational therapy ( ot ) is a healthcare profession that specializes in maintaining or improving the quality of life for individuals that experience challenges when independently performing lifes occupations
according to the occupational therapy practice framework domain and process ( 3rd ed
; aota , 2014 ) , occupations include areas related to all basic and instrumental activities of daily living ( adls ) , rest and sleep , education , work , play , leisure and social participation
occupational therapists have the specialized skill of employing assistive technology ( at ) in the improvement and maintenance of optimal , functional participation in occupations
the application of at enables an individual to adapt aspects of the environment , that may otherwise be challenging , to the user in order to optimize functional participation in those occupations
as a result , occupational therapists may educate , recommend , and promote the use of at to improve the quality of life for their clients
wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled , and that include a seating system and are designed to be a substitute for the normal mobility that most people have
wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility - related activities of daily living which include feeding , toileting , dressing , grooming , and bathing
the devices come in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick , sip - and - puff control , head switches or other input devices
often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers
wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness , injury , or disability
people with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker
newer advancements in wheelchair design enable wheelchairs to climb stairs , go off - road or propel using segway technology or additional add - ons like handbikes or power assists
patient transfer devices generally allow patients with impaired mobility to be moved by caregivers between beds , wheelchairs , commodes , toilets , chairs , stretchers , shower benches , automobiles , swimming pools , and other patient support systems ( that is , radiology , surgical , or examining tables )
the most common devices are transfer benches , stretcher or convertible chairs ( for lateral , supine transfer ) , sit - to - stand lifts ( for moving patients from one seated position to another that is , from wheelchairs to commodes ) , air bearing inflatable mattresses ( for supine transfer that is , transfer from a gurney to an operating room table ) , gait belts ( or transfer belt ) and a slider board ( or transfer board ) , usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair or from a bed to an operating table
highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a patient lift ( a floor or ceiling - suspended sling lift ) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state - of - the - art transfer device by osha and the american nursing association
a walker or walking frame or rollator is a tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking
it consists of a frame that is about waist high , approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user
walkers are also available in other sizes , such as for children , or for heavy people
modern walkers are height - adjustable
the front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it
it is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front
a prosthesis , prosthetic , or prosthetic limb is a device that replaces a missing body part
it is part of the field of biomechatronics , the science of using mechanical devices with human muscular , musculoskeletal , and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by trauma , disease , or defect
prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury ( traumatic ) or missing from birth ( congenital ) or to supplement defective body parts
inside the body , artificial heart valves are in common use with artificial hearts and lungs seeing less common use but under active technology development
other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include hearing aids , artificial eyes , palatal obturator , gastric bands , and dentures
prostheses are specifically not orthoses , although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis
prostheses are technically the complete finished item
for instance , a c - leg knee alone is not a prosthesis , but only a prosthetic component
the complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system to the residual limb — usually a socket , and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device
despite the technical difference , the terms are often used interchangeably
the terms prosthetic and orthotic are adjectives used to describe devices such as a prosthetic knee
the terms prosthetics and orthotics are used to describe the respective allied health fields
an occupational therapists role in prosthetics include therapy , training and evaluations
prosthetic training includes orientation to prosthetics components and terminology , donning and doffing , wearing schedule , and how to care for residual limb and the prosthesis
a powered exoskeleton is a wearable mobile machine that is powered by a system of electric motors , pneumatics , levers , hydraulics , or a combination of technologies that allow for limb movement with increased strength and endurance
its design aims to provide back support , sense the users motion , and send a signal to motors which manage the gears
the exoskeleton supports the shoulder , waist and thigh , and assists movement for lifting and holding heavy items , while lowering back stress
people with balance and motor function challenges often need specialized equipment to sit or stand safely and securely
positioning is often important in seating arrangements to ensure that users body pressure is distributed equally without inhibiting movement in a desired way
positioning devices have been developed to aid in allowing people to stand and bear weight on their legs without risk of a fall
these standers are generally grouped into two categories based on the position of the occupant
prone standers distribute the body weight to the front of the individual and usually have a tray in front of them
this makes them good for users who are actively trying to carry out some task
supine standers distribute the body weight to the back and are good for cases where the user has more limited mobility or is recovering from injury
many people with serious visual impairments live independently , using a wide range of tools and techniques
examples of assistive technology for visually impairment include screen readers , screen magnifiers , braille embossers , desktop video magnifiers , and voice recorders
screen readers are used to help the visually impaired to easily access electronic information
these software programs run on a computer in order to convey the displayed information through voice ( text - to - speech ) or braille ( refreshable braille displays ) in combination with magnification for low vision users in some cases
there are a variety of platforms and applications available for a variety of costs with differing feature sets
some example of screen readers are apple voiceover , google talkback and microsoft narrator
this software is provided free of charge on all apple devices
apple voiceover includes the option to magnify the screen , control the keyboard , and provide verbal descriptions to describe what is happening on the screen
there are thirty languages to select from
it also has the capacity to read aloud file content , as well as web pages , e - mail messages , and word processing files
as mentioned above , screen readers may rely on the assistance of text - to - speech tools
to use the text - to - speech tools , the documents must in an electronic form , that is uploaded as the digital format
however , people usually will use the hard copy documents scanned into the computer , which cannot be recognized by the text - to - speech software
to solve this issue , people always use optical character recognition technology accompanied with text - to - speech software
braille is a system of raised dots formed into units called braille cells
a full braille cell is made up of six dots , with two parallel rows of three dots , but other combinations and quantities of dots represent other letters , numbers , punctuation marks , or words
people can then use their fingers to read the code of raised dots
a braille embosser is , simply put , a printer for braille
instead of a standard printer adding ink onto a page , the braille embosser imprints the raised dots of braille onto a page
some braille embossers combine both braille and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch
a refreshable braille display or braille terminal is an electro - mechanical device for displaying braille characters , usually by means of round - tipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface
computer users who cannot use a computer monitor use it to read a braille output version of the displayed text
desktop video magnifiers are electronic devices that use a camera and a display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials
they enlarge printed pages for those with low vision
a camera connects to a monitor that displays real - time images , and the user can control settings such as magnification , focus , contrast , underlining , highlighting , and other screen preferences
they come in a variety of sizes and styles ; some are small and portable with handheld cameras , while others are much larger and mounted on a fixed stand
a screen magnifier is software that interfaces with a computers graphical output to present enlarged screen content
it allows users to enlarge the texts and graphics on their computer screens for easier viewing
similar to desktop video magnifiers , this technology assists people with low vision
after the user loads the software into their computers memory , it serves as a kind of computer magnifying glass
wherever the computer cursor moves , it enlarges the area around it
this allows greater computer accessibility for a wide range of visual abilities
a large - print keyboard has large letters printed on the keys
on the keyboard shown , the round buttons at the top control software which can magnify the screen ( zoom in ) , change the background color of the screen , or make the mouse cursor on the screen larger
the bump dots on the keys , installed in this case by the organization using the keyboards , help the user find the right keys in a tactile way
assistive technology for navigation has exploded on the ieee xplore database since 2000 , , and the number of articles in this area is increasing every year
gps , accelerometers , gyroscopes , and cameras can pinpoint the exact location of the user and provide information on what is in the immediate vicinity , and assistance in getting to a destination
wearable technology are smart electronic devices that can be worn on the body as an implant or an accessory
new technologies are exploring how the visually impaired can receive visual information through wearable devices
personal emergency response systems ( pers ) , or telecare ( uk term ) , are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer
an example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors , thermometers ( for hypothermia risk ) , flooding and unlit gas sensors ( for people with mild dementia )
notably , these alerts can be customized to the particular persons risks
when the alert is triggered , a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately
in human–computer interaction , computer accessibility ( also known as accessible computing ) refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people , regardless of disability or severity of impairment , examples include web accessibility guidelines
this development of this standard has been supported in europe by snapi and has been successfully incorporated into the lasseo specifications , but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers
people in the d / deaf and hard of hearing community have a more difficult time receiving auditory information as compared to hearing individuals
these individuals often rely on visual and tactile mediums for receiving and communicating information
the use of assistive technology and devices provides this community with various solutions to auditory communication needs by providing higher sound ( for those who are hard of hearing ) , tactile feedback , visual cues and improved technology access
individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing utilize a variety of assistive technologies that provide them with different access to information in numerous environments
most devices either provide amplified sound or alternate ways to access information through vision and / or vibration
these technologies can be grouped into three general categories hearing technology , alerting devices , and communication support
a hearing aid or deaf aid is an electro - acoustic device which is designed to amplify sound for the wearer , usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible , and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry
this type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their hearing communities by allowing them to hear more clearly
they amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone , amplifier , and speaker
there is a wide variety of hearing aids available , including digital , in - the - ear , in - the - canal , behind - the - ear , and on - the - body aids
assistive listening devices include fm , infrared , and loop assistive listening devices
this type of technology allows people with hearing difficulties to focus on a speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background noises and distractions , making places like auditoriums , classrooms , and meetings much easier to participate in
the assistive listening device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it wirelessly over an fm ( frequency modulation ) transmission , ir ( infra red ) transmission , il ( induction loop ) transmission , or other transmission methods
the person who is listening may use an fm / ir / il receiver to tune into the signal and listen at his / her preferred volume
this type of assistive technology allows users to amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls so that they can easily partake in this medium of communication
there are also options to adjust the frequency and tone of a call to suit their individual hearing needs
additionally , there is a wide variety of amplified telephones to choose from , with different degrees of amplification
for example , a phone with 26 to 40 decibel is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss , while a phone with 71 to 90 decibel is better for more severe hearing loss
augmentative and alternative communication ( aac ) is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language
asha ( 2005 )
aac systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user
they may be as basic as pictures on a board that are used to request food , drink , or other care ; or they can be advanced speech generating devices , based on speech synthesis , that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words

assistive technology for cognition ( atc ) is the use of technology ( usually high tech ) to augment and assist cognitive processes such as attention , memory , self - regulation , navigation , emotion recognition and management , planning , and sequencing activity
systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of atc are growing rapidly , but have focused on memory and planning , that there is emerging evidence for efficacy , that a lot of scope exists to develop new atc
examples of atc include neuropage which prompts users about meetings , wakamaru , which provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and calls for help if something is wrong , and telephone reassurance systems
memory aids are any type of assistive technology that helps a user learn and remember certain information
many memory aids are used for cognitive impairments such as reading , writing , or organizational difficulties
for example , a smartpen records handwritten notes by creating both a digital copy and an audio recording of the text
users simply tap certain parts of their notes , the pen saves it , and reads it back to them
from there , the user can also download their notes onto a computer for increased accessibility
digital voice recorders are also used to record in the moment information for fast and easy recall at a later time
a 2017 cochrane review highlighted the current lack of high - quality evidence to determine whether assistive technology effectively supports people with dementia to manage memory issues
thus , it is not presently sure whether or not assistive technology is beneficial for memory problems
educational software is software that assists people with reading , learning , comprehension , and organizational difficulties
any accommodation software such as text readers , notetakers , text enlargers , organization tools , word predictions , and talking word processors falls under the category of educational software
adaptive eating devices include items commonly used by the general population like spoons and forks and plates
however they become assistive technology when they are modified to accommodate the needs of people who have difficulty using standard cutlery due to a disabling condition
common modifications include increasing the size of the utensil handle to make it easier to grasp
plates and bowls may have a guard on the edge that stops food being pushed off of the dish when it is being scooped
more sophisticated equipment for eating includes manual and powered feeding devices
these devices support those who have little or no hand and arm function and enable them to eat independently
assistive technology in sports is an area of technology design that is growing
assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play
assistive technology may be used in adaptive sports , where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate ; or , assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind
an increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports , leading to the development of new assistive technology
accordingly , assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to the elite paralympic games
more complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time , and as a result , sports for people with disabilities have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition - oriented activity
in the united states there are two major pieces of legislation that govern the use of assistive technology within the school system
the first is section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 and the second being the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) which was first enacted in 1975 under the name the education for all handicapped children act
in 2004 , during the reauthorization period for idea , the national instructional material access center ( nimac ) was created which provided a repository of accessible text including publishers textbooks to students with a qualifying disability
files provided are in xml format and used as a starting platform for braille readers , screen readers , and other digital text software
assistive technology listed is a students iep is not only recommended , it is required ( koch , 2017 )
these devices help students both with and without disabilities access the curriculum in a way they were previously unable to ( koch , 2017 )
occupational therapists play an important role in educating students , parents and teachers about the assistive technology they may interact with ( koch , 2017 )
assistive technology in this area is broken down into low , mid , and high tech categories
low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging
examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading
mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing
high tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software
software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding , word prediction for spelling , and speech to text
supports for reading include the use of text to speech ( tts ) software and font modification via access to digital text
limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using mathml and daisy
one of the largest problems that affect disabled people is discomfort with prostheses
an experiment performed in massachusetts utilized 20 people with various sensors attached to their arms the subjects tried different arm exercises , and the sensors recorded their movements
all of the data helped engineers develop new engineering concepts for prosthetics
assistive technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves such as dvorak and other alternative keyboard layouts , which offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys
assistive technology devices have been created to enable disabled people to use modern touch screen mobile computers such as the ipad , iphone and ipod touch
the pererro is a plug and play adapter for ios devices which uses the built in apple voiceover feature in combination with a basic switch
this brings touch screen technology to those who were previously unable to use it
apple , with the release of ios 7 had introduced the ability to navigate apps using switch control
switch access could be activated either through an external bluetooth connected switch , single touch of the screen , or use of right and left head turns using the devices camera
additional accessibility features include the use of assistive touch which allows a user to access multi - touch gestures through pre - programmed onscreen buttons
for users with physical disabilities a large variety of switches are available and customizable to the users needs varying in size , shape , or amount of pressure required for activation
switch access may be placed near any area of the body which has consistent and reliable mobility and less subject to fatigue
common sites include the hands , head , and feet
eye gaze and head mouse systems can also be used as an alternative mouse navigation
a user may utilize single or multiple switch sites and the process often involves a scanning through items on a screen and activating the switch once the desired object is highlighted
the form of home automation called assistive domotics focuses on making it possible for elderly and disabled people to live independently
home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility
this field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home automation for security , entertainment , and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users
for example , automated prompts and reminders utilize motion sensors and pre - recorded audio messages ; an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off the oven , and one by the front door may remind the resident to lock the door
innovation is happening in assistive technology either through improvements to existing devices or the creation of new products
in the wipo published 2019 report on technology trends , assistive products are grouped into either conventional or emerging technologies
conventional assisting technology tracks innovation within well - established assistive products , whereas emerging assistive technology refers to more advanced products
these identified advanced assistive products are distinguished from the conventional ones by the use of one or more enabling technologies ( for instance , artificial intelligence , internet of things , advanced sensors , new material , additive manufacturing , advanced robotics , augmented and virtual reality ) or by the inclusion of implantable products / components
such emerging assistive products are either more sophisticated or more functional versions of conventional assistive products , or completely novel assistive devices
for instance , in conventional self - care assistive technology , technologies involved typically include adaptive clothing , adaptive eating devices , incontinence products , assistive products for manicure , pedicure , hair and facial care , dental care , or assistive products for sexual activities
in comparison , emerging self - care assistive technologies include health and emotion monitoring , smart diapers , smart medication dispensing and management or feeding assistant robot
although the distinction between conventional and emerging technologies is not always clear - cut , emerging assistive technology tends to be “smarter” , using ai and being more connected and interactive , and including body - integrated solutions or components
to a great extent this « conventional » versus « emerging » classification is based on the whos priority assistive products list standard for assistive products for persons with disabilities , the apl delineating the absolute minimum that countries should be offering to their citizens and iso 9999 defining those products which are already well established in the market
this well - established status is reflected in the patent filings between 2013 and 2017
patent registrations for assistive technologies identified as conventional are nearly eight times larger than the ones for emerging assistive technologies
however , patent filings related to more recent emerging assistive technologies are growing almost three times as fast as those pertaining to conventional ones
patent filings in both conventional and emerging assistive technology are highly concentrated on mobility , hearing and vision
investment in emerging assistive technology also focuses on environment
in the conventional sector , mobility represent 54 of all patents fillings , and is an indication of increased interest in advanced mobility assistive product categories , such as advanced prosthetics , walking aids , wheelchairs , and exoskeletons
in the past , the top patent offices for filing , and therefore perceived target markets , in assistive technology have been the and japan
patenting activity has , however , been declining in these two jurisdictions
at the same time , there has been a surge in patent filings in china and an increase in filings in the republic of korea
this pattern is observed for both conventional and emerging assistive technology , with chinas annual filings surpassing those of the in 2008 for conventional and 2014 for emerging assistive technology
patent filings related to conventional assistive technology have also declined in europe , especially in germany , france , the netherlands and norway
patenting activity indicates the amount of interest and the investment made in respect to an invention’s applicability and its commercialization potential
there is typically a lag between filing a patent application and commercialization , with a product being classified in various stages of readiness levels , research concept , proof of concept , minumum viable product and finally commercial product
according to the 2019 wipo report , the emerging technologies closest to a fully commercial product were for example
the technology readiness level and the related patenting activity can also be explained through the following factors which contribute to a product’s entry to market , such a the expected impact on a person’s participation in different aspects of life , the ease of adoption ( need for training , fitting , additional equipment for interoperability , and so on ) , the societal acceptance and potential ethical concerns , and the need for regulatory approval
this is mainly the case for assistive technology that qualifies as medical technology
among these aspects , acceptability and ethical considerations are particularly relevant to those technologies that are extremely invasive ( such as cortical or auditory brainstem implants ) , or replace the human caregiver and human interaction , or collect and use data on cloud - based services or interconnected devices ( for example , companion robots , smart nursing and health - monitoring technologies ) , raising privacy issues and requiring connectivity , or raise safety concerns , such as autonomous wheelchairs
beyond the patent landscape , industrial designs have an added importance for the field of assistive technology
assistive technology is often not adopted , or else abandoned entirely , because of issues to do with design ( lack of appeal ) or comfort ( poor ergonomics )
design often plays a role after the patenting activity , as a product needs to be re - designed for mass production
overall , assistive technology aims to allow disabled people to participate more fully in all aspects of life ( home , school , and community ) and increases their opportunities for education , social interactions , and potential for meaningful employment
it creates greater independence and control for disabled individuals
for example , in one study of 1 , 342 infants , toddlers and preschoolers , all with some kind of developmental , physical , sensory , or cognitive disability , the use of assistive technology created improvements in child development
additionally , it has been found to lighten caregiver load
there are several platforms that use machine learning to identify the appropriate assistive device to suggest to patients , making assistive devices more accessible
the abacus ( plural abaci or abacuses ) , also called a counting frame , is a calculating tool which has been used since ancient times
it was used in the ancient near east , europe , china , and russia , centuries before the adoption of the hindu - arabic numeral system
the exact origin of the abacus has not yet emerged
it consists of rows of movable beads , or similar objects , strung on a wire
they represent digits
one of the two numbers is set up , and the beads are manipulated to perform an operation such as addition , or even a square or cubic root
in their earliest designs , the rows of beads could be loose on a flat surface or sliding in grooves
later the beads were made to slide on rods and built into a frame , allowing faster manipulation
abacuses are still made , often as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires
in the ancient world , particularly before the introduction of positional notation , abacuses were a practical calculating tool
the abacus is still used to teach the fundamentals of mathematics to some children , for example , in russia
designs such as the japanese soroban have been used for practical calculations of up to multi - digit numbers
any particular abacus design supports multiple methods to perform calculations , including the four basic operations and square and cube roots
some of these methods work with non - natural numbers ( numbers such as )
although calculators and computers are commonly used today instead of abacuses , abacuses remain in everyday use in some countries
merchants , traders , and clerks in some parts of eastern europe , russia , china , and africa use abacuses
the abacus remains in common use
as a scoring system in non - electronic table games
others may use an abacus due to visual impairment that prevents the use of a calculator
the word abacus dates to at least ad 1387 when a middle english work borrowed the word from latin that described a sandboard abacus
the latin word is derived from ancient greek alternatively , without reference to ancient texts on etymology , it has been suggested that it means a square tablet strewn with dust , ( the exact shape of the latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the greek word , probably borrowed from a northwest semitic language like phoenician , evidenced by a cognate with the hebrew word ʾābāq (
the sumerian abacus appeared between 2700–2300 bc
it held a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal ( base 60 ) number system
some scholars point to a character in babylonian cuneiform that may have been derived from a representation of the abacus
scholars , such as ettore carruccio , that old babylonians may have used the abacus for the operations of addition and subtraction ; however , this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations
greek historian herodotus mentioned the abacus in ancient egypt
he wrote that the egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left , opposite in direction to the greek left - to - right method
archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters
however , wall depictions of this instrument are yet to be discovered
at around 600 bc , persians first began to use the abacus , during the achaemenid empire
under the parthian , sassanian , and iranian empires , scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them – india , china , and the roman empire - which is how the abacus may have been exported to other countries
the earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the greek abacus dates to the 5th century bc
a play by alexis from the 4th century bc mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting , and both diogenes and polybius use the abacus as a metaphor for human behavior , stating that men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less like the pebbles on an abacus
the greek abacus was a table of wood or marble , pre - set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations
this greek abacus was used in achaemenid persia , the etruscan civilization , ancient rome , and the western christian world until the french revolution
a tablet found on the greek island salamis in 1846 ad ( the salamis tablet ) dates to 300 bc , making it the oldest counting board discovered so far
it is a slab of white marble wide , and also from this time frame , the darius vase was unearthed in 1851
it was covered with pictures , including a treasurer holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other
the chinese abacus , also known as the suanpan ( 算盤 / 算盘 , lit
calculating tray ) , is typically one of the top beads is 5 , while one of the bottom beads is 1
each rod has a number under it , showing the place value
the suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center
the prototype of the chinese abacus appeared during the han dynasty , and the beads are oval
the song dynasty and earlier used the 14 type or four - beads abacus similar to the modern abacus including the shape of the beads commonly known as japanese - style abacus
in the early ming dynasty , the abacus began to appear in a 15 ratio
the upper deck had one bead and the bottom had five beads
in the late ming dynasty , the abacus styles appeared in a 25 ratio
the upper deck had two beads , and the bottom had five
various calculation techniques were devised for suanpan enabling efficient calculations
some schools teach students how to use it
in the long scroll along the river during the qingming festival painted by zhang zeduan during the song dynasty ( 960–1297 ) , a suanpan is clearly visible beside an account book and doctors prescriptions on the counter of an apothecarys ( feibao )
the similarity of the roman abacus to the chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other , given evidence of a trade relationship between the roman empire and china
however , no direct connection has been demonstrated , and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental , both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand
where the roman model ( like most modern korean and japanese ) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place , the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2
incidentally , this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system ( or any base up to 18 ) which may have been used for traditional chinese measures of weight
( instead of running on wires as in the chinese , korean , and japanese models , the roman model used grooves , presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower
another possible source of the suanpan is chinese counting rods , which operated with a decimal system but lacked the concept of zero as a placeholder
the zero was probably introduced to the chinese in the tang dynasty ( 618–907 ) when travel in the indian ocean and the middle east would have provided direct contact with india , allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from indian merchants and mathematicians
the normal method of calculation in ancient rome , as in greece , was by moving counters on a smooth table
originally pebbles ( calculi ) were used
later , and in medieval europe , jetons were manufactured
marked lines indicated units , fives , tens , etcetera as in the roman numeral system
this system of counter casting continued into the late roman empire and in medieval europe and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century
writing in the 1st century bc , horace refers to the wax abacus , a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus
one example of archaeological evidence of the roman abacus , shown nearby in reconstruction , dates to the 1st century ad
it has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each
the groove marked i indicates units , x tens , and so on up to millions
the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units , five tens , etcetera , essentially in a bi - quinary coded decimal system , related to the roman numerals
the short grooves on the right may have been used for marking roman ounces ( that is fractions )
the abhidharmakośabhāṣya of vasubandhu ( 316 - 396 ) , a sanskrit work on buddhist philosophy , says that the second - century ce philosopher vasumitra said that placing a wick ( sanskrit vartikā ) on the number one ( ekāṅka ) means it is a one while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred , and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand
it is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been
around the 5th century , indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the abacus
in japan , the abacus is called soroban ( it was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class adopted it , as the class structure obstructed such changes
the 14 abacus , which removes the seldom - used second and fifth bead became popular in the 1940s
todays japanese abacus is a 14 type , four - bead abacus , introduced from china in the muromachi era
it adopts the form of the upper deck one bead and the bottom four beads
the top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is similar to the chinese or korean abacus , and the decimal number can be expressed , so the abacus is designed as a onefour device
the beads are always in the shape of a diamond
the quotient division is generally used instead of the division method ; at the same time , in order to make the multiplication and division digits consistently use the division multiplication
later , japan had a 35 abacus called 天三算盤 , which is now in the ize rongji collection of shansi village in yamagata city
japan also used a 25 type abacus
the four - bead abacus spread , and became common around the world
improvements to the japanese abacus arose in various places
in china an aluminium frame plastic bead abacus was used
the file is next to the four beads , and pressing the clearing button put the upper bead in the upper position , and the lower bead in the lower position
the abacus is still manufactured in japan even with the proliferation , practicality , and affordability of pocket electronic calculators
the use of the soroban is still taught in japanese primary schools as part of mathematics , primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation
using visual imagery can complete a calculation as quickly as a physical instrument
the chinese abacus migrated from china to korea around 1400 ad
the four - beads abacus ( 14 ) was introduced during the goryeo dynasty
the 51 abacus was introduced to korea from china during the ming dynasty
some sources mention the use of an abacus called a nepohualtzintzin in ancient aztec culture
the word nepōhualtzintzin – the account - ; and tzintzin , who were students dedicated to taking the accounts of skies , from childhood
the nepōhualtzintzin was divided into two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord
in the left part were four beads
beads in the first row have unitary values ( 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , and on the right side , three beads had values of 5 , 10 , and 15 , respectively
in order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows , it is enough to multiply by 20 ( by each row ) , the value of the corresponding count in the first row
the device featured 13 rows with 7 beads , 91 in total
this was a basic number for this culture
it had a close relation to natural phenomena , the underworld , and the cycles of the heavens
one nepōhualtzintzin ( 91 ) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts , two nepōhualtzitzin ( 182 ) is the number of days of the corns cycle , from its sowing to its harvest , three nepōhualtzintzin ( 273 ) is the number of days of a babys gestation , and four nepōhualtzintzin ( 364 ) completed a cycle and approximated one year
when translated into modern computer arithmetic , the nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to 18 in floating point , which precisely calculated large and small amounts , although round off was not allowed
the rediscovery of the nepōhualtzintzin was due to the mexican engineer david esparza hidalgo , very old nepōhualtzintzin are attributed to the olmec culture , and some bracelets of mayan origin , as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures
sanchez wrote in arithmetic in maya that another base 5 , base 4 abacus had been found in the yucatán peninsula that also computed calendar data
this was a finger abacus , on one hand , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were used ; and on the other hand 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 were used
note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles
the russian abacus , the schoty ( , counting ) , usually has a single slanted deck , with ten beads on each wire ( except one wire with four beads for quarter - ruble fractions )
older models have another 4 - bead wire for quarter - kopeks , which were minted until 1916
the russian abacus is often used vertically , with each wire running horizontally
the wires are usually bowed upward in the center , to keep the beads pinned to either side
it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right
during manipulation , beads are moved to the left
for easy viewing , the middle 2 beads on each wire ( the 5th and 6th bead ) usually are of a different color from the other eight
likewise , the left bead of the thousands wire ( and the million wire , if present ) may have a different color
the russian abacus was in use in shops and markets throughout the former soviet union , and its usage was taught in most schools until the 1990s
even the 1874 invention of mechanical calculator , odhner arithmometer , had not replaced them in russia ; according to yakov perelman
some businessmen attempting to import calculators into the russian empire were known to leave in despair after watching a skilled abacus operator
likewise , the mass production of felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce abacus use in the soviet union
the russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of domestic microcalculators in 1974
the russian abacus was brought to france around 1820 by mathematician jean - victor poncelet , who had served in napoleons army and had been a prisoner of war in russia
the turks and the armenian people used abacuses similar to the russian schoty
it was named a coulba by the turks and a choreb by the armenians
around the world , abacuses have been used in pre - schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the numeral system and arithmetic
in western countries , a bead frame similar to the russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame is common ( see image )
the wireframe may be used either with positional notation like other abacuses ( thus the 10 - wire version may represent numbers up to 9 , 999 , 999 , 999 ) , or each bead may represent one unit ( for example 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire , so numbers up to 100 may be represented )
in the bead frame shown , the gap between the 5th and 6th wire , corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire , suggests the latter use
teaching multiplication , for example 6 times 7 , may be represented by shifting 7 beads on 6 wires
the red - and - white abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of number - related lessons
the twenty bead version , referred to by its dutch name rekenrek ( calculating frame ) , is often used , either on a string of beads or on a rigid framework
physicist richard feynman was noted for facility in mathematical calculations
he wrote about an encounter in brazil with a japanese abacus expert , who challenged him to speed contests between feynmans pen and paper , and the abacus
the abacus was much faster for addition , somewhat faster for multiplication , but feynman was faster at division
when the abacus was used for a really difficult challenge , that is cube roots , feynman won easily
however , the number chosen at random was close to a number feynman happened to know was an exact cube , allowing him to use approximate methods
learning how to calculate with the abacus may improve capacity for mental calculation
abacus - based mental calculation ( amc ) , which was derived from the abacus , is the act of performing calculations , including addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division , in the mind by manipulating an imagined abacus
it is a high - level cognitive skill that runs calculations with an effective algorithm
people doing long - term amc training show higher numerical memory capacity and experience more effectively connected neural pathways
they are able to retrieve memory to deal with complex processes
since it only requires that the final position of beads be remembered , it takes less memory and less computation time
the binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers
the abacus shows how numbers , letters , and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer , or via ascii
the device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows
the beads represent a switch on the computer in either an on or off position
an adapted abacus , invented by tim cranmer , and called a cranmer abacus is commonly used by visually impaired users
a piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads , keeping them in place while the users manipulate them
the device is then used to perform the mathematical functions of multiplication , division , addition , subtraction , square root , and cube root
although blind students have benefited from talking calculators , the abacus is often taught to these students in early grades
blind students can also complete mathematical assignments using a braille - writer and nemeth code ( a type of braille code for mathematics ) but large multiplication and long division problems are tedious
the abacus gives these students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper
many blind people find this number machine a useful tool throughout life
an acid is a molecule or ion capable of either donating a proton ( that is hydrogen ion , h ) , known as a brønsted–lowry acid , or forming a covalent bond with an electron pair , known as a lewis acid
http / / goldbook
html iupac gold book - acid
the first category of acids are the proton donors , or brønsted–lowry acids
in the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion h3o and are known as arrhenius acids
brønsted and lowry generalized the arrhenius theory to include non - aqueous solvents
a brønsted or arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of
aqueous arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid
acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts
the word acid is derived from the latin acidus / acēre , meaning sour
an aqueous solution of an acid has a ph less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as acid ( as in dissolved in acid ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute
a lower ph means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution
chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic
common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits )
as these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial sense ) can be solutions or pure substances , and can be derived from acids ( in the strict sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases
strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid
the second category of acids are lewis acids , which form a covalent bond with an electron pair
an example is boron trifluoride ( bf3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( nh3 )
lewis considered this as a generalization of the brønsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( h ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs
however , hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other brønsted–lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not lewis acids
conversely , many lewis acids are not arrhenius or brønsted–lowry acids
in modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a brønsted acid and not a lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a lewis acid explicitly as a lewis acid
most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions , or can be dissolved in water , so the arrhenius and brønsted–lowry definitions are the most relevant
the brønsted–lowry definition is the most widely used definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid–base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton ( h ) from an acid to a base
hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions
although alcohols and amines can be brønsted–lowry acids , they can also function as lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms
in 1884 , svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions ( h ) , later described as protons or hydrons
an arrhenius acid is a substance that , when added to water , increases the concentration of h ions in the water
note that chemists often write h ( aq ) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid–base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus , a proton , does not exist alone in water , it exists as the hydronium ion ( h3o ) or other forms ( h5o2 , h9o4 )
thus , an arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water
examples include molecular substances such as hydrogen chloride and acetic acid
an arrhenius base , on the other hand , is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide ( oh− ) ions when dissolved in water
this decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form h2o molecules
due to this equilibrium , any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide
thus , an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration , while an arrhenius base increases it
in an acidic solution , the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10−7 moles per liter
since ph is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions , acidic solutions thus have a ph of less than 7
while the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions , it is also quite limited in its scope
in 1923 , chemists johannes nicolaus brønsted and thomas martin lowry independently recognized that acid–base reactions involve the transfer of a proton
a brønsted–lowry acid ( or simply brønsted acid ) is a species that donates a proton to a brønsted–lowry base
brønsted–lowry acid–base theory has several advantages over arrhenius theory
consider the following reactions of acetic acid ( ch3cooh ) , the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste
both theories easily describe the first reaction ch3cooh acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of h3o when dissolved in water , and it acts as a brønsted acid by donating a proton to water
in the second example ch3cooh undergoes the same transformation , in this case donating a proton to ammonia ( nh3 ) , but does not relate to the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium
nevertheless , ch3cooh is both an arrhenius and a brønsted–lowry acid
brønsted–lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of molecular compounds in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase
hydrogen chloride ( hcl ) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride , nh4cl
in aqueous solution hcl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions
the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrheniuss definition
as with the acetic acid reactions , both definitions work for the first example , where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the hcl solute
the next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton - transfer reactions
in the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia ( dissolved in benzene ) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous hcl and nh3 combine to form the solid
a third , only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by gilbert lewis , which includes reactions with acid–base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer
a lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species ; in other words , it is an electron pair acceptor
brønsted acid–base reactions are proton transfer reactions while lewis acid–base reactions are electron pair transfers
many lewis acids are not brønsted–lowry acids
contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid–base chemistry
in the first reaction a fluoride ion , f− , gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate
fluoride loses a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the b—f bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion
bf3 is a lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride
this reaction cannot be described in terms of brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer
the second reaction can be described using either theory
a proton is transferred from an unspecified brønsted acid to ammonia , a brønsted base ; alternatively , ammonia acts as a lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion
the species that gains the electron pair is the lewis acid ; for example , the oxygen atom in h3o gains a pair of electrons when one of the h—o bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen
depending on the context , a lewis acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile
organic brønsted acids , such as acetic , citric , or oxalic acid , are not lewis acids
they dissociate in water to produce a lewis acid , h , but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a lewis base ( acetate , citrate , or oxalate , respectively , for the acids mentioned )
this article deals mostly with brønsted acids rather than lewis acids
acid–base conjugate pairs differ by one proton , and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton ( protonation and deprotonation , respectively )
note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as
in solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base
the equilibrium constant k is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution
brackets indicate concentration , such that h2o means the concentration of h2o
the acid dissociation constant ka is generally used in the context of acid–base reactions
the numerical value of ka is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants , where the reactant is the acid ( ha ) and the products are the conjugate base and
the stronger of two acids will have a higher ka than the weaker acid ; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton
because the range of possible values for ka spans many orders of magnitude , a more manageable constant , pka is more frequently used , where pka minus ; log10 ka
stronger acids have a smaller pka than weaker acids
experimentally determined pka at 25°c in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material
arrhenius acids are named according to their anions
in the classical naming system , the ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix , according to the table following
the prefix hydro - is used when the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element
for example , hcl has chloride as its anion , so the hydro - prefix is used , and the - ide suffix makes the name take the form hydrochloric acid
in the iupac naming system , aqueous is simply added to the name of the ionic compound
thus , for hydrogen chloride , as an acid solution , the iupac name is aqueous hydrogen chloride
the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton
a strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water ; in other words , one mole of a strong acid ha dissolves in water yielding one mole of h and one mole of the conjugate base , a− , and none of the protonated acid ha
in contrast , a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution
examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) , hydroiodic acid ( hi ) , hydrobromic acid ( hbr ) , perchloric acid ( hclo4 ) , nitric acid ( hno3 ) and sulfuric acid ( h2so4 )
in water each of these essentially ionizes 100
the stronger an acid is , the more easily it loses a proton , two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the h—a bond and the size of atom a , which determines the strength of the h—a bond
acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base
stronger acids have a larger acid dissociation constant , ka and a more negative pka than weaker acids
sulfonic acids , which are organic oxyacids , are a class of strong acids
a common example is toluenesulfonic acid ( tosylic acid )
unlike sulfuric acid itself , sulfonic acids can be solids
in fact , polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable
superacids are acids stronger than 100 sulfuric acid
examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid , magic acid and perchloric acid
superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic , crystalline hydronium salts
they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations
while ka measures the strength of an acid compound , the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph , which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution
the ph of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compounds ka
lewis acids have been classified in the ecw model and it has been shown that there is no one order of acid strengths
it has been shown that to define the order of lewis acid strength at least two properties must be considered
for pearsons qualitative hsab theory the two properties are hardness and strength while for dragos quantitative ecw model the two properties are electrostatic and covalent
monoprotic acids , also known as monobasic acids , are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation ( sometimes called ionization ) as shown below ( symbolized by ha )
common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) and nitric acid ( hno3 )
on the other hand , for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid
examples in organic acids include formic acid ( hcooh ) , acetic acid ( ch3cooh ) and benzoic acid ( c6h5cooh )
polyprotic acids , also known as polybasic acids , are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule , in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule
specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names , such as diprotic ( or dibasic ) acid ( two potential protons to donate ) , and triprotic ( or tribasic ) acid ( three potential protons to donate )
some macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids can have a very large number of acidic protons
a diprotic acid ( here symbolized by h2a ) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph
each dissociation has its own dissociation constant , ka1 and ka2
the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second ( that is , ka1 gt ; ka2 )
for example , sulfuric acid ( h2so4 ) can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion ( hso ) , wherein the ka2 is intermediate strength
the large ka1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid
in a similar manner , the weak unstable carbonic acid ) )
both ka values are small , but ka1 gt ; ka2
a triprotic acid ( h3a ) can undergo one , two , or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants , where ka1 gt ; ka2 gt ; ka3
an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid ( h3po4 ) , usually just called phosphoric acid
all three protons can be successively lost to yield h2po , and finally po , the orthophosphate ion , usually just called phosphate
even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent , the successive ka values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged
an organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid , which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion
although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable , all of the conjugate bases are present in solution
the fractional concentration , α ( alpha ) , for each species can be calculated
for example , a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution h2a , ha− , and a2−
the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph ( which can be converted to the h ) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases
alphaceha - fraccehk1ceh2 cehk1 k1 k2 fracceha -
a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph , for given k1 and k2 , is known as a bjerrum plot
a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n - protic acid that has been deprotonated i - times
alphace hn - i ai - cehn - i displaystyle prodj0ikj over displaystyle sumi0n big cehn - i displaystyle prodj0ikj big
neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base , producing a salt and neutralized base ; for example , hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water
neutralization is the basis of titration , where a ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid
it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with ph 7 , which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction
neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt
an example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride , which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia
conversely , neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt ( for example , sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide )
in order for a protonated acid to lose a proton , the ph of the system must rise above the pka of the acid
the decreased concentration of h in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form ( the deprotonated form of the acid )
in lower - ph ( more acidic ) solutions , there is a high enough h concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form
to determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution , an acid–base titration is commonly performed
a strong base solution with a known concentration , usually naoh or koh , is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added
the titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes , with the base volume on the x - axis and the solutions ph value on the y - axis
the ph of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution
for each diprotic acid titration curve , from left to right , there are two midpoints , two equivalence points , and two buffer regions
due to the successive dissociation processes , there are two equivalence points in the titration curve of a diprotic acid
in other words , the amount of oh− added equals the original amount of h2a at the first equivalence point
the second equivalence point occurs when all hydrogen ions are titrated
therefore , the amount of oh− added equals twice the amount of h2a at this time
for a weak diprotic acid titrated by a strong base , the second equivalence point must occur at ph above 7 due to the hydrolysis of the resulted salts in the solution
at either equivalence point , adding a drop of base will cause the steepest rise of the ph value in the system
a titration curve for a diprotic acid contains two midpoints where phpka
since there are two different ka values , the first midpoint occurs at phpka1 and the second one occurs at phpka2
acids exist universally in our lives
there are both numerous kinds of natural acid compounds with biological functions and massive synthesized acids which are used in many ways
acids are fundamental reagents in treating almost all processes in todays industry
sulfuric acid , a diprotic acid , is the most widely used acid in industry , which is also the most - produced industrial chemical in the world
it is mainly used in producing fertilizer , detergent , batteries and dyes , as well as used in processing many products such like removing impurities
for example , phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers , and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid , purifying the solution and electrowinning
in the chemical industry , acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts
for example , nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate , a fertilizer
additionally , carboxylic acids can be esterified with alcohols , to produce esters
acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling
they may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery , such as sulfuric acid in a car battery
tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind
natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids
citric acid is present in oranges , lemon and other citrus fruits
oxalic acid is present in tomatoes , spinach , and especially in carambola and rhubarb ; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid
ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla ( indian gooseberry ) , lemon , citrus fruits , and guava
many acids can be found in various kinds of food as additives , as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives
phosphoric acid , for example , is a component of cola drinks
acetic acid is used in day - to - day life as vinegar
citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles
carbonic acid is one of the most common acid additives that are widely added in soft drinks
during the manufacturing process , co2 is usually pressurized to dissolve in these drinks to generate carbonic acid
carbonic acid is very unstable and tends to decompose into water and co2 at room temperature and pressure
therefore , when bottles or cans of these kinds of soft drinks are opened , the soft drinks fizz and effervesce as co2 bubbles come out
certain acids are used as drugs
acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers
acids play important roles in the human body
the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules
amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues
fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues
nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of dna and rna and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes
carbonic acid is important for maintenance of ph equilibrium in the body
human bodies contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds , among those dicarboxylic acids play an essential role in many biological behaviors
many of those acids are amino acids which mainly serve as materials for the synthesis of proteins
the rest of the dicarboxylic acids also participate in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds in human bodies
acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry ; for example , sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline
some acids , such as sulfuric , phosphoric , and hydrochloric acids , also effect dehydration and condensation reactions
in biochemistry , many enzymes employ acid catalysis
basic structure of an amino acid
many biologically important molecules are acids
nucleic acids , which contain acidic phosphate groups , include dna and rna
nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organisms characteristics , and is passed from parents to offspring
dna contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits
cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids
an α - amino acid has a central carbon ( the α or alpha carbon ) which is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group ( thus they are carboxylic acids ) , an amino group , a hydrogen atom and a variable group
the variable group , also called the r group or side chain , determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid
in glycine , the simplest amino acid , the r group is a hydrogen atom , but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens , and may contain other elements such as sulfur , oxygen or nitrogen
with the exception of glycine , naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the l - configuration
peptidoglycan , found in some bacterial cell walls contains some d - amino acids
at physiological ph , typically around 7 , free amino acids exist in a charged form , where the acidic carboxyl group ( - cooh ) loses a proton ( - coo− ) and the basic amine group ( - nh2 ) gains a proton ( - nh )
the entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion , with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains
aspartic acid , for example , possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups , for a net charge of −1 at physiological ph
fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology
these contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end
the cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer , a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar , hydrophilic phosphate head groups
membranes contain additional components , some of which can participate in acid–base reactions
in humans and many other animals , hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides , as well as converting the inactive pro - enzyme , pepsinogen into the enzyme , pepsin
some organisms produce acids for defense ; for example , ants produce formic acid
acid–base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing
oxygen gas ( o2 ) drives cellular respiration , the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food , producing carbon dioxide ( co2 ) as a byproduct
oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs , and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation
for example , during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat , releasing co2 into the blood stream
in aqueous solutions such as blood co2 exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion
it is the decrease in ph that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper , expelling the excess co2 and resupplying the cells with o2
aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) is a carboxylic acid cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged or large , polar molecules because of the lipophilic fatty acyl chains comprising their interior
many biologically important molecules , including a number of pharmaceutical agents , are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated , uncharged form but not in their charged form ( that is , as the conjugate base )
for this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods
the charged form , however , is often more soluble in blood and cytosol , both aqueous environments
when the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral ph within the cell , certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble , allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer
acids that lose a proton at the intracellular ph will exist in their soluble , charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target
ibuprofen , aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids
a carboxylic acid has the general formula r - c ( o ) oh , where r is an organic radical
the carboxyl group - c ( o ) oh contains a carbonyl group , co , and a hydroxyl group , o -
halogenation at alpha position increases acid strength , so that the following acids are all stronger than acetic acid
normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group
in vinylogous carboxylic acids , a carbon - carbon double bond separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups
asphalt , also known as bitumen , the word is derived from the ancient greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos
the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world , estimated to contain 10 million tons , is the pitch lake located in la brea in southwest trinidad ( antilles island located on the northeastern coast of venezuela ) , within the siparia regional corporation
in material sciences and engineering , the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance , although there is regional variation as to which term is most common
worldwide , geologists tend to favor the term bitumen for the naturally occurring material
for the manufactured material , which is a refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils , bitumen is the prevalent term in much of the world ; however , in american english , asphalt is more commonly used
to help avoid confusion , the phrases liquid asphalt , asphalt binder , or asphalt cement are used in the colloquially , various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as tar , as in the name of the la brea tar pits , although tar is a different material
naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen
its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at , an area larger than england
asphalt properties change with temperature , which means that there is a specific range where viscosity permits adequate compaction by providing lubrication between particles during the compaction process
low temperature prevents aggregate particles from moving , and the required density is not possible to achieve
the word asphalt is derived from the late middle english , in turn from french asphalte , based on late latin asphalton , asphaltum , which is the latinisation of the greek
which perhaps derives from ( sphallein ) , to cause to fall , baffle , ( in passive ) err , ( in passive ) be balked of
the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects , and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application
specifically , herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall
from the greek , the word passed into late latin , and thence into french ( asphalte ) and english ( asphaltum and asphalt )
in french , the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring asphalt - soaked limestone deposits , and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads
the word bitumen is from latin , and passed via french into english
the latin word traces to the proto - indo - european root gʷet - pitch ; see that link for other cognates
in british english , bitumen is used instead of asphalt
the word asphalt is instead used to refer to asphalt concrete , a mixture of construction aggregate and asphalt itself ( also called tarmac in common parlance )
bitumen mixed with clay was usually called asphaltum , but the term is less commonly used today
in australian english , the word asphalt is used to describe a mix of construction aggregate
bitumen refers to the liquid derived from the heavy - residues from crude oil distillation
in american english , asphalt is equivalent to the british bitumen
however , asphalt is also commonly used as a shortened form of asphalt concrete ( therefore equivalent to the british asphalt or tarmac )
in canadian english , the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil ,
bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi - solid form of petroleum
bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen
the oil sands of alberta , canada are a similar material
neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars
tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and pyrolysis of organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses , whether fossilized as with coal , or freshly harvested
the majority of bitumen , on the other hand , was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited by water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the diagenetic point , where the disorganized fatty hydrocarbon molecules joined together in long chains in the absence of oxygen
bitumen occurs as a solid or highly viscous liquid
it may even be mixed in with coal deposits
bitumen , and coal using the bergius process , can be refined into petrols such as gasoline , and bitumen may be distilled into tar , not the other way around
the naphthene aromatics and polar aromatics are typically the majority components
most natural bitumens also contain organosulfur compounds , resulting in an overall sulfur content of up to 4
nickel and vanadium are found at
the substance is soluble in carbon disulfide
it is commonly modelled as a colloid , with asphaltenes as the dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase
it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt , because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large
muhammad abdul quddus ( 1992 ) , p
99 , in ch
asphalt may be confused with coal tar , which is a visually similar black , thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal
during the early and mid - 20th century , when town gas was produced , coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates
the addition of coal tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmac , which is now used in common parlance to refer to road - making materials
however , since the 1970s , when natural gas succeeded town gas , asphalt has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications
other examples of this confusion include the la brea tar pits and the canadian oil sands , both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar
pitch is another term sometimes informally used at times to refer to asphalt , as in pitch lake
for economic and other reasons , asphalt is sometimes sold combined with other materials , often without being labeled as anything other than simply asphalt

of particular note is the use of re - refined engine oil bottoms – reob or reobsthe residue of recycled automotive engine oil collected from the bottoms of re - refining vacuum distillation towers , in the manufacture of asphalt
reob contains various elements and compounds found in recycled engine oil additives to the original oil and materials accumulating from its circulation in the engine ( typically iron and copper )
some research has indicated a correlation between this adulteration of asphalt and poorer - performing pavement
the majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum
they were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived
under the heat ( above 50°c ) and pressure of burial deep in the earth , the remains were transformed into materials such as bitumen , kerogen , or petroleum
natural deposits of bitumen include lakes such as the pitch lake in trinidad and tobago and lake bermudez in venezuela
natural seeps occur in the la brea tar pits and the mckittrick tar pits in california , as well as in the dead sea
bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as oil sands in alberta , canada , and the similar tar sands in utah , us
the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves , in three huge deposits covering of commercially established oil reserves , giving canada the third largest oil reserves in the world
although historically it was used without refining to pave roads , nearly all of the output is now used as raw material for oil refineries in canada and the united states
the worlds largest deposit of natural bitumen , known as the athabasca oil sands , is located in the mcmurray formation of northern alberta
this formation is from the early cretaceous , and is composed of numerous lenses of oil - bearing sand with up to 20 oil
two smaller but still very large formations occur in the peace river oil sands and the cold lake oil sands , to the west and southeast of the athabasca oil sands , respectively
of the alberta deposits , only parts of the athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining
the other 80 has to be produced by oil wells using enhanced oil recovery techniques like steam - assisted gravity drainage
much smaller heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the uinta basin in utah , us
the tar sand triangle deposit , for example , is roughly 6 bitumen
bitumen may occur in hydrothermal veins
an example of this is within the uinta basin of utah , in the us , where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed gilsonite
these veins formed by the polymerization and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the green river formation during burial and diagenesis
bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites
the vast alberta bitumen resources are considered to have started out as living material from marine plants and animals , mainly algae , that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered alberta
they were covered by mud , buried deeply over time , and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of
due to pressure from the rising of the rocky mountains in southwestern alberta , 80 to 55 million years ago , the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches , thus forming the oil sands
the use of natural bitumen for waterproofing , and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth millennium bc , with a crop storage basket discovered in mehrgarh , of the indus valley civilization , lined with it
by the 3rd millennium bc refined rock asphalt was in use in the region , and was used to waterproof the great bath in mohenjo - daro
in the ancient middle east , the sumerians used natural bitumen deposits for mortar between bricks and stones , to cement parts of carvings , such as eyes , into place , for ship caulking , and for waterproofing
the greek historian herodotus said hot bitumen was used as mortar in the walls of babylon
the long euphrates tunnel beneath the river euphrates at babylon in the time of queen semiramis ( c
800 bc ) was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with bitumen as a waterproofing agent
bitumen was used by ancient egyptians to embalm mummies
the persian word for asphalt is moom , which is related to the english word mummy
the egyptians primary source of bitumen was the dead sea , which the romans knew as palus asphaltites ( asphalt lake )
in approximately 40 ad , dioscorides described the dead sea material as judaicum bitumen , and noted other places in the region where it could be found
pliny also refers to bitumen being found in epirus
bitumen was a valuable strategic resource
it was the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit – between the seleucids and the nabateans in 312 bc
in the ancient far east , natural bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions , leaving a thermoplastic material of higher molecular weight that when layered on objects became quite hard upon cooling
this was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing , such as scabbards and other items statuettes of household deities were also cast with this type of material in japan , and probably also in china
in north america , archaeological recovery has indicated that bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone projectile points to wooden shafts
in canada , aboriginal people used bitumen seeping out of the banks of the athabasca and other rivers to waterproof birch bark canoes , and also heated it in smudge pots to ward off mosquitoes in the summer
in 1553 , pierre belon described in his work observations that pissasphalto , a mixture of pitch and bitumen , was used in the republic of ragusa ( now dubrovnik , croatia ) for tarring of ships
an 1838 edition of mechanics magazine cites an early use of asphalt in france
a pamphlet dated 1621 , by a certain monsieur deyrinys , states that he had discovered the existence ( of asphaltum ) in large quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel , and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – principally in the construction of air - proof granaries , and in protecting , by means of the arches , the water - courses in the city of paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth , which at that time made the water unusable
he expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces in palaces , the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a parisian of that generation
but the substance was generally neglected in france until the revolution of 1830
in the 1830s there was a surge of interest , and asphalt became widely used for pavements , flat roofs , and the lining of cisterns , and in england , some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes
its rise in europe was a sudden phenomenon , after natural deposits were found in france at osbann ( bas - rhin ) , the parc ( ain ) and the puy - de - la - poix ( puy - de - dôme ) , although it could also be made artificially
among the earlier uses of bitumen in the united kingdom was for etching
william salmons polygraphice ( 1673 ) provides a recipe for varnish used in etching , consisting of three ounces of virgin wax , two ounces of mastic , and one ounce of asphaltum
the first british patent for the use of asphalt was cassells patent asphalte or bitumen in 1834
then on 25 november 1837 , richard tappin claridge patented the use of seyssel asphalt ( patent 7849 ) , for use in asphalte pavement , writer is replying to note or query from previous publication , cited as 9th xi
30 having seen it employed in france and belgium when visiting with frederick walter simms , who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to britain
dr lamb phipson writes that his father , samuel ryland phipson , a friend of claridge , was also instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement ( in 1836 )

claridge obtained a patent in scotland on 27 march 1838 , and obtained a patent in ireland on 23 april 1838
in 1851 , extensions for the 1837 patent and for both 1838 patents were sought by the trustees of a company previously formed by claridge
formed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to britain asphalte in its natural state from the mine at pyrimont seysell in france , cite book dateoctober 1837 – december 1838 titlethe civil engineer and architects journal chapterjoint stock companies ( description of asphalte use by claridges company ) volume1 locationlondon page199
in 1838 , there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving asphalt , which had uses beyond paving
for example , asphalt could also be used for flooring , damp proofing in buildings , and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths , both of which were also proliferating in the 19th century
( enter asphalt into the search field for list of pages discussing the subject ) one of the earliest surviving examples of its use can be seen at highgate cemetery where it was used in 1839 to seal the roof of the terrace catacombs
on the london stockmarket , there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from france , germany and england
and numerous patents were granted in france , with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in england due to their similarity to each other
in england , claridges was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s
in 1914 , claridges company entered into a joint venture to produce tar - bound macadam , two products resulted , namely clarmac , and clarphalte , with the former being manufactured by clarmac roads and the latter by claridges patent asphalte co
, although clarmac was more widely used

bitumen was thought in 19th century britain to contain chemicals with medicinal properties
extracts from bitumen were used to treat catarrh and some forms of asthma and as a remedy against worms , especially the tapeworm
the first use of bitumen in the new world was by indigenous peoples
on the west coast , as early as the 13th century , the tongva , luiseño and chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits
all three groups used the substance as an adhesive
it is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items for example , it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles
it was also used in decorations
small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations
it was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water , possibly poisoning those who drank the water
asphalt was used also to seal the planks on ocean - going canoes
asphalt was first used to pave streets in the 1870s
at first naturally occurring bituminous rock was used , such as at ritchie mines in macfarlan in ritchie county , west virginia from 1852 to 1873
in 1876 , asphalt - based paving was used to pave pennsylvania avenue in washington dc , in time for the celebration of the national centennial
in the horse - drawn era , us streets were mostly unpaved and covered with dirt or gravel
especially where mud or trenching often made streets difficult to pass , pavements were sometimes made of diverse materials including wooden planks , cobble stones or other stone blocks , or bricks
unpaved roads produced uneven wear and hazards for pedestrians
in the late 19th century with the rise of the popular bicycle , bicycle clubs were important in pushing for more general pavement of streets
in 1900 , manhattan alone had 130 , 000 horses , pulling streetcars , wagons , and carriages , and leaving their waste behind
they were not fast , and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets
small towns continued to rely on dirt and gravel , but larger cities wanted much better streets
they looked to wood or granite blocks by the 1850s
in 1890 , a third of chicagos 2000 miles of streets were paved , chiefly with wooden blocks , which gave better traction than mud
brick surfacing was a good compromise , but even better was asphalt paving , which was easy to install and to cut through to get at sewers
with london and paris serving as models , washington laid 400 , 000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882 ; it became the model for buffalo , philadelphia and elsewhere
by the end of the century , american cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving , well ahead of brick
the streets became faster and more dangerous so electric traffic lights were installed
electric trolleys ( at 12 miles per hour ) became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers until they bought automobiles after 1945 and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort on asphalt highways
canada has the worlds largest deposit of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands , and canadian first nations along the athabasca river had long used it to waterproof their canoes
in 1719 , a cree named wa - pa - su brought a sample for trade to henry kelsey of the hudsons bay company , who was the first recorded european to see it
however , it wasnt until 1787 that fur trader and explorer alexander mackenzie saw the athabasca oil sands and said , at about 24 miles from the fork ( of the athabasca and clearwater rivers ) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance
the value of the deposit was obvious from the start , but the means of extracting the bitumen was not
the nearest town , fort mcmurray , alberta , was a small fur trading post , other markets were far away , and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving
in 1915 , sidney ells of the federal mines branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in edmonton , alberta
other roads in alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands , but it was generally not economic
during the 1920s dr
karl clark of the alberta research council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur robert fitzsimmons
bitumen was used in early photographic technology
in 1826 , or 1827 , it was used by french scientist joseph nicéphore niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature
the bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera
exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble , so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light - struck areas remained
many hours of exposure in the camera were required , making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography , but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes
bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century
although widely used for a time , it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting , especially when mixed with the most common diluents , such as linseed oil , varnish and turpentine
unless thoroughly diluted , bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact
the use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings , for instance those of delacroix
perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is théodore géricaults raft of the medusa ( 1818–1819 ) , where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle
the vast majority of refined asphalt is used in construction primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications
according to the requirements of the end use , asphalt is produced to specification
this is achieved either by refining or blending
it is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year
approximately 85 of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads
it is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways , car parks and footways
typically , the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand , gravel and crushed rock with asphalt , which acts as the binding agent
other materials , such as recycled polymers ( for example , rubber tyres ) , may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended
a further 10 of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications , where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable
the remaining 5 of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials , such as pipe coatings , carpet tile backing and paint
asphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures , systems , and components , such as the following
asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5 asphalt cement and 95 aggregates ( stone , sand , and gravel )
due to its highly viscous nature , asphalt cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility
the temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt and the aggregates , but warm - mix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required
the weight of an asphalt pavement depends upon the aggregate type , the asphalt , and the air void content
an average example in the united states is about 112 pounds per square yard , per inch of pavement thickness
when maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements , such as milling to remove a worn or damaged surface , the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures
the asphalt in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes
a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year
according to industry surveys conducted annually by the federal highway administration and the national asphalt pavement association , more than 99 of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements , roadbeds , shoulders and embankments or stockpiled for future use
asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world
due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly , it is widely used for runways
mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt ( asphalt concrete ) in that it has a higher asphalt ( binder ) content , usually around 7–10 of the whole aggregate mix , as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete , which has only around 5 asphalt
this thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground
mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of thick
a number of technologies allow asphalt to be applied at mild temperatures
the viscosity can be lowered by emulsfying the asphalt by the addition of fatty amines
2–25 is the content of these emulsifying agents
the cationic amines enhance the binding of the asphalt to the surface of the crushed rock
asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications
chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock , gravel or crushed slag
slurry seal is a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road
cold - mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot - mixed asphalt , several inches in depth , and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot - mix asphalt to create low - cost pavements
bitumen emulsion based techniques are known to be useful for all classes of roads , their use may also be possible in the following applications 1
asphalts for heavily trafficked roads ( based on the use of polymer modified emulsions ) 2
warm emulsion based mixtures , to improve both their maturation time and mechanical properties 3
half - warm technology , in which aggregates are heated up to 100 degrees , producing mixtures with similar properties to those of hot asphalts 4
high performance surface dressing
synthetic crude oil , also known as syncrude , is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in canada
bituminous sands are mined using enormous ( 100 - ton capacity ) power shovels and loaded into even larger ( 400 - ton capacity ) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility
the process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by dr
karl clark of the university of alberta during the 1920s
after extraction from the sand , the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent
this synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment
by 2015 canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over
in alberta , five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products the suncor energy upgrader near fort mcmurray , alberta produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel ; the syncrude canada , canadian natural resources , and nexen upgraders near fort mcmurray produce synthetic crude oil ; and the shell scotford upgrader near edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby shell oil refinery
canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as venezuelan extra - heavy and mexican heavy oil in chemical composition , and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery
many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non - upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline , diesel fuel , and refined asphalt without any preprocessing
this is particularly common in areas such as the us gulf coast , where refineries were designed to process venezuelan and mexican oil , and in areas such as the us midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined
given the choice , such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower , and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline
by 2015 canadian production and exports of non - upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over per day , of which about 65 was exported to the united states
because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines , non - upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with natural - gas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil , called synbit
however , to meet international competition , much non - upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen , conventional crude oil , synthetic crude oil , and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as western canadian select
this sour , heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as mexican mayan or arabian dubai crude
asphalt was used starting in the 1960s as a hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium - activity salts ( mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate ) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds
bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha - emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in france , belgium and japan , but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues ( risks of fire , as occurred in a bituminisation plant at tokai works in japan ) and long - term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations
one of the main problems is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water
asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis
a second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve
the high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix
the water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts , the asphalt acting as a semi - permeable membrane
this also causes the matrix to swell
the swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar
if not properly managed , this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium - level waste
when the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling , encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere
the high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks
the presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions , preventing the reduction of redox - sensitive radionuclides
under their higher valences , radionuclides of elements such as selenium , technetium , uranium , neptunium and plutonium have a higher solubility and are also often present in water as non - retarded anions
this makes the disposal of medium - level bituminised waste very challenging
different types of asphalt have been used blown bitumen ( partly oxidized with air oxygen at high temperature after distillation , and harder ) and direct distillation bitumen ( softer )
blown bitumens like mexphalte , with a high content of saturated hydrocarbons , are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen , with a low content of saturated hydrocarbons and a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons
concrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered a safer alternative by the nuclear industry and the waste management organisations
roofing shingles and roll roofing account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption
other uses include cattle sprays , fence - post treatments , and waterproofing for fabrics
asphalt is used to make japan black , a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel , and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink , and to make the color darker
asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process
about 40 , 000 , 000 tons were produced in 1984
it is obtained as the heavy ( that is , difficult to distill ) fraction
material with a boiling point greater than around 500°c is considered asphalt
vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil ( such as naphtha , gasoline and diesel )
the resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications
in a de - asphalting unit , the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules , which are then separated
further processing is possible by blowing the product namely reacting it with oxygen
this step makes the product harder and more viscous
asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around
sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity ; upon delivery , these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture
this mixture is often called bitumen feedstock , or bfs
some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm
the backs of tippers carrying asphalt , as well as some handling equipment , are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release
diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns
naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from oil sands , currently under development in alberta , canada
canada has most of the worlds supply of natural bitumen , covering 140 , 000 square kilometres ( an area larger than england ) , giving it the second - largest proven oil reserves in the world
the athabasca oil sands are the largest bitumen deposit in canada and the only one accessible to surface mining , although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods
because of oil price increases after 2003 , producing bitumen became highly profitable , but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again
by 2014 , canadian crude bitumen production averaged about per day by 2020
the total amount of crude bitumen in alberta that could be extracted is estimated to be about would last about 200 years
although uncompetitive economically , asphalt can be made from nonpetroleum - based renewable resources such as sugar , molasses and rice , corn and potato starches
asphalt can also be made from waste material by fractional distillation of used motor oil , which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills
use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates , resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently
nonpetroleum - based asphalt binders can be made light - colored
lighter - colored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation , reducing their contribution to the urban heat island effect
parking lots that use asphalt alternatives are called green parking lots
selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in native deposits in selenice , in albania , the only european asphalt mine still in use
the bitumen is found in the form of veins , filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction
the bitumen content varies from 83 to 92 ( soluble in carbon disulphide ) , with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point ( ring and ball ) around 120°c
the insoluble matter , consisting mainly of silica ore , ranges from 8 to 17
albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the romans
after centuries of silence , the first mentions of albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868 , when the frenchman coquand published the first geological description of the deposits of albanian bitumen
in 1875 , the exploitation rights were granted to the ottoman government and in 1912 , they were transferred to the italian company simsa
since 1945 , the mine was exploited by the albanian government and from 2001 to date , the management passed to a french company , which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale
today the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines ( deep and extending over several km ) still remain viable
selenizza is produced primarily in granular form , after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine
selenizzahttp / / www
php , selenice bitumi for more information about selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector
it is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing
it may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks , but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants
other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks , bridges , car - parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry
selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags
a life - cycle assessment study of the natural selenizza compared with petroleum asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza is about half the impact of the road asphalt produced in oil refineries in terms of carbon dioxide emission
asphalt is a commonly recycled material in the construction industry
the two most common recycled materials that contain asphalt are reclaimed asphalt pavement ( rap ) and reclaimed asphalt shingles ( ras )
rap is recycled at a greater rate than any other material in the united states ,
asphalt naturally becomes stiffer over time due to oxidation , evaporation , exudation , and physical hardening
for information on the different types of ras and associated health and safety concerns , see asphalt shingles
for information on in - place recycling methods used to restore pavements and roadways , see road surface
although asphalt typically makes up only 4 to 5 percent ( by weight ) of the pavement mixture , as the pavements binder , it is also the most expensive part of the cost of the road - paving material
during asphalts early use in modern paving , oil refiners gave it away
however , asphalt is a highly traded commodity today
its prices increased substantially in the early 21st century
a government report states
in 2002 , asphalt sold for approximately 160 per ton
by the end of 2006 , the cost had doubled to approximately 320 per ton , and then it almost doubled again in 2012 to approximately 610 per ton
the report indicates that an average 1 - mile ( 1 - kilometer ) - long , four - lane highway would include 300 tons of asphalt , which , in 2002 would have cost around 48 , 000
by 2006 this would have increased to 96 , 000 and by 2012 to 183 , 000 an increase of about 135 , 000 for every mile of highway in just 10 years
people can be exposed to asphalt in the workplace by breathing in fumes or skin absorption
the national institute for occupational safety and health ( niosh ) has set a recommended exposure limit of 5mg / m3 over a 15 - minute period
asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving , roofing , and other applications
in examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt , the international agency for research on cancer ( iarc ) determined that it is the application parameters , predominantly temperature , that affect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic hazard / risk of the asphalt emissions
iarc has classified paving asphalt fumes as a class 2b possible carcinogen , indicating inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans
in 2020 , scientists reported that asphalt currently is a significant and largely overlooked source of air pollution in urban areas , especially during hot and sunny periods
an asphalt - like substance found in the himalayas and known as shilajit is sometimes used as an ayurveda medicine , but is not in fact a tar , resin or asphalt

the american national standards institute ( ansi ) is a private non - profit organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products , services , processes , systems , and personnel in the united states
the organization also coordinates standards with international standards so that american products can be used worldwide
ansi accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other standards organizations , government agencies , consumer groups , companies , and others
these standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent , that people use the same definitions and terms , and that products are tested the same way
ansi also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards
the organizations headquarters are in washington , ansis operations office is located in new york city
the ansi annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications , membership dues and fees , accreditation services , fee - based programs , and international standards programs
ansi was most likely originally formed in 1918 , when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the american engineering standards committee ( aesc )
in 1928 , the aesc became the american standards association ( asa )
in 1966 , the asa was reorganized and became united states of america standards institute ( usasi )
the present name was adopted in 1969
had been members of the united engineering society ( ues )
at the behest of the aiee , they invited the government departments of war , navy ( combined in 1947 to become the department of defense or dod ) and commerce to join in founding a national standards organization
according to adam stanton , the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919 , aesc started as an ambitious program and little else
staff for the first year consisted of one executive , clifford lepage , who was on loan from a founding member , asme
an annual budget of 7 , 500 was provided by the founding bodies
in 1931 , the organization ( renamed asa in 1928 ) became affiliated with the national committee of the international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) , which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards
ansis members are government agencies , organizations , academic and international bodies , and individuals
in total , the institute represents the interests of more than 270 , 000 companies and organizations and 30 million professionals worldwide
although ansi itself does not develop standards , the institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations
ansi accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the institutes requirements for openness , balance , consensus , and due process
ansi also designates specific standards as american national standards , or ans , when the institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable , accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders
voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers
there are approximately 9 , 500 american national standards that carry the ansi designation
in addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the united states , ansi promotes the use of standards internationally , advocates policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations , and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate
the institute is the official representative to the two major international standards organizations , the international organization for standardization ( iso ) , as a founding member , and the international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) , via the national committee ( usnc )
ansi participates in almost the entire technical program of both the iso and the iec , and administers many key committees and subgroups
in many instances , standards are taken forward to iso and iec , through ansi or the usnc , where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards
adoption of iso and iec standards as american standards increased from 0 in 1986 to 15 in may 2012
each of the panels works to identify , coordinate , and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas
in 2009 , ansi and the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) formed the nuclear energy standards coordination collaborative ( nescc )
nescc is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry
in logic and philosophy , an argument is an attempt to persuade someone of something , or give evidence or reasons for accepting a particular conclusion
apollo 11 ( july 16–24 , 1969 ) was the american spaceflight that first landed humans on the moon
commander neil armstrong and lunar module pilot buzz aldrin landed the apollo lunar module eagle on july 20 , 1969 , at 2017 utc , and armstrong became the first person to step onto the moons surface six hours and 39 minutes later , on july 21 at 0256 utc
aldrin joined him 19 minutes later , and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named tranquility base upon landing
armstrong and aldrin collected of lunar material to bring back to earth as pilot michael collins flew the command module columbia in lunar orbit , and were on the moons surface for 21 hours , 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin columbia
apollo 11 was launched by a saturn v rocket from kennedy space center on merritt island , florida , on july 16 at 1332 utc , and it was the fifth crewed mission of nasas apollo program
the apollo spacecraft had three parts a command module ( cm ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , the only part that returned to earth ; a service module ( sm ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( lm ) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit
after being sent to the moon by the saturn vs third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit
armstrong and aldrin then moved into eagle and landed in the sea of tranquility on july 20
the astronauts used eagle they returned to earth and splashed down in the pacific ocean on july 24 after more than eight days in space
armstrongs first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live tv to a worldwide audience
he described the event as one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind
apollo 11 effectively proved us victory in the space race to demonstrate spaceflight superiority , by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by president john kennedy , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
in the late 1950s and early 1960s , the united states was engaged in the cold war , a geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union
this precipitated the sputnik crisis , and triggered the space race to prove which superpower would achieve superior spaceflight capability
which aimed to launch a man into earth orbit
nearly a month later , on may 5 , 1961 , alan shepard became the first american in space , completing a 15 - minute suborbital journey
after being recovered from the atlantic ocean , he received a congratulatory telephone call from eisenhowers successor , john kennedy
since the soviet union had higher lift capacity launch vehicles , kennedy chose , from among options presented by nasa , a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry , so that the us and soviet union would be starting from a position of equality
a crewed mission to the moon would serve this purpose
on may 25 , 1961 , kennedy addressed the united states congress on urgent national needs and declared
on september 12 , 1962 , kennedy delivered another speech before a crowd of about 40 , 000 people in the rice university football stadium in houston , texas
a widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows
quotethere is no strife , no prejudice , no national conflict in outer space as yet
its hazards are hostile to us all
its conquest deserves the best of all mankind , and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again
but why , some say , the moon why choose this as our goal and they may well ask , why climb the highest mountain why , 35 years ago , fly the atlantic why does rice play texas
in spite of that , the proposed program faced the opposition of many americans and was dubbed a moondoggle by norbert wiener , a mathematician at the massachusetts institute of technology
the effort to land a man on the moon already had a name project apollo
kennedy again proposed a joint expedition to the moon in a speech to the united nations general assembly on september 20 , 1963
an early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and earth orbit rendezvous
a space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up
in july 1962 nasa head james webb announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used and that the apollo spacecraft would have three major parts a command module ( cm ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that returned to earth ; a service module ( sm ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( lm ) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the moon , and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit
project apollo was abruptly halted by the apollo 1 fire on january 27 , 1967 , in which astronauts gus grissom , ed white , and roger chaffee died , and the subsequent investigation
and in december apollo 8 tested it in lunar orbit
and in may apollo 10 conducted a dress rehearsal in lunar orbit
by july 1969 , all was in readiness for apollo 11 to take the final step onto the moon
the soviet union appeared to be winning the space race by beating the us to firsts , but its early lead was overtaken by the us gemini program and soviet failure to develop the n1 launcher , which would have been comparable to the saturn
the initial crew assignment of commander neil armstrong , command module pilot ( cmp ) jim lovell , and lunar module pilot ( lmp ) buzz aldrin on the backup crew for apollo lovell and aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of gemini 12
due to design and manufacturing delays in the lm , apollo9 swapped prime and backup crews , and armstrongs crew became the backup for apollo
there would be one change
michael collins , the cmp on the apollo lovell took his place on the apollo apollo 11 was the second american mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience , the next was sts - 26 in 1988
deke slayton gave armstrong the option to replace aldrin with lovell , since some thought aldrin was difficult to work with
armstrong had no issues working with aldrin but thought it over for a day before declining
he thought lovell deserved to command his own mission ( eventually apollo 13 )
the apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of apollo 12
instead , they forged an amiable working relationship
armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof , but collins , who considered himself a loner , confessed to rebuffing aldrins attempts to create a more personal relationship
armstrong did not agree with the assessment , and said all the crews i was on worked very well together
the backup crew consisted of lovell as commander , william anders as cmp , and haise as lmp
anders had flown with lovell on apollo in early 1969 , he accepted a job with the national aeronautics and space council effective august 1969 , and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time
ken mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with anders as backup cmp in case apollo 11 was delayed past its intended july launch date , at which point anders would be unavailable
by the normal crew rotation in place during apollo , lovell , mattingly , and haise were scheduled to fly on apollo 14 after backing up for apollo 11
later , lovells crew was forced to switch places with alan shepards tentative apollo 13 crew to give shepard more training time
during projects mercury and gemini , each mission had a prime and a backup crew
for apollo , a third crew of astronauts was added , known as the support crew
the support crew maintained the flight plan , checklists and mission ground rules , and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes
they developed procedures , especially those for emergency situations , so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators , allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them
the capsule communicator ( capcom ) was an astronaut at the mission control center in houston , texas , who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew
the apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by collins , who wanted a symbol for peaceful lunar landing by the united states
at lovells suggestion , he chose the bald eagle , the national bird of the united states , as the symbol
tom wilson , a simulator instructor , suggested an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful mission
collins added a lunar background with the earth in the distance
the sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction ; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the earth instead of the left
aldrin , armstrong and collins decided the eagle and the moon would be in their natural colors , and decided on a blue and gold border
armstrong was concerned that eleven would not be understood by non - english speakers , so they went with apollo 11 ,
an illustrator at the manned spacecraft center ( msc ) did the artwork , which was then sent off to nasa officials for approval
after some discussion , the olive branch was moved to the talons
the design was also used for the smaller susan anthony dollar unveiled in 1979
after the crew of apollo 10 named their spacecraft charlie brown and snoopy , assistant manager for public affairs julian scheer wrote to george low , the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office at the msc , to suggest the apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft
the name snowcone was used for the cm and haystack was used for the lm in both internal and external communications during early mission planning
the lm was named eagle after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia
at scheers suggestion , the cm was named columbia after columbiad , the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft ( also from florida ) in jules vernes 1865 novel from the earth to the moon
it also referred to columbia , a historical name of the united states
in collins 1976 book , he said columbia was in reference to christopher columbus
the astronauts had personal preference kits ( ppks ) , small bags containing personal items of significance they wanted to take with them on the mission
neil armstrongs lm ppk contained a piece of wood from the wright brothers 1903 wright flyer along with a diamond - studded astronaut pin originally given to slayton by the widows of the apollo
nasas apollo site selection board announced five potential landing sites on february 8 , 1968
these were the result of two years worth of studies based on high - resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the lunar orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the surveyor program
the landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required , clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering , and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar
scientific value was not a consideration
areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on earth were often found to be totally unacceptable
the original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed , as no such site was found
1 and3 was in the central bay ( sinus medii ) ; and sites5 were in the ocean of storms ( oceanus procellarum )
the requirement for the sun angle was particularly restrictive , limiting the launch date to one day per month
a landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience
2 , with sites 35 as backups in the event of the launch being delayed
in may 1969 , apollo 10s lunar module flew to within 2 , and reported it was acceptable
during the first press conference after the apollo 11 crew was announced , the first question was , which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface slayton told the reporter it had not been decided , and armstrong added that it was not based on individual desire
one of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander , which matched what had been done on gemini missions , reporters wrote in early 1969 that aldrin would be the first man to walk on the moon , and associate administrator george mueller told reporters he would be first as well
aldrin heard that armstrong would be the first because armstrong was a civilian , which made aldrin livid
aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first , but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign
attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict , slayton told aldrin that armstrong would be first since he was the commander
the decision was announced in a press conference on april 14 , 1969
for decades , aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar modules hatch location
because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small , maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult
the crew tried a simulation in which aldrin left the spacecraft first , but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress
while this was enough for mission planners to make their decision , aldrin and armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring
the media accused armstrong of exercising his commanders prerogative to exit the spacecraft first
the ascent stage of lm - 5 eagle arrived at the kennedy space center on january 8 , 1969 , followed by the descent stage four days later , and csm - 107 columbia on january 23
the csm was mated on january 29 , and moved from the operations and checkout building to the vehicle assembly building on april 14
the s - ivb third stage of saturn v as - 506 had arrived on january 18 , followed by the s - ii second stage on february 6 , s - ic first stage on february 20 , and the saturn v instrument unit on february 27
at 1230 on may 20 , the fueling was completed by three hours before launch
slayton roused the crew shortly after 0400 , and they showered , shaved , and had the traditional pre - flight breakfast of steak and eggs with slayton and the backup crew
they then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen
at 0630 , they headed out to launch complex 39
haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch
over 450 personnel were at the consoles in the firing room
an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site
dignitaries included the chief of staff of the united states army , general william westmoreland , four cabinet members , 19 state governors , 40 mayors , 60 ambassadors and 200 congressmen
vice president spiro agnew viewed the launch with former president lyndon johnson and his wife lady bird johnson
around 3 , 500 media representatives were present
saturn v as - 506 launched apollo 11 on july 16 , 1969 , at 133200 utc ( 93200 edt )
at 13 seconds into the flight , the launch vehicle began to roll into its flight azimuth of 72°
full shutdown of the first - stage engines occurred about 2minutes and 8
apollo 11 entered a near - circular earth orbit at an altitude of , twelve minutes into its flight
after one and a half orbits , a second ignition of the s - ivb engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the moon with the trans - lunar injection ( tli ) burn at 162213 utc
about 30 minutes later , with collins in the left seat and at the controls , the transposition , docking , and extraction maneuver was performed
this involved separating columbia from the spent s - ivb stage , turning around , and docking with eagle still attached to the stage
after the lm was extracted , the combined spacecraft headed for the moon , while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the moon
this was done to avoid the third stage colliding with the spacecraft , the earth , or the moon
a slingshot effect from passing around the moon threw it into an orbit around the sun
on july 19 at 172150 utc , apollo 11 passed behind the moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit
in the thirty orbits that followed , the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern sea of tranquility about it lay about 5 landing site , and 8s crash site
at 125200 utc on july 20 , aldrin and armstrong entered eagle , and began the final preparations for lunar descent
collins , alone aboard columbia , inspected eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged , and that the landing gear was correctly deployed
armstrong exclaimed the eagle has wings
as the descent began , armstrong and aldrin found themselves passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early , and reported that they were long ; they would land miles west of their target point
eagle was traveling too fast
the problem could have been mascons—concentions of high mass in a region or regions of the moons crust that contains a gravitational anomaly , potentially altering eagles trajectory
flight director gene kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel
or it could have been the result of eagle
five minutes into the descent burn , and margaret hamilton , the director of apollo flight computer programming at the mit charles stark draper laboratory later recalled
during the mission , the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position , causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time
software engineer don eyles concluded in a 2005 guidance and control conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first uncrewed lm in apollo 5
having the rendezvous radar on ( so it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort ) should have been irrelevant to the computer , but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions , depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up
the extra spurious cycle stealing , as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter , caused the computer alarms
when armstrong again looked outside , he saw that the computers landing target was in a boulder - strewn area just north and east of a above the surface , armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site
armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it
as he got closer , now from the surface , with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining
lunar dust kicked up by the lms engine began to impair his ability to determine the spacecrafts motion
some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud , and armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecrafts speed
a light informed aldrin that at least one of the footpads had touched the surface a few moments before the landing and he said contact light armstrong was supposed to immediately shut the engine down , as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engines own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode , but he forgot
three seconds later , eagle landed and armstrong shut the engine down
aca was the attitude control assembly—the lms control stick
output went to the lgc to command the reaction control system ( rcs ) jets to fire
out of detent meant the stick had moved away from its centered position ; it was spring - centered like the turn indicator in a car
lgc address 413 contained the variable that indicated the lm had landed
eagle landed at 201740 utc on sunday july 20 with but post - mission analysis showed that the real figure was probably closer to 50 seconds
apollo 11 landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions , and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning
this was later found to be the result of the propellant sloshing more than expected , uncovering a fuel sensor
on subsequent missions , extra anti - slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this
armstrong acknowledged aldrins completion of the post - landing checklist with engine arm is off , before responding to the capcom , charles duke , with the words , houston , tranquility base here
the eagle has landed
armstrongs unrehearsed change of call sign from eagle to tranquility base emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful
two and a half hours after landing , before preparations began for the eva , aldrin radioed to earth
he then took communion privately
at this time nasa was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist madalyn murray ohair ( who had objected to the apollo 8 genesis readingapollo the schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five - hour sleep period , but they chose to begin preparations for the eva early , thinking they would be unable to sleep
preparations for neil armstrong and buzz aldrin to walk on the moon began at 2343
six hours and thirty - nine minutes after landing armstrong and aldrin were ready to go outside , and eagle was depressurized
eagle armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system ( plss )
at 0251 armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface
the remote control unit on his chest kept him from seeing his feet
climbing down the nine - rung ladder , armstrong pulled a d - ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly ( mesa ) folded against eagle
apollo 11 used slow - scan television ( tv ) incompatible with broadcast tv , so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional tv camera viewed this monitor ( thus , a broadcast of a broadcast ) , significantly reducing the quality of the picture
despite some technical and weather difficulties , ghostly black and white images of the first lunar eva were received and broadcast to at least 600million people on earth
copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available , but recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re - use at nasa
after describing the surface dust as very fine - grained and almost like a powder , at 025615 , footpad and declared thats one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind
armstrong intended to say thats one small step for a man , but the word a is not audible in the transmission , and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast
when later asked about his quote , armstrong said he believed he said for a man , and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the a in square brackets
one explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words for a together ; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to earth , partly because of storms near parkes observatory
a more recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the a may have been spoken but obscured by static
other analysis points to the claims of static and slurring as face - saving fabrication , and that armstrong himself later admitted to misspeaking the line
about seven minutes after stepping onto the moons surface , armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick
he then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh
this was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the eva and return to the lm
he removed the tv camera from the mesa and made a panoramic sweep , then mounted it on a tripod
the tv camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the eva
still photography was accomplished with a hasselblad camera that could be operated hand held or mounted on armstrongs apollo space suit
aldrin joined armstrong on the surface
he described the view with the simple phrase magnificent desolation
armstrong said moving in the lunar gravity , one - sixth of earths , was even perhaps easier than the simulations its absolutely no trouble to walk around
aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around , including two - footed kangaroo hops
the plss backpack created a tendency to tip backward , but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance
loping became the preferred method of movement
the astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead
the fine soil was quite slippery
aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into eagle
the astronauts planted the lunar flag assembly containing a flag of the united states on the lunar surface , in clear view of the tv camera
aldrin remembered , of all the jobs i had to do on the moon the one i wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising
into the hard lunar surface
aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of tv viewers
but he gave a crisp west point salute
before aldrin could take a photo of armstrong with the flag , president richard nixon spoke to them through a telephone - radio transmission , which nixon called the most historic phone call ever made from the white house
armstrong thank you , mr
its a great honor and privilege for us to be here , representing not only the united states , but men of peace of all nations , and with interest and a curiosity , and men with a vision for the future
its an honor for us to be able to participate here today
they deployed the easep , which included a passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes and a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment
then armstrong walked deep
the astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles
many of the surface activities took longer than expected , so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes
aldrin shoveled two types of rocks were found in the geological samples basalt and breccia
while on the surface , armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the lm ladder , bearing two drawings of earth ( of the western and eastern hemispheres ) , an inscription , and signatures of the astronauts and president nixon
the inscription read
at the behest of the nixon administration to add a reference to god , nasa included the vague date as a reason to include , which stands for anno domini , in the year of our lord ( although it should have been placed before the year , not after )
mission control used a coded phrase to warn armstrong his metabolic rates were high , and that he should slow down
he was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out
as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk , mission control granted the astronauts a 15 - minute extension
aldrin entered eagle first
with some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing
presidential speech writer william safire had prepared an in event of moon disaster announcement for nixon to read in the event the apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the moon
according to the plan , mission control would close down communications with the lm , and a clergyman would commend their souls to the deepest of the deep in a public ritual likened to burial at sea
the last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to rupert brookes first world war poem , the soldier
while moving inside the cabin , aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for liftoff from the moon
there was a concern this would prevent firing the engine , stranding them on the moon
a felt - tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch
after more than the disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the us congress , a listing of members of the four committees of the house and senate responsible for the nasa legislation , and the names of nasas past and then - current top management
after about seven hours of rest , the crew was awakened by houston to prepare for the return flight
two and a half hours later , at 175400 utc , they lifted off in eagle film taken from the lm ascent stage upon liftoff from the moon reveals the american flag , planted some subsequent apollo missions planted their flags farther from the lm
during his day flying solo around the moon , collins never felt lonely
although it has been said not since adam has any human known such solitude , in the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the earth while columbia passed round the far side of the moon , the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness , but rather awareness , anticipation , satisfaction , confidence , almost exultation
one of collins first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground
to give collins an idea where to look , mission control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about
just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit , mission control informed collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant
if it became too cold , parts of columbia might freeze
mission control advised him to assume manual control and implement environmental control system malfunction procedure 17
instead , collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again , and carried on with normal housekeeping chores , while keeping an eye on the temperature
when columbia came back around to the near side of the moon again , he was able to report that the problem had been resolved
for the next couple of orbits , he described his time on the back side of the moon as relaxing
after aldrin and armstrong completed their eva , collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous
while the flight plan called for eagle to meet up with columbia , collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly columbia down to meet eagle
eagle rendezvoused with columbia at 2124 utc on july 21 , and the two docked at 2135
eagle just before the apollo 12 flight , it was noted that eagle was still likely to be orbiting the moon
later nasa reports mentioned that eagle in 2021 , however , some calculations show that the lander may still be in orbit
on july 23 , the last night before splashdown , the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which collins commented
on the return to earth , a bearing at the guam tracking station failed , potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the earth return
a regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director , charles force , had his ten - year - old son greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease
greg was later thanked by armstrong
the aircraft carrier was selected as the primary recovery ship ( prs ) for apollo 11 on june 5 , replacing its sister ship , the lph on reaching pearl harbor on july 5 , hornet embarked the sikorsky sh - 3 sea king helicopters of hs - 4 , a unit which specialized in recovery of apollo spacecraft , specialized divers of udt detachment apollo , a 35 - man nasa recovery team , and about 120 media representatives
to make room , most of hornet
on july 12 , with apollo 11 still on the launch pad , hornet departed pearl harbor for the recovery area in the central pacific ,
s carrier onboard delivery aircraft
weather satellites were not yet common , but us air force captain hank brandli had access to top - secret spy satellite images
he realized that a storm front was headed for the apollo recovery area
poor visibility which could make locating the capsule difficult , and strong upper - level winds which would have ripped their parachutes to shreds according to brandli , posed a serious threat to the safety of the mission
this altered the flight plan
a different sequence of computer programs was used , one never before attempted
in a conventional entry , trajectory event p64 was followed by p67
for a skip - out re - entry , p65 and p66 were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip
in this case , because they were extending the re - entry but not actually skipping out , p66 was not invoked and instead , p65 led directly to p67
the crew were also warned they would not be in a full - lift ( heads - down ) attitude when they entered p67
; the second , to
before dawn on july 24 , hornet launched four sea king helicopters and three grumman e - 1 tracers
two of the e - 1s were designated as air boss while the third acted as a communications relay aircraft
two of the sea kings carried divers and recovery equipment
the third carried photographic equipment , and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon
s drogue parachutes were deployed
this was observed by the helicopters
seven minutes later columbia struck the water forcefully south of johnston atoll , and at seas and winds at with visibility of reconnaissance aircraft flying to the original splashdown location reported the conditions brandli and houston had predicted
during splashdown , columbia landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation bags activated by the astronauts
more divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for astronaut extraction
the divers then passed biological isolation garments ( bigs ) to the astronauts , and assisted them into the life raft
the possibility of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote , but nasa took precautions at the recovery site
the astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and columbia wiped with povidone - iodine to remove any lunar dust that might be present
the astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter
bigs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board hornet
the raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk
after touchdown on hornet at 1753 utc , the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay , where the astronauts walked the this practice would continue for two more apollo missions , apollo 12 and apollo 14 , before the moon was proven to be barren of life , and the quarantine process dropped
nixon welcomed the astronauts back to earth
he told them as a result of what youve done , the world has never been closer together before
in accordance with the extra - terrestrial exposure law , a set of regulations promulgated by nasa on july 16 to codify its quarantine protocol , on august 10 , 1969 , the interagency committee on back contamination met in atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts , on those who had joined them in quarantine ( nasa physician william carpentier and mqf project engineer john hirasaki ) ,
on august 13 , the three astronauts rode in ticker - tape parades in their honor in new york and chicago , with an estimated six million attendees
on the same evening in los angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight , attended by members of congress , 44 governors , chief justice of the united states warren burger and his predecessor , earl warren , and ambassadors from 83 nations at the century plaza hotel
nixon and agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the presidential medal of freedom
the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of congress on september 16 , 1969
they presented two us flags , one to the house of representatives and the other to the senate , that they had carried with them to the surface of the moon
this celebration began a 38 - day world tour that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with the leaders of many countries
humans walking on the moon and returning safely to earth accomplished kennedys goal set eight years earlier
in mission control during the apollo 11 landing , kennedys speech flashed on the screen , followed by the words task accomplished , july 1969
the success of apollo 11 demonstrated the united states technological superiority ;
new phrases permeated into the english language
if they can send a man to the moon , why cant they became a common saying following apollo 11
while most people celebrated the accomplishment , disenfranchised americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in america , evidenced by protesters led by ralph abernathy outside of kennedy space center the day before apollo 11 launched
prayed for the astronauts
the poem starts with
twenty percent of the worlds population watched humans walk on the moon for the first time
while apollo 11 sparked the interest of the world , the follow - on apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation
one possible explanation was the shift in complexity
landing someone on the moon was an easy goal to understand ; lunar geology was too abstract for the average person
another is that kennedys goal of landing humans on the moon had already been accomplished
while most americans were proud of their nations achievements in space exploration , only once during the late 1960s did the gallup poll indicate that a majority of americans favored doing more in space as opposed to doing less
by 1973 , 59 percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration
the space race had been won , and cold war tensions were easing as the us and soviet union entered the era of détente
this was also a time when inflation was rising , which put pressure on the government to reduce spending
what saved the space program was that it was one of the few government programs that had achieved something great
drastic cuts , warned caspar weinberger , the deputy director of the office of management and budget , might send a signal that our best years are behind us
after the apollo 11 mission , officials from the soviet union said landing humans on the moon was dangerous and unnecessary
at the time the soviet union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically
the soviets publicly denied there was a race to the moon , and indicated they were not making an attempt
the publics reaction in the soviet union was mixed
the soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing , which affected the reaction
a portion of the populace did not give it any attention , and another portion was angered by it
the apollo 11 landing is referenced in the songs armstrong , aldrin and collins by the byrds on the 1969 album ballad of easy rider and coon on the moon by howlin wolf on the 1973 album the back door wolf
the command module columbia went on a tour of the united states , visiting 49 state capitals , the district of columbia , and anchorage , alaska
columbia was moved in 2017 to the nasm mary baker engen restoration hangar at the steven udvar - hazy center in chantilly , virginia , to be readied for a four - city tour titled destination moon the apollo 11 mission
this included space center houston from october 14 , 2017 , to march 18 , 2018 , the saint louis science center from april 14 to september 3 , 2018 , the senator john heinz history center in pittsburgh from september 29 , 2018 , to february 18 , 2019 , and its last location at museum of flight in seattle from march 16 to september 2 , 2019
continued renovations at the smithsonian allowed time for an additional stop for the capsule , and it was moved to the cincinnati museum center
the ribbon cutting ceremony was on september 29 , 2019
for 40 years armstrongs and aldrins space suits were displayed in the museums apollo to the moon exhibit ,
the descent stage of the lm eagle remains on the moon
in 2009 , the lunar reconnaissance orbiter ( lro ) imaged the various apollo landing sites on the surface of the moon , for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules , scientific instruments , and foot trails made by the astronauts
in march 2012 a team of specialists financed by amazon founder jeff bezos located the f - 1 engines from the s - ic stage that launched apollo 11 into space
they were found on the atlantic seabed using advanced sonar scanning
the main repository for the apollo moon rocks is the lunar sample laboratory facility at the lyndon johnson space center in houston , texas
for safekeeping , there is also a smaller collection stored at white sands test facility near las cruces , new mexico
most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture
they are handled only indirectly , using special tools
over 100 research laboratories around the world conduct studies of the samples , and approximately 500 samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year
in november 1969 , nixon asked nasa to make up about 250 presentation apollo 11 lunar sample displays for 135 nations , the fifty states of the united states and its possessions , and the united nations
each display included moon dust from apollo 11
the rice - sized particles were four small pieces of moon soil weighing about 50mg and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a united states half dollar coin
this acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust
the apollo 11 lunar sample displays were given out as goodwill gifts by nixon in 1970
the passive seismic experiment ran until the command uplink failed on august 25 , 1969
the downlink failed on december 14 , 1969
, the lunar laser ranging experiment remains operational
in 2015 , after armstrong died in 2012 , his widow contacted the national air and space museum to inform them she had found a white cloth bag in one of armstrongs closets
the bag contained various items , which should have been left behind in the lunar module , including the 16mm data acquisition camera that had been used to capture images of the first moon landing
the camera is currently on display at the national air and space museum
on july 15 , 2009 , life
com released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by life photographer ralph morse prior to the apollo 11 launch
it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments
the john kennedy presidential library and museum set up an adobe flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of apollo 11 from launch to landing on the moon
on july 20 , 2009 , armstrong , aldrin , and collins met with us president barack obama at the white house
on august 7 , 2009 , an act of congress awarded the three astronauts a congressional gold medal , the highest civilian award in the united states
the bill was sponsored by florida senator bill nelson and florida representative alan grayson
a group of british scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the moon landing
on june 10 , 2015 , congressman bill posey introduced resolution 2726 to the 114th session of the united states house of representatives directing the united states mint to design and sell commemorative coins in gold , silver and clad for the 50th anniversary of the apollo 11 mission
on january 24 , 2019 , the mint released the apollo 11 fiftieth anniversary commemorative coins to the public on its website
a documentary film , apollo 11 , with restored footage of the 1969 event , premiered in imax on march 1 , 2019 , and broadly in theaters on march 8
the smithsonian institutes national air and space museum and nasa sponsored the apollo 50 festival on the national mall in washington dc
the three day ( july 18 to 20 , 2019 ) outdoor festival featured hands - on exhibits and activities , live performances , and speakers such as adam savage and nasa scientists

apollo 8 ( december 21–27 , 1968 ) was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low earth orbit and the first human spaceflight to reach the moon
the crew orbited the moon ten times without landing , and then departed safely back to earth
these three astronauts—frank borman , james lovell , and william anders—were the first humans to personally witness and photograph the far side of the moon and an earthrise
apollo 8 launched on december 21 , 1968 , and was the second crewed spaceflight mission flown in the united states apollo space program after apollo8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the saturn v rocket , and was the first human spaceflight from the kennedy space center , located adjacent to cape kennedy air force station in florida
originally planned as the second crewed apollo lunar module and command module test , to be flown in an elliptical medium earth orbit in early 1969 , the mission profile was changed in august 1968 to a more ambitious command - module - only lunar orbital flight to be flown in december , as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight
astronaut jim mcdivitts crew , who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low earth orbit , became the crew for the apollo 9apollo8 mission
this left bormans crew with two to three months less training and preparation time than originally planned , and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training
apollo 8 took 68 hours ( almost three days ) to travel the distance to the moon
the crew orbited the moon ten times over the course of twenty hours , during which they made a christmas eve television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the book of genesis
at the time , the broadcast was the most watched tv program ever
apollo11 to fulfill president john kennedys goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade
the apollo8 astronauts returned to earth on december 27 , 1968 , when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern pacific ocean
the crew members were named time magazines men of the year for 1968 upon their return
in the late 1950s and early 1960s , the united states was engaged in the cold war , a geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union
the launch precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race
president john kennedy believed that not only was it in the national interest of the united states to be superior to other nations , but that the perception of american power was at least as important as the actuality
it was therefore intolerable to him for the soviet union to be more advanced in the field of space exploration
he was determined that the united states should compete , and sought a challenge that maximized its chances of winning
the soviet union had heavier - lifting carrier rockets , which meant kennedy needed to choose a goal that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry , one where the us and soviet union would be starting from a position of equality—something spectacular , even if it could not be justified on military , economic , or scientific grounds
after consulting with his experts and advisors , he chose such a project to land a man on the moon and return him to the earth
an early and crucial decision was the adoption of lunar orbit rendezvous , under which a specialized spacecraft would land on the lunar surface
the apollo spacecraft therefore had three primary components a command module ( cm ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that would return to earth ; a service module ( sm ) to provide the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a two - stage lunar module ( lm ) , which comprised a descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to return the astronauts to lunar orbit
the initial crew assignment of frank borman as commander , michael collins as command module pilot ( cmp ) and william anders as lunar module pilot ( lmp ) for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced on november 20 , 1967
collins was replaced by jim lovell in july 1968 , after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair
this was also the first mission to reunite crewmates from a previous mission ( lovell and borman , gemini vii )
the backup crew assignment of neil armstrong as commander , lovell as cmp , and buzz aldrin as lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced at the same time as the prime crew
11 , with aldrin as lmp and collins as cmp
haise served on the backup crew of apollo13 as lmp
during projects mercury and gemini , each mission had a prime and a backup crew
for apollo , a third crew of astronauts was added , known as the support crew
the support crew maintained the flight plan , checklists , and mission ground rules , and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of any changes
the support crew developed procedures in the simulators , especially those for emergency situations , so that the prime and backup crews could practice and master them in their simulator training
8 , the support crew consisted of ken mattingly , vance brand , and gerald carr
the capsule communicator ( capcom ) was an astronaut at the mission control center in houston , texas , who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew
8 , the capcoms were michael collins , gerald carr , ken mattingly , neil armstrong , buzz aldrin , vance brand , and fred haise
the mission control teams rotated in three shifts , each led by a flight director
the directors for apollo
the triangular shape of the insignia refers to the shape of the apollo cm
it shows a red figure8 are the names of the three astronauts
the initial design of the insignia was developed by jim lovell , who reportedly sketched it while riding in the back seat of a t - 38 flight from california to houston shortly after learning of apollo
the crew wanted to name their spacecraft , but nasa did not allow it
the crew would have likely chosen columbiad , 11 cm was named columbia in part for that reason
on september 20 , 1967 , nasa adopted a seven - step plan for apollo missions , with the final step being a moon landing
apollo6 were a missions , tests of the saturn5 was a b mission , a test of the lm in earth orbit
apollo8 was planned as the d mission , a test of the lm in a low earth orbit in december 1968 by james mcdivitt , david scott , and russell schweickart , while bormans crew would fly the e mission , a more rigorous lm test in an elliptical medium earth orbit as apollo
production of the lm fell behind schedule , and when apollo indeed , it was possible that delivery would slip to february or march 1969
following the original seven - step plan would have meant delaying the d and subsequent missions , and endangering the programs goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969 , this csm could be sent all the way to the moon , with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit and returning to earth
the new mission would also allow nasa to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until apollo 10apollo
on august 9 , 1968 , low discussed the idea with gilruth , flight director chris kraft , and the director of flight crew operations , donald slayton
they then flew to the marshall space flight center ( msfc ) in huntsville , alabama , where they met with ksc director kurt debus , apollo program director samuel phillips , rocco petrone , and wernher von braun
kraft considered the proposal feasible from a flight control standpoint ; debus and petrone agreed that the next saturn v , as - 503 , could be made ready by december 1 ; and von braun was confident the pogo oscillation problems that had afflicted apollo8 was officially changed from a d mission to a c - prime lunar - orbit mission
with the change in mission for apollo 8 , slayton asked mcdivitt if he still wanted to fly it
mcdivitt turned it down ; his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the lm , and that was what he still wanted to do
slayton then decided to swap the prime and backup crews of the dmissions
this swap also meant a swap of spacecraft , requiring bormans crew to use csm - 103 , while mcdivitts crew would use csm - 104 , since cm - 104 could not be made ready by december
david scott was not happy about giving up cm - 103 , the testing of which he had closely supervised , for cm - 104 , although the two were almost identical , and anders was less than enthusiastic about being an lmp on a flight with no lm
instead , in order that the spacecraft would have the correct weight and balance , apollo lm test article , a boilerplate model of lm - 3
added pressure on the apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the soviet unions cosmonauts on a similar circumlunar mission before the end of 1968
the apollo 8 crew , now living in the crew quarters at kennedy space center , received a visit from charles lindbergh and his wife , anne morrow lindbergh , the night before the launch

the saturn v rocket used by apollov ( 5 ) rocket to be used in the apollo - saturn ( as ) program
when it was erected in the vehicle assembly building on december 20 , 1967 , it was thought that the rocket would be used for an uncrewed earth - orbit test flight carrying a boilerplate command and service module
teams from the msfc went to work on the problems of primary concern was the pogo oscillation , which would not only hamper engine performance , but could exert significant g - forces on a crew
a task force of contractors , nasa agency representatives , and msfc researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated , causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket
a system that used helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed
of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight
researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum , causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two
when an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two , it had accidentally shut down engine threes liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection
as a result , engine three failed within one second of engine twos shutdown
further investigation revealed the same problem for the third - stage engine—a faulty igniter line
the team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits , hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches
the teams tested their solutions in august 1968 at the msfc
a saturn stage ic was equipped with shock - absorbing devices to demonstrate the teams solution to the problem of pogo oscillation , while a saturn stage ii was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions
once nasa administrators were convinced that the problems had been solved , they gave their approval for a crewed mission using as - 503
the apollo 8 spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on september 21 , and the rocket made the slow 9 through 11
final testing of modifications to address the problems of pogo oscillation , ruptured fuel lines , and bad igniter lines took place on december 18 , three days before the scheduled launch
as the first crewed spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body , apollo circular earth parking orbit
apollo and a perigee of over the 2
this was followed by a trans - lunar injection ( tli ) burn of the s - ivb third stage for 318 seconds , accelerating the lm test article from an orbital velocity of this speed was slightly less than the earths escape velocity of 8 into an elongated elliptical earth orbit , close enough to the moon to be captured by the moons gravity
the standard lunar orbit for apollo missions was planned as a nominal and an apolune of , with an orbital period of 128 minutes
apollo 8 was launched at 125100 utc ( 075100 eastern standard time ) on december 21 , 1968 , using the saturn vs three stages to achieve earth orbit
, and the s - ii second stage landed at the s - ivb third stage injected the craft into earth orbit and remained attached to perform the tli burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon
once the vehicle reached earth orbit , both the crew and houston flight controllers spent the next 2 the proper operation of the s - ivb third stage of the rocket was crucial , and in the last uncrewed test , it had failed to reignite for this burn
hours , 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch he radioed , apollo this communication meant that mission control had given official permission for apollo over the next five minutes , the spacecrafts speed increased from
after the s - ivb had placed the mission on course for the moon , the command and service modules ( csm ) , the remaining apollo to their velocity away from the earth , but borman did not want to lose sight of the s - ivb
after discussion , the crew and mission control decided to burn in the earth direction to increase speed , but at
five hours after launch , mission control sent a command to the s - ivb to vent its remaining fuel , changing its trajectory
the s - ivb , with the test article attached , posed no further hazard to apollo solar orbit with an inclination of 23° from the plane of the ecliptic , and an orbital period of 340 days
the apollo 8 crew were the first humans to pass through the van allen radiation belts , which extend up to milligray ( mgy ; during a year , the average human receives a dose of 2mgy )
to record the actual radiation dosages , each crew member wore a personal radiation dosimeter that transmitted data to earth , as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew
by the end of the mission , the crew members experienced an average radiation dose of 1 mgy
lovells main job as command module pilot was as navigator
although mission control normally performed all the actual navigation calculations , it was necessary to have a crew member adept at navigation so that the crew could return to earth in case communication with mission control was lost
lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft , measuring the angle between a star and the earths ( or the moons ) horizon
this task was made difficult by a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft , which made it hard to distinguish the stars
the first mid - course correction came eleven hours into the flight
the crew had been awake for more than 16 hours
before launch , nasa had decided at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise
borman started the first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises
testing on the ground had shown that the service propulsion system ( sps ) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first by burning the engine for a short period
this first correction burn was only 2 seconds and added about this change was less than the planned 8 trajectory was found to be perfect
about an hour after starting his sleep shift , borman obtained permission from ground control to take a seconal sleeping pill
the pill had little effect
borman eventually fell asleep , and then awoke feeling ill
he vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea ; this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces , which the crew cleaned up as well as they could
borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems , but lovell and anders wanted to inform mission control
the crew decided to use the data storage equipment ( dse ) , which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to mission control at high speed
after recording a description of bormans illness they asked mission control to check the recording , stating that they would like an evaluation of the voice comments
the apollo 8 crew and mission control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second - floor control room ( there were two identical control rooms in houston , on the second and third floors , only one of which was used during a mission )
the conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that bormans illness was either a 24 - hour flu , as borman thought , or a reaction to the sleeping pill
space adaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft ( mercury and gemini ) , because those astronauts could not move freely in the small cabins of those spacecraft
the increased cabin space in the apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement , contributing to symptoms of space sickness for borman and , later , astronaut rusty schweickart during apollo
the cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight , except for the crews checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course
during this time , nasa scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch
the apollo camera that broadcast in black - and - white only , using a vidicon tube
the camera had two lenses , a very wide - angle ( 160° ) lens , and a telephoto ( 9° ) lens
during this first broadcast , the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the earth appeared from space
however , difficulties aiming the narrow - angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the earth impossible
additionally , without proper filters , the earth image became saturated by any bright source
in the end , all the crew could show the people watching back on earth was a bright blob
after broadcasting for 17 minutes , the rotation of the spacecraft took the high - gain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday
by this time , the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts
lovell went to sleep 32 - and - a - half hours into the flight– three - and - a - half hours before he had planned to
a short while later , anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill
the crew was unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise
two factors made the moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft three of the five windows fogging up due to out - gassed oils from the silicone sealant , and the attitude required for passive thermal control
it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time
apollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the flight
this time , the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the earth through the telephoto lens
although difficult to aim , as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft , the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth
the crew spent the transmission describing the earth , what was visible , and the colors they could see
the transmission lasted 23 minutes
at about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight , and 13 hours before entering lunar orbit , the crew of apollo8 became stronger than that of the earth
at the time it happened , apollo from the moon and had a speed of
the last major event before lunar orbit insertion ( loi ) was a second mid - course correction
it was in retrograde ( against the direction of travel ) and slowed the spacecraft down by from the moon , the crew burned the rcs for 11 seconds
they would now pass
at 64 hours into the flight , the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit insertion8 flight journal publishernasa access - datefebruary 7 , 2008 archive - urlhttps / / web

htm archive - datefebruary 4 , 2008 url - statusdead lovell replied , well see you on the other side , and for the first time in history , humans travelled behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth
with ten minutes remaining before loi - 1 , the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in its correct position
at that time , they finally got their first glimpses of the moon
they had been flying over the unlit side , and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface
the loi burn was only two minutes away , so the crew had little time to appreciate the view
the sps was ignited at 69 hours , 8minutes and 78 spacecraft in orbit around the moon
the crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives
if the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time , the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even been flung off into space
if it had lasted too long , they could have struck the moon
after making sure the spacecraft was working , they finally had a chance to look at the moon , which they would orbit for the next 20 hours
on earth , mission control continued to wait
if the crew had not burned the engine , or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time , the crew would have appeared early from behind the moon
exactly at the calculated moment the signal was received from the spacecraft , indicating it was in a orbit around the moon
after reporting on the status of the spacecraft , lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like
lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over
one of the crews major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on the moon , especially one in mare tranquillitatis that was planned as the apollo8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site
a film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record one frame per second of the moon below
bill anders spent much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest
by the end of the mission , the crew had taken over eight hundred 70mm still photographs and
throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with earth , borman kept asking how the data for the sps looked
he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary
he also asked that they receive a go / no go decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit
as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon , the crew set up equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface
anders described the craters that they were passing over
at the end of this second orbit , they performed an 11 - second loi - 2 burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to
throughout the next two orbits , the crew continued to check the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the moon
during the third pass , borman read a small prayer for his church
he had been scheduled to participate in a service at st
christophers episcopal church near seabrook , texas , but due to the apollo8 flight , he was unable to attend
a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control , rod rose , suggested that borman read the prayer , which could be recorded and then replayed during the service
when the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front , the crew witnessed an earthrise in person for the first time in human history
nasas lunar orbiter 1 had taken the first picture of an earthrise from the vicinity of the moon , on august 23 , 1966
due to the synchronous rotation of the moon about the earth , earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface
this is because , as seen from any one place on the moons surface , earth remains in approximately the same position in the lunar sky , either above or below the horizon
earthrise is generally visible only while orbiting the moon , and at selected surface locations near the moons limb , where libration carries the earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon
anders continued to take photographs while lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so that borman could rest
despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft , borman was able to sleep for two orbits , awakening periodically to ask questions about their status
borman awoke fully when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes
they were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for the answers to be repeated
borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good nights sleep in over three days
he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed
anders initially protested , saying that he was fine , but borman would not be swayed
anders finally agreed under the condition that borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic pictures of the moon
borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned , and with so many people expected to be watching , he wanted the crew to be alert
for the next two orbits , anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm
as they rounded the moon for the ninth time , the astronauts began the second television transmission
borman introduced the crew , followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the moon
borman described it as being a vast , lonely , forbidding expanse of nothing
8 , we close with good night , good luck , a merry christmas and god bless all of you—all of you on the good earth
the only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the trans - earth injection ( tei ) , which was scheduled for the burn occurred exactly on time
the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re - emerged from behind the moon at 89 hours , 28 minutes , and 39 seconds , the exact time calculated
when voice contact was regained , lovell announced , please be informed , there is a santa claus , to which ken mattingly , the current capcom , replied , thats affirmative , you are the best ones to know
later , lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings , maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard
he accidentally erased some of the computers memory , which caused the inertial measurement unit ( imu ) to contain data indicating that the module was in the same relative orientation it had been in before lift - off ; the imu then fired the thrusters to correct the modules attitude
once the crew realized why the computer had changed the modules attitude , they realized that they would have to reenter data to tell the computer the modules actual orientation
it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers , using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned , sixteen months later , during the apollo 13apollo
the cruise back to earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft
as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly , the spacecraft would reenter earths atmosphere two - and - a - half days after tei and splash down in the pacific
this time , they gave a tour of the spacecraft , showing how an astronaut lived in space
when they finished broadcasting , they found a small present from slayton in the food locker a real turkey dinner with stuffing , in the same kind of pack given to the troops in vietnam
another slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature bottles of brandy , which borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed
they remained unopened , even years after the flight
there were also small presents to the crew from their wives
the next day , at about 124 hours into the mission , the sixth and final tv transmission showed the missions best video images of the earth , during a four - minute broadcast
after two uneventful days , the crew prepared for reentry
the computer would control the reentry , and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude , with the blunt end forward
in the event of computer failure , borman was ready to take over
separation from the service module prepared the command module for reentry by exposing the heat shield and shedding unneeded mass
the service module would burn up in the atmosphere as planned
as the module hit the thin outer atmosphere , the crew noticed that it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the spacecraft
with the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the spacecraft , apollo , the drogue parachute deployed , stabilizing the spacecraft , followed at in the north pacific ocean , southwest of hawaii at 155142 utc on december 27 , 1968
when the spacecraft hit the water , the parachutes dragged it over and left it upside down , in what was termed stable swell , borman was sick , waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft
the first frogman from aircraft carrier
apollo 8 came at the end of 1968 , a year that had seen much upheaval in the united states and most of the world
8 as its men of the year for 1968 , recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year
they had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the earth and orbit another celestial body
8 was summed up in a telegram from a stranger , received by borman after the mission , that stated simply , thank you apollo
one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that the crew took as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon
it was selected as the first of life magazines 100 photographs that changed the world
apollo 11 astronaut michael collins said , eights momentous historic significance was foremost ; 8 as the most historically significant of all the apollo missions
it is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw—either live or delayed—the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon
8 broadcasts won an emmy award , the highest honor given by the academy of television arts sciences
madalyn murray ohair , an atheist , later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis
ohair wanted the courts to ban american astronauts—who were all government employees—from public prayer in space
it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program
buzz aldrin , on apollo
in 1969 , the united states post office department issued a postage stamp ( scott catalogue 1371 ) commemorating the apollo , the first words of the book of genesis
nfls website erroneously states that anita bryant performed the anthem , but nbcs broadcast of game , available from the paley center for medias collection , shows that geisler performed it
in january 1970 , the spacecraft was delivered to osaka , japan , for display in the pavilion at expo 70
it is now displayed at the chicago museum of science and industry , along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by lovell and the space suit worn by frank borman

apollo 8s historic mission has been depicted and referred to in several forms , both documentary and fiction
the various television transmissions and 16 mm footage shot by the crew of apollo8 , hosted by burgess meredith
other documentaries include race to the moon ( 2005 ) as part of season 18 of american experience apollos daring mission aired on pbs nova in december 2018 , marking the flights 50th anniversary
parts of the mission are dramatized in the 1998 miniseries from the earth to the moon episode 1968
in the credits of the animated film free birds ( 2013 ) a newspaper front page about the apollo 8 mission is doctored to read as one of the most turbulent , tragic years in american history drew to a close , millions around the world were watching and listening as the apollo 8 astronauts – frank gobbler , jim snood , and bill wattles – became the first turkeys to orbit another world
the choral music piece earthrise by luke byrne commemorates the mission
the piece was premièred on january 19 , 2020 , by sydney philharmonia choirs at the sydney opera house
an astronaut ( from the ancient greek ) , meaning star , and ) , meaning sailor ) is a person trained , equipped , and deployed by a human spaceflight program to serve as a commander or crew member aboard a spacecraft
although generally reserved for professional space travelers , the term is sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space , including scientists , politicians , journalists , and tourists
astronaut technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of nationality or allegiance ; however , astronauts fielded by russia or the soviet union are typically known instead as cosmonauts ( from the russian kosmos ( космос ) , meaning space , also borrowed from greek ) in order to distinguish them from american or otherwise nato - oriented space travellers
) , meaning space ) , although its use is somewhat informal and its origin is unclear
in china , the peoples liberation army astronaut corps astronauts and their foreign counterparts are all officially called hángtiānyuán ( , meaning heaven navigator or literally heaven - sailing staff )
since 1961 , 600 astronauts have flown in space
until 2002 , astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments , either by the military or by civilian space agencies
with the suborbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in 2004 , a new category of astronaut was created the commercial astronaut
the criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary , with some focus on the point where the atmosphere becomes so thin that centrifugal force , rather than aerodynamic force , carries a significant portion of the weight of the flight object
the fédération aéronautique internationale ( fai ) sporting code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed the kármán line , at an altitude of in the united states , professional , military , and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of are awarded astronaut wings
of these , 24 people have traveled beyond low earth orbit , either to lunar orbit , the lunar surface , or , in one case , a loop around the moon
of eight x - 15 pilots who exceeded , the man with the longest cumulative time in space is gennady padalka , who has spent 879 days in space
in 1959 , when both the united states and soviet union were planning , but had yet to launch humans into space , nasa administrator keith glennan and his deputy administrator , hugh dryden , discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts
dryden preferred cosmonaut , on the grounds that flights would occur in and to the broader cosmos , while the astro prefix suggested flight specifically to the stars
when the soviet union launched the first man into space , yuri gagarin in 1961 , they chose a term which anglicizes to cosmonaut
a professional space traveler is called an astronaut
the first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by neil jones in his 1930 short story the deaths head meteor
the word itself had been known earlier ; for example , in percy gregs 1880 book across the zodiac , astronaut referred to a spacecraft
in les navigateurs de linfini ( 1925 ) by - rosny aîné , the word astronautique ( astronautic ) was used
the word may have been inspired by aeronaut , an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to balloonists
an early use of astronaut in a non - fiction publication is eric frank russells poem the astronaut , appearing in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary society
the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 , and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year
nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond
nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut corps
by convention , an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency ( or its soviet predecessor ) is called a cosmonaut in english texts
the word is an anglicization of kosmonavt
( although polish also uses
coinage of the term valentina tereshkova was the first female cosmonaut and the first and youngest woman to have flown in space with a solo mission on the vostok 6 in 1963
norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle , and thus became the first american cosmonaut
in chinese , the term , cosmos navigating personnel ) is used for astronauts and cosmonauts in general , while , navigating celestial - heaven personnel ) is used for chinese astronauts
here , , literally heaven - navigating , or spaceflight ) is strictly (
the term taikonaut is used by some english - language news media organizations for professional space travelers from china
this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese peoples daily since the advent of the chinese space program
for its 2022 astronaut group , esa envisions recruiting an astronaut with a physical disability , a category they called parastronauts , with the intention but not guarantee of spaceflight
the categories of disability considered for the program were individuals with lower limb deficiency ( either through amputation or congenital ) , leg length difference , or a short stature ( less than
with the rise of space tourism , nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies
while no nation other than russia ( and previously the soviet union ) , the united states , and china have launched a crewed spacecraft , several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries , for example the soviet - led interkosmos program
inspired partly by these missions , other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage
for example , the term spationaut ( for space ; the malay term / for sky )
in finland , the nasa astronaut timothy kopra , a finnish american , has sometimes been referred to as
across germanic languages , astronaut is used in conjunction with locally derived words like germans raumfahrer , dutchs ruimtevaarder , swedishs rymdfarare and norwegians romfarer
as of 2021 in the united states , astronaut status is conferred on a person depending on the authorizing agency
on july 20 , 2021 , the faa issued an order redefining the eligibility criteria to be an astronaut in response to the private suborbital spaceflights of jeff bezos and richard branson
the new criteria states that one must have demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety , or contributed to
human space flight safety in order to qualify as an astronaut
this new definition excludes bezos and branson
the first human in space was soviet yuri gagarin , who was launched on 12 april 1961 , aboard vostok 1 and orbited around the earth for 108 minutes
the first woman in space was soviet valentina tereshkova , who launched on 16 june 1963 , aboard vostok 6 and orbited earth for almost three days
alan shepard became the first american and second person in space on 5 may 1961 , on a 15 - minute sub - orbital flight aboard freedom 7
the first american to orbit the earth was john glenn , aboard friendship 7 on 20 february 1962
the first american woman in space was sally ride , during space shuttle challengers mission sts - 7 , on 18 june 1983
in 1992 , mae jemison became the first african american woman to travel in space aboard sts - 47
cosmonaut alexei leonov was the first person to conduct an extravehicular activity ( eva ) , ( commonly called a spacewalk ) , on 18 march 1965 , on the soviet unions voskhod 2 mission
this was followed two and a half months later by astronaut ed white who made the first american eva on nasas gemini 4 mission
the first crewed mission to orbit the moon , apollo 8 , included american william anders who was born in hong kong , making him the first asian - born astronaut in 1968
the soviet union , through its intercosmos program , allowed people from other socialist ( that is warsaw pact and other soviet - allied ) countries to fly on its missions , with the notable exceptions of france and austria participating in soyuz tm - 7 and soyuz tm - 13 , respectively
an example is czechoslovak vladimír remek , the first cosmonaut from a country other than the soviet union or the united states , who flew to space in 1978 on a soyuz - u rocket
rakesh sharma became the first indian citizen to travel to space
he was launched aboard soyuz t - 11 , on 2 april 1984
on 23 july 1980 , pham tuan of vietnam became the first asian in space when he flew aboard soyuz 37
in 1988 , abdul ahad mohmand became the first afghan to reach space , spending nine days aboard the mir space station
with the increase of seats on the space shuttle , the began taking international astronauts
in 1983 , ulf merbold of west germany became the first non - us citizen to fly in a us spacecraft
in 1984 , marc garneau became the first of eight canadian astronauts to fly in space ( through 2010 )
in 2002 , mark shuttleworth became the first citizen of an african country to fly in space , as a paying spaceflight participant
in 2003 , ilan ramon became the first israeli to fly in space , although he died during a re - entry accident
on 30 may 2020 , doug hurley and bob behnken became the first astronauts to launch on a private crewed spacecraft , crew dragon
the youngest person to reach space is oliver daemen , who was 18 years and 11 months old when he made a suborbital spaceflight lasting 7 minutes on july 20 , 2021
on the same flight as daemen was 82 year , 6 - month - old wally funk , one of the women dubbed the mercury 13 , and now the oldest person in space
she is the first of the mercury 13 to reach space , although the group was trained concurrently with the all - male mercury 7 , who would all engage in space travel
the oldest person to reach orbit is john glenn , one of the mercury 7 , who was 77 when he flew on sts - 95
as of 2006 , the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven , a record held by both jerry ross and franklin chang - diaz
the farthest distance from earth an astronaut has traveled was , when jim lovell , jack swigert , and fred haise went around the moon during the apollo 13 emergency
the first civilian in space was valentina tereshkova aboard vostok 6 ( she also became the first woman in space on that mission )
tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the ussrs air force , which did not accept female pilots at that time
a month later , joseph albert walker became the first american civilian in space when his x - 15 flight 90 crossed the walker had joined the us army air force but was not a member during his flight
the first people in space who had never been a member of any countrys armed forces were both konstantin feoktistov and boris yegorov aboard voskhod 1
the first non - governmental space traveler was byron lichtenberg , a researcher from the massachusetts institute of technology who flew on sts - 9 in 1983
akiyama suffered severe space sickness during his mission , which affected his productivity
the first self - funded space tourist was dennis tito on board the russian spacecraft soyuz tm - 3 on 28 april 2001
the first person to fly on an entirely privately funded mission was mike melvill , piloting spaceshipone flight 15p on a suborbital journey , although he was a test pilot employed by scaled composites and not an actual paying space tourist
seven others have paid the russian space agency to fly into space
the first nasa astronauts were selected for training in 1959
the earliest astronauts for both the us and the ussr tended to be jet fighter pilots , and were often test pilots
once selected , nasa astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas , including training for extravehicular activity in a facility such as nasas neutral buoyancy laboratory
astronauts - in - training ( astronaut candidates ) may also experience short periods of weightlessness ( microgravity ) in an aircraft called the vomit comet , the nickname given to a pair of modified kc - 135s ( retired in 2000 and 2004 , respectively , and replaced in 2005 with a c - 9 ) which perform parabolic flights
astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in high - performance jet aircraft
this is mostly done in t - 38 jet aircraft out of ellington field , due to its proximity to the johnson space center
ellington field is also where the shuttle training aircraft is maintained and developed , although most flights of the aircraft are conducted from edwards air force base
astronauts in training must learn how to control and fly the space shuttle and , it is vital that they are familiar with the international space station so they know what they must do when they get there
mission specialist educators , or educator astronauts , were first selected in 2004 , and as of 2007 , there are three nasa educator astronauts joseph acaba , richard arnold , and dorothy metcalf - lindenburger
barbara morgan , selected as back - up teacher to christa mcauliffe in 1985 , is considered to be the first educator astronaut by the media , but she trained as a mission specialist
astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness , barotrauma , immunodeficiencies , loss of bone and muscle , loss of eyesight , orthostatic intolerance , sleep disturbances , and radiation injury
a 2006 space shuttle experiment found that salmonella typhimurium , a bacterium that can cause food poisoning , became more virulent when cultivated in space
microorganisms have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space
on 31 december 2012 , a nasa - supported study reported that human spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of alzheimers disease
in october 2015 , the nasa office of inspector general issued a health hazards report related to space exploration , including a human mission to mars
over the last decade , flight surgeons and scientists at nasa have seen a pattern of vision problems in astronauts on long - duration space missions
the syndrome , known as visual impairment intracranial pressure ( viip ) , has been reported in nearly two - thirds of space explorers after long periods spent aboard the international space station ( iss )
on 2 november 2017 , scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the brain have been found in astronauts who have taken trips in space , based on mri studies
astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes
being in space can be physiologically deconditioning on the body
it can affect the otolith organs and adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system
zero gravity and cosmic rays can cause many implications for astronauts
in october 2018 , nasa - funded researchers found that lengthy journeys into outer space , including travel to the planet mars , may substantially damage the gastrointestinal tissues of astronauts
the studies support earlier work that found such journeys could significantly damage the brains of astronauts , and age them prematurely
researchers in 2018 reported , after detecting the presence on the international space station ( iss ) of five enterobacter bugandensis bacterial strains , none pathogenic to humans , that microorganisms on iss should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts
a study by russian scientists published in april 2019 stated that astronauts facing space radiation could face temporary hindrance of their memory centers
while this does not affect their intellectual capabilities , it temporarily hinders formation of new cells in brains memory centers
the study conducted by moscow institute of physics and technology ( mipt ) concluded this after they observed that mice exposed to neutron and gamma radiation did not impact the rodents intellectual capabilities
a 2020 study conducted on the brains of eight male russian cosmonauts after they returned from long stays aboard the international space station showed that long - duration spaceflight causes many physiological adaptions , including macro - and microstructural changes
while scientists still know little about the effects of spaceflight on brain structure , this study showed that space travel can lead to new motor skills ( dexterity ) , but also slightly weaker vision , both of which could possibly be long lasting
it was the first study to provide clear evidence of sensorimotor neuroplasticity , which is the brains ability to change through growth and reorganization
space shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appealed to their individual tastes
five months before flight , menus were selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician
foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment
caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure ( bee ) formula
on earth , the average american uses about per day
in russia , cosmonauts are awarded pilot - cosmonaut of the russian federation upon completion of their missions , often accompanied with the award of hero of the russian federation
this follows the practice established in the ussr where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title hero of the soviet union
at nasa , those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver lapel pin
once they have flown in space , they receive a gold pin
astronauts who also have active - duty military status receive a special qualification badge , known as the astronaut badge , after participation on a spaceflight
the united states air force also presents an astronaut badge to its pilots who exceed in altitude
, eighteen astronauts ( fourteen men and four women ) have lost their lives during four space flights
by nationality , thirteen were american , four were russian ( soviet union ) , and one was israeli
, eleven people ( all men ) have lost their lives training for spaceflight eight americans and three russians
six of these were in crashes of training jet aircraft , one drowned during water recovery training , and four were due to fires in pure oxygen environments
astronaut david scott left a memorial consisting of a statuette titled fallen astronaut on the surface of the moon during his 1971 apollo 15 mission , along with a list of the names of eight of the astronauts and six cosmonauts known at the time to have died in service
the space mirror memorial , which stands on the grounds of the kennedy space center visitor complex , is maintained by the astronauts memorial foundation and commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the united states
in addition to twenty nasa career astronauts , the memorial includes the names of an x - 15 test pilot , a air force officer who died while training for a then - classified military space program , and a civilian spaceflight participant
a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being a burthen to their parents or country , and for making them beneficial to the publick , commonly referred to as a modest proposal , is a juvenalian satirical essay written and published anonymously by jonathan swift in 1729
the essay suggests that the impoverished irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food to rich gentlemen and ladies
this satirical hyperbole mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor , predominantly irish catholic ( that is , papists ) as well as british policy toward the irish in general
in english writing , the phrase a modest proposal is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight - faced satire
swifts essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the english language
much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in ireland , so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of swifts solution when he states a young healthy child well nursed , is , at a year old , a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food , whether stewed , roasted , baked , or boiled ; and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee , or a ragout
swift goes to great lengths to support his argument , including a list of possible preparation styles for the children , and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion
he uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then - influential william petty and the social engineering popular among followers of francis bacon
these lampoons include appealing to the authority of a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london and the famous psalmanazar , a native of the island formosa ( who had already confessed to not being from formosa in 1706 )
in the tradition of roman satire , swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by paralipsis
quotetherefore let no man talk to me of other expedients of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound of using neither clothes , nor household furniture , except what is of our own growth and manufacture of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury of curing the expensiveness of pride , vanity , idleness , and gaming in our women of introducing a vein of parsimony , prudence and temperance of learning to love our country , wherein we differ even from laplanders , and the inhabitants of topinamboo of quitting our animosities and factions , nor acting any longer like the jews , who were murdering one another at the very moment their city was taken of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants
lastly , of putting a spirit of honesty , industry , and skill into our shop - keepers , who , if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods , would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price , the measure , and the goodness , nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing , though often and earnestly invited to it
therefore i repeat , let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients , till he hath at least some glympse of hope , that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice
george wittkowsky argued that swifts main target in a modest proposal was not the conditions in ireland , but rather the can - do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills
wittkowsky , swift’s modest proposal , p
76 swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure - all solution
wittkowsky , swift’s modest proposal , p
85 a memorable example of these sorts of schemes involved the idea of running the poor through a joint - stock company
in response , swifts modest proposal was a burlesque of projects concerning the poorwittkowsky , swifts modest proposal , p

a modest proposal also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects
the pamphlet targets reformers who regard people as commodities
wittkowsky , swifts modest proposal , p
101 in the piece , swift adopts the technique of a political arithmeticianwittkowsky , swifts modest proposal , p
95 to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics
critics differ about swifts intentions in using this faux - mathematical philosophy
edmund wilson argues that statistically the logic of the modest proposal can be compared with defence of crime ( arrogated to marx ) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population
wittkowsky counters that swifts satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that springs from a spirit of bitter mockery , not from the delight in calculations for their own sake
wittkowsky , swifts modest proposal , p
author charles smith argues that swifts rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the irish
swifts specific strategy is twofold , using a trapsmith , toward a participatory rhetoric , p
135 to create sympathy for the irish and a dislike of the narrator who , in the span of one sentence , details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty but feels emotion solely for members of his own class
smith , toward a participatory rhetoric , p
136 swifts use of gripping details of poverty and his narrators cool approach towards them create two opposing points of view that alienate the reader , perhaps unconsciously , from a narrator who can view with melancholy detachment a subject that swift has directed us , rhetorically , to see in a much less detached way
swift has his proposer further degrade the irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals
lewis argues that the speaker uses the vocabulary of animal husbandrysmith , toward a participatory rhetoric , p
138 to describe the irish
once the children have been commodified , swifts rhetoric can easily turn people into animals , then meat , and from meat , logically , into tonnage worth a price per pound
swift uses the proposers serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal
in making his argument , the speaker uses the conventional , textbook - approved order of argument from swifts time ( which was derived from the latin rhetorician quintilian )
smith , toward a participatory rhetoric , p
139 the contrast between the careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme and the ridiculousness of the proposal create a situation in which the reader has to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent , thoughtful , and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan
scholars have speculated about which earlier works swift may have had in mind when he wrote a modest proposal
james william johnson argues that a modest proposal was largely influenced and inspired by tertullians apology a satirical attack against early roman persecution of christianity
johnson believes that swift saw major similarities between the two situations
johnson , tertullian and a modest proposal , p
563 johnson notes swifts obvious affinity for tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works a modest proposal and apology
johnson , tertullian and a modest proposal , p
562 in structure , johnson points out the same central theme , that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument , that human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human
stylistically , swift and tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language
in agreement with johnson , donald baker points out the similarity between both authors tones and use of irony
baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic justification by ownership over the subject of sacrificing children—tertullian while attacking pagan parents , and swift while attacking the english mistreatment of the irish poor
baker , tertullian and swifts a modest proposal , p
it has also been argued that a modest proposal was , at least in part , a response to the 1728 essay the generous projector or , a friendly proposal to prevent murder and other enormous abuses , by erecting an hospital for foundlings and bastard children by swifts rival daniel defoe
bernard mandevilles modest defence of publick stews asked to introduce public and state controlled bordellos

robert phiddians article have you eaten yet the reader in a modest proposal focuses on two aspects of a modest proposal the voice of swift and the voice of the proposer
phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of jonathan swift and the apparent economic projections of the proposer
he reminds readers that there is a gap between the narrators meaning and the texts , and that a moral - political argument is being carried out by means of parody
phiddian , have you eaten yet , p
while swifts proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal , george wittkowsky , author of swifts modest proposal the biography of an early georgian pamphlet , argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of swifts time
wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century england
if one regards the modest proposal simply as a criticism of condition , about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that swifts irony brilliantly underscored this fact
phiddian , have you eaten yet , p
at the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century , it was believed that people are the riches of the nation , and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less
phiddian , have you eaten yet , p
4 furthermore , in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry
in those times , the somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity
louis landa composed a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to become a source of wealth to the nation or else they must turn to begging and thievery
this opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for , diversifying their professions , or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in ireland
landa wrote that , swift is maintaining that the maxim—people are the riches of a nation—applies to ireland only if ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism
landa presents swifts a modest proposal as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that people are the riches of a nation
landa , a modest proposal and populousness , p
161 swift presents the dire state of ireland and shows that mere population itself , in irelands case , did not always mean greater wealth and economy
landa , a modest proposal and populousness , p
165 the uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer , not richer
swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens
swift however , landa argues , is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that england was denying irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity
swifts essay created a backlash within the community after its publication
the work was aimed at the aristocracy , and they responded in turn
several members of society wrote to swift regarding the work
lord bathursts letter intimated that he certainly understood the message , and interpreted it as a work of comedy
quotei did immediately propose it to lady bathurst , as your advice , particularly for her last boy , which was born the plumpest , finest thing , that could be seen ; but she fell in a passion , and bid me send you word , that she would not follow your direction , but that she would breed him up to be a parson , and he should live upon the fat of the land ; or a lawyer , and then , instead of being eat himself , he should devour others
you know women in passion never mind what they say ; but , as she is a very reasonable woman , i have almost brought her over now to your opinion ; and having convinced her , that as matters stood , we could not possibly maintain all the nine , she does begin to think it reasonable the youngest should raise fortunes for the eldest and upon that foot a man may perform family duty with more courage and zeal ; for , if he should happen to get twins , the selling of one might provide for the other
or if , by any accident , while his wife lies in with one child , he should get a second upon the body of another woman , he might dispose of the fattest of the two , and that would help to breed up the other
the more i think upon this scheme , the more reasonable it appears to me ; and it ought by no means to be confined to ireland ; for , in all probability , we shall , in a very little time , be altogether as poor here as you are there
i believe , indeed , we shall carry it farther , and not confine our luxury only to the eating of children ; for i happened to peep the other day into a large assembly parliament not far from westminster - hall , and i found them roasting a great fat fellow , walpole again for my own part , i had not the least inclination to a slice of him ; but , if i guessed right , four or five of the company had a devilish mind to be at him
well , adieu , you begin now to wish i had ended , when i might have done it so conveniently
a modest proposal is included in many literature courses as an example of early modern western satire
it also serves as an introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language , lending itself to secondary and post - secondary essay courses
outside of the realm of english studies , a modest proposal is included in many comparative and global literature and history courses , as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts , humanities , and even the social sciences
a modest video game proposal is the title of an open letter sent by activist / former attorney jack thompson on 10 october 2005
the 2012 horror film butcher boys , written by the original the texas chain saw massacre scribe kim henkel , is said to be an updating of jonathan swifts a modest proposal
henkel imagined the descendants of folks who actually took swift up on his proposal
the alkali metals consist of the chemical elements lithium ( li ) , sodium ( na ) , potassium ( k ) , the symbols na and k for sodium and potassium are derived from their latin names , natrium and kalium ; these are still the origins of the names for the elements in some languages , such as german and russian
rubidium ( rb ) , caesium ( cs ) , and francium ( fr )
together with hydrogen they constitute group 1 , which lies in the s - block of the periodic table
all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s - orbital this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties
this family of elements is also known as the lithium family after its leading element
the alkali metals are all shiny , soft , highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge 1
they can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness , exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen ( and in the case of lithium , nitrogen )
because of their high reactivity , they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air , and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements
caesium , the fifth alkali metal , is the most reactive of all the metals
all the alkali metals react with water , with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones
all of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds in order of abundance , sodium is the most abundant , followed by potassium , lithium , rubidium , caesium , and finally francium , which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity ; francium occurs only in minute traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains
experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium ( uue ) , which is likely to be the next member of the group ; none were successful
however , ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects , which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements ; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal , it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues
most alkali metals have many different applications
one of the best - known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks , of which caesium atomic clocks form the basis of the second
a common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium - vapour lamp , which emits light very efficiently
table salt , or sodium chloride , has been used since antiquity
lithium finds use as a psychiatric medication and as an anode in lithium batteries
sodium and potassium are also essential elements , having major biological roles as electrolytes , and although the other alkali metals are not essential , they also have various effects on the body , both beneficial and harmful
sodium compounds have been known since ancient times ; salt ( sodium chloride ) has been an important commodity in human activities , as testified by the english word salary , referring to salarium , money paid to roman soldiers for the purchase of salt
the exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds , and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium , was not known then , and thus antoine lavoisier did not include either alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789
pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in england by humphry davy , who derived it from caustic potash ( koh , potassium hydroxide ) by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile
previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassiums extreme reactivity
later that same year , davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda ( naoh , lye ) by a similar technique , demonstrating the elements , and thus the salts , to be different
petalite ( li al si4o10 ) was discovered in 1800 by the brazilian chemist josé bonifácio de andrada in a mine on the island of utö , sweden
lithium berzelius gave the unknown material the name lithion / lithina , from the greek word λιθoς ( transliterated as lithos , meaning stone ) , to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral , as opposed to potassium , which had been discovered in plant ashes , and sodium , which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood
he named the metal inside the material lithium
lithium , sodium , and potassium were part of the discovery of periodicity , as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same group that were noted by johann wolfgang döbereiner in 1850 as having similar properties
rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered using the spectroscope , invented in 1859 by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff
the names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra a bright red line for rubidium ( from the latin word rubidus , meaning dark red or bright red ) , and a sky - blue line for caesium ( derived from the latin word caesius , meaning sky - blue )
around 1865 john newlands produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight ; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music , where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions
his version put all the alkali metals then known ( lithium to caesium ) , as well as copper , silver , and thallium ( which show the 1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals ) , together into a group
his table placed hydrogen with the halogens
after 1869 , dmitri mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing lithium at the top of a group with sodium , potassium , rubidium , caesium , and thallium
in the 1869 version of mendeleevs periodic table , copper and silver were placed in their own group , aligned with hydrogen and mercury , while gold was tentatively placed under uranium and the undiscovered eka - aluminium in the boron group
after the introduction of the 18 - column table , the group ib elements were moved to their current position in the d - block , while alkali metals were left in group ia
later the groups name was changed to group 1 in 1988
the trivial name alkali metals comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group 1 elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water
there were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium - 227
her first test put the alpha branching at 0 , a figure that she later revised to 1
the next element below francium ( eka - francium ) in the periodic table would be ununennium ( uue ) , element 119
it is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future , given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of einsteinium - 254 , which is favoured for production of ultraheavy elements because of its large mass , relatively long half - life of 270 days , and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms , currently , none of the period 8 elements has been discovered yet , and it is also possible , due to drip instabilities , that only the lower period 8 elements , up to around element 128 , are physically possible
no attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals due to their extremely high atomic number , they would require new , more powerful methods and technology to make
the oddo–harkins rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers , with the exception of hydrogen
this rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another , thus increasing their atomic number
in elements with even atomic numbers , protons are paired , with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other , enhancing stability
all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them ( the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals ) in the solar system
the heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis
lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both big bang nucleosynthesis and in stars the big bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium , beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons , and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple - alpha process , fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon , and skipping over those three elements
the earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the sun , but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system
in turn , the natural history of the earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements
the mass of the earth is approximately 5
the alkali metals , due to their high reactivity , do not occur naturally in pure form in nature
they are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the earths surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica , forming relatively low - density minerals that do not sink down into the earths core
potassium , rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements due to their large ionic radii
sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth , both being among the ten most common elements in earths crust ; sodium makes up approximately 2 of the earths crust measured by weight , making it the sixth most abundant element overall despite their near - equal abundance in earths crust , sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean , both because potassiums larger size makes its salts less soluble , and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium
despite its chemical similarity , lithium typically does not occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size
its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals , where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm , comparable to that of gallium and niobium
commercially , the most important lithium mineral is spodumene , which occurs in large deposits worldwide
rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper
it occurs naturally in the minerals leucite , pollucite , carnallite , zinnwaldite , and lepidolite , cite journal title trace element chemistry of lithium - rich micas from rare - element granitic pegmatites volume 55
caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements , such as antimony , cadmium , tin , and tungsten , but is much less abundant than rubidium
francium - 223 , the only naturally occurring isotope of francium , is the product of the alpha decay of actinium - 227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals
the physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration , which results in weak metallic bonding
hence , all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities , melting and boiling points , as well as heats of sublimation , vaporisation , and dissociation
and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited
their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s - orbital to form the 1 oxidation state , due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy
most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group
the chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity ; thus , the presentation of its properties here is limited
what little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium , as expected
the physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed ; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations
the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other
indeed , the similarity is so great that it is quite difficult to separate potassium , rubidium , and caesium , due to their similar ionic radii ; lithium and sodium are more distinct
for instance , when moving down the table , all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius , decreasing electronegativity , in general , their densities increase when moving down the table , with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium
one of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials lithiums value is anomalous , being more negative than the others
the stable alkali metals are all silver - coloured metals except for caesium , which has a pale golden tint additionally , the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium , strontium , and barium , as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium , are pale yellow , though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium
and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited
indeed , these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble
all the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature
because of this , they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene ( paraffin oil )
the alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table
the second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the nucleus ; thus , they almost always lose a single electron , forming cations
and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials
alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides , which are salts with trapped electrons acting as anions
it is unstable in isolation , due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium , although several derivatives are predicted to be metastable or stable
in aqueous solution , the alkali metal ions form aqua ions of the formula m ( h2o ) n , where n is the solvation number
their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii
in aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the first coordination sphere , also known as the first , or primary , solvation shell
the bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond , with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond
each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules
the latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere
however , for the alkali metal cations , the second coordination sphere is not well - defined as the 1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere , producing a more stable entity
the chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small li cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character
lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii , so that they show some similarities
for example , lithium forms a stable nitride , a property common among all the alkaline earth metals ( magnesiums group ) but unique among the alkali metals
in addition , among their respective groups , only lithium and magnesium form organometallic compounds with significant covalent character ( for example lime and mgme2 )
lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water , and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent
conversely , lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals , probably because li has a high solvation energy
francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high atomic weight , causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent
in contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals , franciums electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesiums due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons ; also , its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low
thus , contrary to expectation , caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals , not francium
all known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium , such as the first ionisation energy , electron affinity , and anion polarisability , though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values , ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at francium
some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity ( 47 kj / mol ) the csfr molecule is polarised as csfr− , showing that the 7s subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the 6s subshell of caesium
additionally , francium superoxide ( fro2 ) is expected to have significant covalent character , unlike the other alkali metal superoxides , because of bonding contributions from the 6p electrons of francium
all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers ; hence , their isotopes must be either odd–odd ( both proton and neutron number are odd ) or odd–even ( proton number is odd , but neutron number is even )
odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers , whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers
odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay , because the decay products are even–even , and are therefore more strongly bound , due to nuclear pairing effects
due to the great rarity of odd–odd nuclei , almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even ( the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium - 6 and the long - lived radioisotope potassium - 40 )
for a given odd mass number , there can be only a single beta - stable nuclide , since there is not a difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd , leaving other nuclides of the same mass number ( isobars ) free to beta decay toward the lowest - mass nuclide
an effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd - numbered elements , such as the alkali metals , tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even - numbered elements
of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope , all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons
beryllium is the single exception to both rules , due to its low atomic number
all of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope sodium - 22 and sodium - 24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically , ( francium had not been discovered yet at that time
) the natural long - lived radioisotope of potassium , potassium - 40 , makes up about 0 of natural potassium , natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive , with 27 being the long - lived radioisotope rubidium - 87
caesium - 137 , with a half - life of 30years , is one of the two principal medium - lived fission products , along with strontium - 90 , which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling , up to several hundred years after use
it constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the chernobyl accident
caesium - 137 undergoes high - energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium - 137
it is a strong emitter of gamma radiation
caesium - 137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way , but must be allowed to decay
its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the short - to - medium - lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts , and is taken up by the body , which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium
the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other
in general , their densities increase when moving down the table , with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium
the atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group
because of the shielding effect , when an atom has more than one electron shell , each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus
in the alkali metals , the outermost electron only feels a net charge of 1 , as some of the nuclear charge ( which is equal to the atomic number ) is cancelled by the inner electrons ; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge
therefore , the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells
since this number increases down the group , the atomic radius must also increase down the group
the ionic radii of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii
this is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons , and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller
additionally , the effective nuclear charge has increased , and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases
the first ionisation energy of an element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge 1
the factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge , the amount of shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus , which is always an outer electron in main group elements
the first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels
since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge ( 1 ) , the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus
since this distance increases down the group , the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases
( this trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic stabilisation and contraction of the 7s orbital , bringing franciums valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non - relativistic calculations
this makes franciums outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus , increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium
the second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second - most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled electron shell and is thus difficult to remove
the reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group
this is the result of a combination of two factors the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals
because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group , it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions , thus increasing reactivity down the group
the atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element , which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length , making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals
adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to ( but not equal to ) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance
this quantity decreases going down the group , and so does the activation energy ; thus , chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group
electronegativity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons ( or electron density ) towards itself
if the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent , the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is 7 in chlorine but is only 1 in sodium
the electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom ( an ionic bond )
however , if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom , the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller , making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium
hence , the larger alkali metal atoms ( further down the group ) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them
as mentioned previously , francium is expected to be an exception
because of the higher electronegativity of lithium , some of its compounds have a more covalent character
for example , lithium iodide ( li i ) will dissolve in organic solvents , a property of most covalent compounds
lithium fluoride ( lif ) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water , and lithium hydroxide ( lioh ) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent
the melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance ( in liquid state ) is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas
as a metal is heated to its melting point , the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around , and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metals boiling point
therefore , the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group
this is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons
as the atoms increase in size going down the group ( because their atomic radius increases ) , the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil , thus lowering the melting and boiling points
( the increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect
the alkali metals all have the same crystal structure ( body - centred cubic ) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms , since density is defined as mass per unit volume
the first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius , which increases going down the group ; thus , the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group
the mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group
thus , the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii ; if figures for these two factors are known , the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated
the resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table , with an exception at potassium
due to having the lowest atomic weight and the largest atomic radius of all the elements in their periods , the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table
lithium , sodium , and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water in fact , lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature
the alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions , which well illustrate group trends
these compounds can be described as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions
all the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water , producing an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas
this reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group lithium reacts steadily with effervescence , but sodium and potassium can ignite , and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers
when an alkali metal is dropped into water , it produces an explosion , of which there are two separate stages
the metal reacts with the water first , breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas ; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals
second , the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas , causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air
this secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water , lake or other body of water , not the initial reaction of the metal with water ( which tends to happen mostly under water )
the alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides
recent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself
all alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water
water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal , leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions
the attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area , causing an exponential increase of ionisation
when the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension , it vigorously explodes
the hydroxides themselves are the most basic hydroxides known , reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides
they easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates , or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides , and may be used to separate thiols from petroleum
they react with amphoteric oxides for example , the oxides of aluminium , zinc , tin , and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates , zincates , stannates , and plumbates
silicon dioxide is acidic , and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass
the alkali metals form many intermetallic compounds with each other and the elements from groups 2 to 13 in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries , some of these have ionic characteristics taking the alloys with gold , the most electronegative of metals , as an example , naau and kau are metallic , but rbau and csau are semiconductors
an alloy of 41 caesium , 47 sodium , and 12 potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy , −78°c
the intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements ( aluminium , gallium , indium , and thallium ) , such as natl , are poor conductors or semiconductors , unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements , implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the zintl anions involved

, chichester , england nevertheless , while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters , group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice
for example , natl consists of a polymeric anion ( —tl−— ) n with a covalent diamond cubic structure with na ions located between the anionic lattice
the larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters
kauzlarich , encyclopedia of inorganic chemistry , 1994 , john wiley sons ,
boron is a special case , being the only nonmetal in group 13
the alkali metal borides tend to be boron - rich , involving appreciable boron–boron bonding involving deltahedral structures ,
lithium and sodium react with carbon to form acetylides , li2c2 and na2c2 , which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with acetylene
potassium , rubidium , and caesium react with graphite ; their atoms are intercalated between the hexagonal graphite layers , forming graphite intercalation compounds of formulae mc60 ( dark grey , almost black ) , mc48 ( dark grey , almost black ) , mc36 ( blue ) , mc24 ( steel blue ) , and mc8 ( bronze ) ( m k , rb , or cs )
these compounds are over 200 times more electrically conductive than pure graphite , suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers ( for example while the larger alkali metals ( k , rb , and cs ) initially form mc8 , the smaller ones initially form mc6 , and indeed they require reaction of the metals with graphite at high temperatures around 500°c to form
when the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the carbon group ( silicon , germanium , tin , and lead ) , ionic substances with cage - like structures are formed , such as the silicides m4si4 ( m k , rb , or cs ) , which contains m and tetrahedral , , and ( ge9 ) 26− , is largely analogous to that of the corresponding silicides
, which appears in tetrapotassium nonastannide ( k4sn9 )
these alkali metal germanides , stannides , and plumbides may be produced by reducing germanium , tin , and lead with sodium metal in liquid ammonia
lithium , the lightest of the alkali metals , is the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen at standard conditions , and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride
nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule ( n2 ) requires a lot of energy
the formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal ( forming m ions ) , the energy required to break the triple bond in n2 and the formation of n3− ions , and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride
the lattice energy is maximised with small , highly charged ions ; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions , only forming ions with a charge of 1 , so only lithium , the smallest alkali metal , can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic , forming lithium nitride
the reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic , so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions
however , sodium and potassium form colourless azide salts involving the linear
all the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula m3pn ( where m represents an alkali metal and pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus , arsenic , antimony , or bismuth )
this is due to the greater size of the p3− and as3− ions , so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form
these are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals for example , potassium has nine different known phosphides , with formulae k3p , k4p3 , k5p4 , kp , k4p6 , k3p7 , k3p11 , kp10 , and kp15
von schnering , hönle phosphides – solid - state chemistry encyclopedia of inorganic chemistry ed
bruce king ( 1994 ) john wiley sons indeed , they have some metallic properties , and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry msb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral zintl structure
all the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen at standard conditions
they form various types of oxides , such as simple oxides ( containing the o2− ion ) , peroxides ( containing the ion ) , and many others
lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide , but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide
potassium forms a mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide , while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively
their reactivity increases going down the group while lithium , sodium and potassium merely burn in air , rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric ( spontaneously catch fire in air )
the smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions ( the peroxide and superoxide ) due to their small size
this attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms , forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom
this causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature
this effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium , allowing them to form the less stable peroxides
rubidium and caesium , at the bottom of the group , are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form
because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed , the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised
( the oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist , but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions
) in addition , the small size of the li and o2− ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure
under controlled conditions , however , all the alkali metals , with the exception of francium , are known to form their oxides , peroxides , and superoxides
the alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful oxidising agents
sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas , which allows them to be used in submarine air purifiers ; the presence of water vapour , naturally present in breath , makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient
potassium , rubidium , and caesium also form sesquioxides m2o3 , which may be better considered peroxide disuperoxides ,
rubidium and caesium can form a great variety of suboxides with the metals in formal oxidation states below 1
such as cs7o ( bronze ) , cs4o ( red - violet ) , cs11o3 ( violet ) , cs3o ( dark green ) , as well as cs7o2
the last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate cs2o
the alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens ( sulfur , selenium , tellurium , and polonium ) , and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known ( with the exception of franciums )
reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides , with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question
for example , sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide ( na2s ) and various polysulfides with the formula na2sx ( x from 2 to 6 ) , containing the and they may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present , and are colourless , water - soluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium
the alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table , the halogens ( fluorine , chlorine , bromine , iodine , and astatine ) , forming salts known as the alkali metal halides
the reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions
the alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides , where the hydride anion acts as a pseudohalide these are often used as reducing agents , producing hydrides , complex metal hydrides , or hydrogen gas
other pseudohalides are also known , notably the cyanides
these are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide , indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely
the polyhalides are rather unstable , although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations
alkali metal cations do not usually form coordination complexes with simple lewis bases due to their low charge of just 1 and their relatively large size ; thus the li ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less ( though exceptions occur for weak complexes )
in aqueous solution , the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes ( m ( h2o ) 6 ) ) , with the exception of the lithium ion , which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes ( li ( h2o ) 4 ) ) ; the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules
because of this , anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants
alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers ( for example 12 - crown - 4 for li , 15 - crown - 5 for na , 18 - crown - 6 for k , and 21 - crown - 7 for rb ) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction
the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid ammonia , forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated metal cation m and solvated electron e− , which react to form hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide ( mnh2 , where m represents an alkali metal ) this was first noted by humphry davy in 1809 and rediscovered by weyl in 1864
the process may be speeded up by a catalyst
similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium , strontium , barium , as well as the divalent lanthanides , europium and ytterbium
the amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution , leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals
in 1907 , charles krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons , which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions
at low concentrations ( below 3 m ) , the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride ; at higher concentrations ( above 3 m ) , the solution is copper - coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury
in addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons , such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation ( m ) , the neutral alkali metal atom ( m ) , diatomic alkali metal molecules ( m2 ) and alkali metal anions ( m− )
these are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas
solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis
being the smallest alkali metal , lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds , which are bonded covalently
organolithium compounds are electrically non - conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures , and tend to form oligomers with the structure ( rli ) x where r is the organic group
as the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom , effectively creating a carbanion , organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles
for use as bases , butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available
an example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ( ( ch3li ) x ) , which exists in tetrameric ( x 4 , tetrahedral ) and hexameric ( x 6 , octahedral ) forms for example , alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls
the reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl , for example , proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde ( using h as the electrophile ) or ketone ( using an alkyl halide ) product
alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may also react with n , n - disubstituted amides to give aldehydes and ketones , and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide
they thermally decompose to eliminate a β - hydrogen , producing alkenes and lithium hydride another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl - and aryllithiums that act as strong bases
unlike the organolithium compounds , the organometallic compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic
the application of organosodium compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from organolithium compounds , which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity
the principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide
sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups
organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility
a notable reagent is schlossers base , a mixture of n - butyllithium and potassium tert - butoxide
this reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium ( kch2chch2 )
cis - 2 - butene and trans - 2 - butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals
whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium , it is slow with the heavier alkali metals
the heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation
organosodium , organopotassium , organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble ( or nearly so ) in nonpolar solvents
alkyl and aryl derivatives of sodium and potassium tend to react with air
they cause the cleavage of ethers , generating alkoxides
unlike alkyllithium compounds , alkylsodiums and alkylpotassiums cannot be made by reacting the metals with alkyl halides because wurtz coupling occurs
as such , they have to be made by reacting alkylmercury compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents
while methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium , methylpotassium is more ionic and has the nickel arsenide structure with discrete methyl anions and potassium cations
the alkali metals and their hydrides react with acidic hydrocarbons , for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes , to give salts
liquid ammonia , ether , or hydrocarbon solvents are used , the most common of which being tetrahydrofuran
the most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide , nac5h5 , an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives
the large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large , aromatic , polarisable radical anions , such as the dark - green sodium naphthalenide , nac10h8•− , a strong reducing agent
upon reacting with oxygen , alkali metals form oxides , peroxides , superoxides and suboxides
however , the first three are more common
the table belowinorganic chemistry by gary miessler and donald tar , 6th edition , pearson shows the types of compounds formed in reaction with oxygen
the compound in brackets represents the minor product of combustion
the alkali metal peroxides are ionic compounds that are unstable in water
the peroxide anion is weakly bound to the cation , and it is hydrolysed , forming stronger covalent bonds
because alkali metal sulfides are essentially salts of a weak acid and a strong base , they form basic solutions
lithium is the only metal that reacts directly with carbon to give dilithium acetylide
na and k can react with acetylene to give acetylides
on reaction with water , they generate hydroxide ions and hydrogen gas
this reaction is vigorous and highly exothermic and the hydrogen resulted may ignite in air or even explode in the case of rb and cs
the alkali metals are very good reducing agents
they can reduce metal cations that are less electropositive
titanium is produced industrially by the reduction of titanium tetrachloride with na at 4000c ( van arkel–de boer process )
alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia or other donor solvents like aliphatic amines or hexamethylphosphoramide to give blue solutions
these solutions are believed to contain free electrons
due to the presence of solvated electrons , these solutions are very powerful reducing agents used in organic synthesis
although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered , there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of hypothetical heavier alkali metals
being the first period 8 element , the undiscovered element ununennium ( element 119 ) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners ; however , it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties
instead of caesium or francium
this is unusual as periodic trends , ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium
this lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununenniums valence electron , increasing ununenniums first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii ; this effect is already seen for francium
the relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununenniums electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium ; indeed , ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it
relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium
the stabilisation of ununenniums valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240pm , which is not seen in any other alkali metal ,
not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium
although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table ( by the aufbau principle ) would put element 169 , unhexennium , under ununennium , dirac - fock calculations predict that the next element after ununennium with alkali - metal - like properties may be element 165 , unhexpentium , which is predicted to have the electron configuration og 5g18 6f14 7d10 8s2 8p1 / 22 9s1
this element would be intermediate in properties between an alkali metal and a group 11 element , and while its physical and atomic properties would be closer to the former , its chemistry may be closer to that of the latter
further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium , having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium , and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium , having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium
unsepttrium , element 173 , may be an even better heavier homologue of ununennium ; with a predicted electron configuration of usb 6g1 , it returns to the alkali - metal - like situation of having one easily removed electron far above a closed p - shell in energy , and is expected to be even more reactive than caesium
the probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unsepttrium have not been explored yet as of 2019 , and they may or may not be able to exist
in periods 8 and above of the periodic table , relativistic and shell - structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate
in addition , the relativistic and shell - structure effects ( which stabilise the s - orbitals and destabilise and expand the d - , f - , and g - orbitals of higher shells ) have opposite effects , causing even larger difference between relativistic and non - relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers
many other substances are similar to the alkali metals in their tendency to form monopositive cations
analogously to the pseudohalogens , they have sometimes been called pseudo - alkali metals
these substances include some elements and many more polyatomic ions ; the polyatomic ions are especially similar to the alkali metals in their large size and weak polarising power
the element hydrogen , with one electron per neutral atom , is usually placed at the top of group 1 of the periodic table for convenience , but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal ; when it is considered to be an alkali metal , it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties
however , the alkali metals form diatomic molecules ( such as dilithium , li2 ) only at high temperatures , when they are in the gaseous state
hydrogen , like the alkali metals , has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogens , but the similarities mostly end there because of the small size of a bare proton h compared to the alkali metal cations
its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration
the first ionisation energy of hydrogen ( 1312 kj / mol ) is much higher than that of the alkali metals
huheey , ; keiter , and keiter , ( 1993 ) inorganic chemistry principles of structure and reactivity , 4th edition , harpercollins , new york , usa
james , and lord , ( 1992 ) macmillans chemical and physical data , macmillan , london , uk
as only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom , hydrogen often behaves like a halogen , forming the negative hydride ion , and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis
( the alkali metals can also form negative ions , known as alkalides , but these are little more than laboratory curiosities , being unstable
) an argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic , unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens
the radius of the h− anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens indeed , h− is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons
the electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 k is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 k at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetal - to - metal transition
the 1s1 electron configuration of hydrogen , while analogous to that of the alkali metals ( ns1 ) , is unique because there is no 1p subshell
hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron h , or gain one to form the hydride ion h−
group 14 is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity , but hydrogen cannot be tetravalent
thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory , although group 1 is the most common placement ( if one is chosen ) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species , being the foundation of acid - base chemistry
as an example of hydrogens unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size , the hydrogen ion is very small ( radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions ) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules
indeed , transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid - base chemistry
the ammonium ion ( for example , most alkali metal salts are soluble in water , a property which ammonium salts share
it has been estimated that the transition from a mixture of ammonia and dihydrogen molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just below 25gpa
under standard conditions , ammonium can form a metallic amalgam with mercury
other pseudo - alkali metals include the alkylammonium cations , in which some of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups
in particular , the quaternary ammonium cations (
furthermore , the nitrogen atom may be replaced by a phosphorus , arsenic , or antimony atom ( the heavier nonmetallic pnictogens ) , creating a phosphonium cation that can itself be substituted similarly ; while stibonium itself is not known , some of its organic derivatives are characterised
cobaltocene , co ( c5h5 ) 2 , is a metallocene , the cobalt analogue of ferrocene
it is a dark purple solid
cobaltocene has 19 valence electrons , one more than usually found in organotransition metal complexes , such as its very stable relative , ferrocene , in accordance with the 18 - electron rule
this additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the co–c bonds
consequently , many chemical reactions of co ( c5h5 ) 2 are characterized by its tendency to lose this extra electron , yielding a very stable 18 - electron cation known as cobaltocenium
many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts , and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate
cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener rhodium to give rhodocene , an even stronger reducing agent
thallium is the heaviest stable element in group 13 of the periodic table
at the bottom of the periodic table , the inert pair effect is quite strong , because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons
that all the known alkali metals display , it was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental europe ( but not in england ) in the years immediately following its discovery , and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in dmitri mendeleevs 1869 periodic table and julius lothar meyers 1868 periodic table
which no known alkali metal displays the sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium
the group 11 metals ( or coinage metals ) , copper , silver , and gold , are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d - shells
physically , they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with post - transition metals
the filled d subshell and free s electron of cu , ag , and au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity
transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between s electrons and the partially filled d subshell that lower electron mobility
in mendeleevs 1871 periodic table , copper , silver , and gold are listed twice , once under group viii ( with the iron triad and platinum group metals ) , and once under group ib
group ib was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative
mendeleevs main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element on that basis , the group 11 elements could not be classified in group ib , due to the existence of copper ( ii ) and gold ( iii ) compounds being known at that time
however , eliminating group ib would make group i the only main group ( group viii was labelled a transition group ) to lack an a–b bifurcation
soon afterward , a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group ib and remove them from group viii for the resulting symmetry this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium - long 18 - column periodic table , which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals
the coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group , due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals ( group 1 p6s1 ; group 11 d10s1 )
however , the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the 1 compounds of both groups , and not their chemical properties
furthermore , they have higher melting points , hardnesses , and densities , and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia , as well as having more covalent character in their compounds
the coinage metals filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals filled p shell , so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower , enabling higher oxidation states than 1 and a richer coordination chemistry , thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character
the production of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances , such as water
from their silicate ores , all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium ( iii ) ions from the ore ( leaching ) , whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide
the remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively ; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride
the result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated
lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides , with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture
the heavier alkali metals , however , are more typically isolated in a different way , where a reducing agent ( typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals ) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride
the liquid or gaseous product ( the alkali metal ) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification
most routes to the pure alkali metals require the use of electrolysis due to their high reactivity ; one of the few which does not is the pyrolysis of the corresponding alkali metal azide , which yields the metal for sodium , potassium , rubidium , and caesium and the nitride for lithium
lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs , brine pools , and brine deposits
the metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride
sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed , but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700°c through the use of a downs cell
extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide
potassium occurs in many minerals , such as sylvite ( potassium chloride )
previously , potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium hydroxide , it can also be produced from seawater
however , these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures , potentially forming the explosive superoxide
as a result , pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at 850°c
although sodium is less reactive than potassium , this process works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and can easily be distilled off , so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion
metals like sodium are obtained by electrolysis of molten salts
rb cs obtained mainly as by products of li processing
to make pure cesium , ores of cesium and rubidium are crushed and heated to 650°c with sodium metal , generating an alloy that can then be separated via a fractional distillation technique
because metallic cesium is too reactive to handle , it is normally offered as cesium azide ( csn3 )
cesium hydroxide is formed when cesium interacts aggressively with water and ice ( csoh )
for several years in the 1950s and 1960s , a by - product of the potassium production called alkarb was a main source for rubidium
alkarb contained 21 rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium
the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year
both metals are produced as by - products of lithium production after 1958 , when interest in lithiums thermonuclear properties increased sharply , the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly
as a result of its extreme rarity in nature , the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300 , 000 neutral atoms ,
lithium , sodium , and potassium have many applications , while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts but do not have many applications yet
lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts
sodium compounds have many applications , the most well - known being sodium chloride as table salt
sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap
potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition
potassium hydroxide is a very strong base , and is used to control the ph of various substances
potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate are often used as powerful oxidising agents
rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks
for that reason , caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second
and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry
francium has no commercial applications , studies on the light emitted by laser - trapped francium - 210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels , similar to those predicted by quantum theory
pure alkali metals are dangerously reactive with air and water and must be kept away from heat , fire , oxidising agents , acids , most organic compounds , halocarbons , plastics , and moisture
they also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride , so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires
some class d dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective , depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal
experiments are usually conducted using only small quantities of a few grams in a fume hood
small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water , but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol
rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air , even under oil , because even a small amount of air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide ; for the same reason , potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen - containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months
solid state crystal structures have been determined for many complexes of alkali metal ions in small peptides , nucleic acid constituents , carbohydrates and ionophore complexes
lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role , but does have effects on the body when ingested
lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder ( manic - depression ) in daily doses of about 0 to 2grams , although there are side - effects
excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness , slurred speech and vomiting , among other symptoms , and poisons the central nervous system , which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic dosage

sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems , generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells
sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume , blood pressure , osmotic equilibrium and ph ; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500milligrams per day
the dietary reference intake for sodium is 1grams per day , the minimum amount that promotes hypertension ;
potassium is the major cation ( positive ion ) inside animal cells , biological information publisherwebelements lastwinterfirstmark access - date13 january 2012 sodium the concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells , known as the membrane potential
the balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion transporter proteins in the cell membrane
potassium chloride is used in the united states for lethal injection executions
due to their similar atomic radii , rubidium and caesium in the body mimic potassium and are taken up similarly
rubidium has no known biological role , but may help stimulate metabolism , biological information urlhttp / / www

html lastwinterfirstmark access - date15 february 2011 rats can survive up to 50 substitution of potassium by rubidium
caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people , but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic
like rubidium , caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body , but is significantly larger and is therefore a poorer substitute
biological information publisherwebelements lastwinterfirstmark access - date13 january 2012 but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources
caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy ,
radioisotopes of caesium require special precautions the improper handling of caesium - 137 gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries
perhaps the best - known case is the goiânia accident of 1987 , in which an improperly - disposed - of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of goiânia , brazil , was scavenged from a junkyard , and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious , uneducated buyers
this led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure
together with caesium - 134 , iodine - 131 , and strontium - 90 , caesium - 137 was among the isotopes distributed by the chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health
radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half - life , but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk
an alphabet is a standardized set of basic written symbols or graphemes ( called letters ) that represent the phonemes of certain spoken languages
the first fully phonemic script , the proto - canaanite script , later known as the phoenician alphabet , is considered to be the first alphabet and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets , including arabic , cyrillic , greek , hebrew , latin , and possibly brahmic
which was developed on the basis of the earlier phoenician alphabet
alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters
this makes them useful for purposes of collation , specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order
it also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of numbering ordered items , in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements
the english word alphabet came into middle english from the late latin word alphabetum , which in turn originated in the greek ἀλφάβητος ( alphabētos )
the greek word was made from the first two letters , alpha ( α ) and beta ( β )
the names for the greek letters came from the first two letters of the phoenician alphabet ; aleph , which also meant ox , and bet , which also meant house
sometimes , like in the alphabet song in english , the term abcs is used instead of the word alphabet ( now i know my abcs )
knowing ones abcs , in general , can be used as a metaphor for knowing the basics about anything
the history of the alphabet started in ancient egypt
egyptian writing had a set of some 24 hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals ,
in the middle bronze age , an apparently alphabetic system known as the proto - sinaitic script appears in egyptian turquoise mines in the sinai peninsula dated to circa the 15th century bc , apparently left by canaanite workers
in 1999 , john and deborah darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at wadi el - hol dated to circa 1800 bc and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 bc , strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time
this script had no characters representing vowels , although originally it probably was a syllabary , but unneeded symbols were discarded
an alphabetic cuneiform script with 30 signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in ugarit before the 15th century bc
this script was not used after the destruction of ugarit
the proto - sinaitic script eventually developed into the phoenician alphabet , which is conventionally called proto - canaanite before c
the oldest text in phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of king ahiram
this script is the parent script of all western alphabets
by the tenth century , two other forms can be distinguished , namely canaanite and aramaic
the aramaic gave rise to the hebrew script
the proto - sinaitic or proto - canaanite script and the ugaritic script were the first scripts with a limited number of signs , in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time , cuneiform , egyptian hieroglyphs , and linear the phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters , making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn
another advantage of phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages , since it recorded words phonemically
the script was spread by the phoenicians across the mediterranean
in greece , the script was modified to add vowels , giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the west
it was the first alphabet in which vowels have independent letter forms separate from those of consonants
the greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in greek to represent vowels
vowels are significant in the greek language , and the syllabical linear b script that was used by the mycenaean greeks from the 16th century bc had 87 symbols , including 5 vowels
in its early years , there were many variants of the greek alphabet , a situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it
the greek alphabet , in its euboean form , was carried over by greek colonists to the italian peninsula , where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the italic languages
one of these became the latin alphabet , which was spread across europe as the romans expanded their empire
even after the fall of the roman state , the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works
it eventually became used for the descendant languages of latin ( the romance languages ) and then for most of the other languages of western and central europe
some adaptations of the latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures , such as æ in danish and icelandic and ȣ in algonquian ; by borrowings from other alphabets , such as the thorn þ in old english and icelandic , which came from the futhark runes ; and by modifying existing letters , such as the eth ð of old english and icelandic , which is a modified d
other alphabets only use a subset of the latin alphabet , such as hawaiian , and italian , which uses the letters j , k , x , y and w only in foreign words
another notable script is elder futhark , which is believed to have evolved out of one of the old italic alphabets
elder futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the runic alphabets
the runic alphabets were used for germanic languages from ad 100 to the late middle ages
its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry , although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood
these alphabets have since been replaced with the latin alphabet , except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century
the old hungarian script is a contemporary writing system of the hungarians
it was in use during the entire history of hungary , albeit not as an official writing system
from the 19th century it once again became more and more popular
the glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgical language old church slavonic and became , together with the greek uncial script , the basis of the cyrillic script
cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts , and is notable for its use in slavic languages and also for other languages within the former soviet union
cyrillic alphabets include the serbian , macedonian , bulgarian , russian , belarusian and ukrainian
the glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by saints cyril and methodius , while the cyrillic alphabet was invented by clement of ohrid , who was their disciple
they feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by greek and hebrew
beyond the logographic chinese writing , many phonetic scripts are in existence in asia
the arabic alphabet , hebrew alphabet , syriac alphabet , and other abjads of the middle east are developments of the aramaic alphabet
most alphabetic scripts of india and eastern asia are descended from the brahmi script , which is often believed to be a descendant of aramaic
in korea , the hangul alphabet was created by sejong the great
hangul is a unique alphabet it is a featural alphabet , where many of the letters are designed from a sounds place of articulation ( p to look like the widened mouth , l to look like the tongue pulled in , etcetera ) ; its design was planned by the government of the day ; and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions , in the same way as chinese characters , to allow for mixed - script writing ( one syllable always takes up one type - space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound - block )
zhuyin ( sometimes called bopomofo ) is a semi - syllabary used to phonetically transcribe mandarin chinese in the republic of china
after the later establishment of the peoples republic of china and its adoption of hanyu pinyin , the use of zhuyin today is limited , but it is still widely used in taiwan where the republic of china still governs
zhuyin developed out of a form of chinese shorthand based on chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary
like an alphabet the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual symbols , but like a syllabary the phonemes of the syllable finals are not ; rather , each possible final ( excluding the medial glide ) is represented by its own symbol
for example , luan is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ ( l - u - an ) , where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final - an
while zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system , it is still often used in ways similar to a romanization system—that is , for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for chinese characters on computers and cellphones
european alphabets , especially latin and cyrillic , have been adapted for many languages of asia
arabic is also widely used , sometimes as an abjad ( as with urdu and persian ) and sometimes as a complete alphabet ( as with kurdish and uyghur )
the term alphabet is used by linguists and paleographers in both a wide and a narrow sense
in the wider sense , an alphabet is a script that is segmental at the phoneme level—that is , it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words
in the narrower sense , some scholars distinguish true alphabets from two other types of segmental script , abjads and abugidas
these three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed ; abugidas are also consonant - based but indicate vowels with diacritics to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants
in alphabets in the narrow sense , on the other hand , consonants and vowels are written as independent letters
the earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the wadi el - hol script , believed to be an abjad , which through its successor phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets , including arabic , greek , latin ( via the old italic alphabet ) , cyrillic ( via the greek alphabet ) and hebrew ( via aramaic )
examples of present - day abjads are the arabic and hebrew scripts ; true alphabets include latin , cyrillic , and korean hangul ; and abugidas are used to write tigrinya , amharic , hindi , and thai
the canadian aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply , since each glyph stands for a consonant that is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel
( in a true syllabary , each consonant - vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph
all three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs
ugaritic , for example , is basically an abjad but has syllabic letters for ( я , е , ю ) ; coptic has a letter for
devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels , though some traditions use अ as a zero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels
the boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear - cut
for example , sorani kurdish is written in the arabic script , which is normally an abjad
however , in kurdish , writing the vowels is mandatory , and full letters are used , so the script is a true alphabet
other languages may use a semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics , effectively making them abugidas
on the other hand , the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan abugida , but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks
although short a was not written , as in the indic abugidas , one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet
conversely , the vowel marks of the tigrinya abugida and the amharic abugida ( ironically , the original source of the term abugida ) have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script
even more extreme , the pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic
thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels
for tonal languages , further classification can be based on their treatment of tone , though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types
some alphabets disregard tone entirely , especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load , as in somali and many other languages of africa and the americas
such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels
most commonly , tones are indicated with diacritics , the way vowels are treated in abugidas
this is the case for vietnamese ( a true alphabet ) and thai ( an abugida )
in thai , tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant , with diacritics for disambiguation
in the pollard script , an abugida , vowels are indicated by diacritics , but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone
more rarely , a script may have separate letters for tones , as is the case for hmong and zhuang
for most of these scripts , regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used , the most common tone is not marked , just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic abugidas ; in zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked , but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone , like the virama of indic
the number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small
the book pahlavi script , an abjad , had only twelve letters at one point , and may have had even fewer later on
today the rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters
( the hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small , but it actually consists of 18 letters , including the ʻokina and five long vowels
however , hawaiian braille has only 13 letters
) while rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent ( just eleven ) , book pahlavi was small because many letters had been conflated—that is , the graphic distinctions had been lost over time , and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in arabic , another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes
for example , a comma - shaped letter represented g , d , y , k , or j
however , such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated
in later pahlavi papyri , up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost , and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all , but instead each word had to be learned as a whole—that is , they had become logograms as in egyptian demotic
the largest segmental script is probably an abugida , devanagari
when written in devanagari , vedic sanskrit has an alphabet of 53 letters , including the visarga mark for final aspiration and special letters for kš and jñ , though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used
the hindi alphabet must represent both sanskrit and modern vocabulary , and so has been expanded to 58 with the khutma letters ( letters with a dot added ) to represent sounds from persian and english
thai has a total of 59 symbols , consisting of 44 consonants , 13 vowels and 2 syllabics , not including 4 diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length
the largest known abjad is sindhi , with 51 letters
the largest alphabets in the narrow sense include kabardian and abkhaz ( for cyrillic ) , with 58 and 56 letters , respectively , and slovak ( for the latin script ) , with 46
however , these scripts either count di - and tri - graphs as separate letters , as spanish did with ch and ll until recently , or uses diacritics like slovak č
the georgian alphabet ( ) is an alphabetic writing system
with 33 letters , it is the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent
scholars are against this theory
most scholars link the creation of the georgian script to the process of christianization of iberia , a core georgian kingdom of kartli
syllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs , and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands
thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script
the armenian alphabet ( or ) is a graphically unique alphabetical writing system that has been used to write the armenian language
it was created in year 405 originally contained 36 letters
two more letters , օ ( o ) and ֆ ( f ) , were added in the middle ages
during the 1920s orthography reform , a new letter և ( capital եվ ) was added , which was a ligature before եւ , while the letter ւ ւ was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter ու ու ( which was a digraph before )
the armenian scripts directionality is horizontal left - to - right , like the latin and greek alphabets
) , named after the first two letters of the armenian alphabet ա այբ ayb and բ բեն ben
alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters , which can then be used for purposes of collation—namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called alphabetical order
z ) , which is derived from the northwest semitic abgad order , is well established , although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters ( such as the french é , à , and ô ) and of certain combinations of letters ( multigraphs )
in french , these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation
however , in icelandic , the accented letters such as á , í , and ö are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from the sounds represented by their unaccented counterparts
in spanish , ñ is considered a separate letter , but accented vowels such as á and é are not
the ll and ch were also considered single letters , but in 1994 the real academia española changed the collating order so that ll is between lk and lm in the dictionary and ch is between cg and ci , and in 2010 the tenth congress of the association of spanish language academies changed it so they were no longer letters at all
in german , words starting with sch - ( which spells the german phoneme ) are inserted between words with initial sca - and sci - ( all incidentally loanwords ) instead of appearing after initial sz , as though it were a single letter—in contrast to several languages such as albanian , in which dh - , ë - , gj - , ll - , rr - , th - , xh - and zh - ( all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters ) would follow the letters d , e , g , l , n , r , t , x and z respectively , as well as hungarian and welsh
further , german words with an umlaut are collated ignoring the umlaut—contrary to turkish that adopted the graphemes ö and ü , and where a word like tüfek , would come after tuz , in the dictionary
an exception is the german telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like ä ae since names such as jäger also appear with the spelling jaeger , and are not distinguished in the spoken language
the danish and norwegian alphabets end with æ—ø—å , whereas the swedish and finnish ones conventionally put å—ä—ö at the end
it is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence
some alphabets today , such as the hanunoo script , are learned one letter at a time , in no particular order , and are not used for collation where a definite order is required
however , a dozen ugaritic tablets from the fourteenth century bc preserve the alphabet in two sequences
one , the abcde order later used in phoenician , has continued with minor changes in hebrew , greek , armenian , gothic , cyrillic , and latin ; the other , hmħlq , was used in southern arabia and is preserved today in ethiopic
both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years
runic used an unrelated futhark sequence , which was later simplified
arabic uses its own sequence , although arabic retains the traditional abjadi order for numbering
the brahmic family of alphabets used in india use a unique order based on phonology the letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth
this organization is used in southeast asia , tibet , korean hangul , and even japanese kana , which is not an alphabet
the phoenician letter names , in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound ( acrophony ) , continue to be used to varying degrees in samaritan , aramaic , syriac , hebrew , greek and arabic
the names were abandoned in latin , which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel ( usually e ) before or after the consonant ; the two exceptions were y and z , which were borrowed from the greek alphabet rather than etruscan , and were known as y graeca greek y ( pronounced i graeca greek i ) and zeta ( from greek ) —this discrepancy was inherited by many european languages , as in the term zed for z in all forms of english other than american english
over time names sometimes shifted or were added , as in double u for w ( double v in french ) , the english name for y , and american zee for comparing names in english and french gives a clear reflection of the great vowel shift a , b , c and d are pronounced
the french names ( from which the english names are derived ) preserve the qualities of the english vowels from before the great vowel shift
by contrast , the names of f , l , m , n and s remain the same in both languages , because short vowels were largely unaffected by the shift
in cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on slavic words ; this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in latin
when an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language , an orthography generally comes into being , providing rules for the spelling of words in that language
in accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based , these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the phonemes ( significant sounds ) of the spoken language
in a perfectly phonemic orthography there would be a consistent one - to - one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes , so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation , and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling , and vice versa
however , this ideal is not usually achieved in practice ; some languages ( such as spanish and finnish ) come close to it , while others ( such as english ) deviate from it to a much larger degree
the pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system , and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for , so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language
languages may fail to achieve a one - to - one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways
national languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard
some national languages like finnish , armenian , turkish , russian , serbo - croatian ( serbian , croatian and bosnian ) and bulgarian have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one - to - one correspondence between letters and phonemes
strictly speaking , these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb to spell ( meaning to split a word into its letters ) , the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables
similarly , the italian verb corresponding to spell ( out ) , compitare , is unknown to many italians because spelling is usually trivial , as italian spelling is highly phonemic
in standard spanish , one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling , but not vice versa , as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way , but a given letter is consistently pronounced
french , with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision , may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation , but its rules on pronunciation , though complex , are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy
at the other extreme are languages such as english , where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in a consistent way
for english , this is partly because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography was established , and because english has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times , retaining their original spelling at varying levels
even english has general , albeit complex , rules that predict pronunciation from spelling , and these rules are successful most of the time ; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate
sometimes , countries have the written language undergo a spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language
these can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself , as when turkey switched from the arabic alphabet to a latin - based turkish alphabet , and as when kazakh changes from an arabic script to a cyrillic script due to the soviet unions influence , and in 2021 , having a transition to the latin alphabet , just like turkish
the cyrillic script used to be official in uzbekistan and turkmenistan before they all switched to the latin alphabets , including uzbekistan that is having a reform of the alphabet to use diacritics on the letters that is marked by apostrophes and the letters that are digraphs
the standard system of symbols used by linguists to represent sounds in any language , independently of orthography , is called the international phonetic alphabet
the atomic number or nuclear charge number ( symbol z ) of a chemical element is the charge number of an atomic nucleus
for ordinary nuclei , this is equal to the proton number ( np ) or the number of protons found in the nucleus for every atom of that element
the atomic number can be used to uniquely identify ordinary chemical elements
in an ordinary uncharged atom , the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons
for an ordinary atom , the sum of the atomic number z and the neutron number n gives the atomic mass number a for the atom
since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass ( and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes ) and the mass defect of the nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass , the atomic mass of any atom , when expressed in unified atomic mass units ( making a quantity called the relative isotopic mass ) , is within 1 of the whole number
atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers , and hence different mass numbers , are known as isotopes
a little more than three - quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes ( see monoisotopic elements ) , and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element ( called the relative atomic mass ) in a defined environment on earth , determines the elements standard atomic weight
historically , it was these atomic weights of elements ( in comparison to hydrogen ) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century
the conventional symbol z comes from the german word ( and its english equivalent atomic number ) come into common use in this context
loosely speaking , the existence or construction of a periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements , and so they can be numbered in order
dmitri mendeleev claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables ( first published on march 6 , 1869 ) in order of atomic weight ( atomgewicht )
https / / history
org / exhibits / curie / periodic
htm the periodic table of elements , american institute of physics however , in consideration of the elements observed chemical properties , he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium ( atomic weight 127 ) ahead of iodine ( atomic weight 126 )
this placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number , z , but that number was not known or suspected at the time
a simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory , however
besides the case of iodine and tellurium , later several other pairs of elements ( such as argon and potassium , cobalt and nickel ) were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights , thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties
however the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar lanthanide elements , whose atomic number was not obvious , led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from lutetium ( element 71 ) onward ( hafnium was not known at this time )
in 1911 , ernest rutherford gave a model of the atom in which a central nucleus held most of the atoms mass and a positive charge which , in units of the electrons charge , was to be approximately equal to half of the atoms atomic weight , expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms this central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight ( though it was almost 25 different from the atomic number of gold ) , the single element from which rutherford made his guess )
nevertheless , in spite of rutherfords estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 ( but was element on the periodic table ) , a month after rutherfords paper appeared , antonius van den broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was exactly equal to its place in the periodic table ( also known as element number , atomic number , and symbolized z )
this proved eventually to be the case
the experimental position improved dramatically after research by henry moseley in 1913
moseley , after discussions with bohr who was at the same lab ( and who had used van den broeks hypothesis in his bohr model of the atom ) , decided to test van den broeks and bohrs hypothesis directly , by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the bohr theorys postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of
to do this , moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions ( k and l lines ) produced by the elements from aluminum ( z13 ) to gold ( z79 ) used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an x - ray tube
increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression
this led to the conclusion ( moseleys law ) that the atomic number does closely correspond ( with an offset of one unit for k - lines , in moseleys work ) to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus , that is the element number among other things , moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series ( from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive ) must have 15 members—no fewer and no more—which was far from obvious from known chemistry at that time
after moseleys death in 1915 , the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium ( z92 ) were examined by his method
there were seven elements ( with zlt ; 92 ) which were not found and therefore identified as still undiscovered , corresponding to atomic numbers 43 , 61 , 72 , 75 , 85 , 87 and 91
from 1918 to 1947 , all seven of these missing elements were discovered
by this time , the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered , so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium ( z96 )
in 1915 , the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of z , which were now recognized to be the same as the element number , was not understood
an old idea called prouts hypothesis had postulated that the elements were all made of residues ( or protyles ) of the lightest element hydrogen , which in the bohr - rutherford model had a single electron and a nuclear charge of one
however , as early as 1907 , rutherford and thomas royds had shown that alpha particles , which had a charge of 2 , were the nuclei of helium atoms , which had a mass four times that of hydrogen , not two times
if prouts hypothesis were true , something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms
in 1917 , rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a nuclear reaction between alpha particles and nitrogen gas , and believed he had proven prouts law
he called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in 1920 ( alternate names being proutons and protyles )
it had been immediately apparent from the work of moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of hydrogen nuclei , and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra protons presumed present in all heavy nuclei
a helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two nuclear electrons ( electrons bound inside the nucleus ) to cancel two of the charges
at the other end of the periodic table , a nucleus of gold with a mass 197 times that of hydrogen was thought to contain 118nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it a residual charge of 79 , consistent with its atomic number
all consideration of nuclear electrons ended with james chadwicks discovery of the neutron in 1932
an atom of gold now was seen as containing 118 neutrons rather than 118 nuclear electrons , and its positive nuclear charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of 79protons
since moseley had previously shown that the atomic number z of an element equals this positive charge , it was now clear that z is identical to the number of protons of its nuclei
each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom , which is z ( the atomic number )
the configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics
the number of electrons in each elements electron shells , particularly the outermost valence shell , is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior
hence , it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element ; and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of any mixture of atoms with a given atomic number
the quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers
as of though undiscovered nuclides with certain magic numbers of protons and neutrons may have relatively longer half - lives and comprise an island of stability
a hypothetical element composed only of neutrons has also been proposed and would have atomic number 0
anatomy dissection anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things
it is an old science , having its beginnings in prehistoric times
as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated , both over immediate and long - term timescales
anatomy and physiology , which study the structure and function of organisms and their parts respectively , make a natural pair of related disciplines , and are often studied together
human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied in medicine
the discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic
macroscopic anatomy , or gross anatomy , is the examination of an animals body parts using unaided eyesight
gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy
microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures , known as histology , and also in the study of cells
the history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body
methods have also improved dramatically , advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers ( corpses ) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including x - ray , ultrasound , and magnetic resonance imaging
derived from the greek anatémnō i cut up , cut open from ἀνά aná up , and τέμνω témnō i cut ) , anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems , organs and tissues
it includes the appearance and position of the various parts , the materials from which they are composed , their locations and their relationships with other parts
anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry , which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved
for example , an anatomist is concerned with the shape , size , position , structure , blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver ; while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile , the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions
the discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy
gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye , and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy , the study by sight of the external body features
microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale , along with histology ( the study of tissues ) , and embryology ( the study of an organism in its immature condition )
anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non - invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems methods used include dissection , in which a body is opened and its organs studied , and endoscopy , in which a video camera - equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures
angiography using x - rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels
the term anatomy is commonly taken to refer to human anatomy
however , substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals
the term zootomy is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non - human animals
the structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy
the kingdom animalia contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motile ( although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle )
most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans
they have an internal digestive chamber , with one or two openings ; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs , and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development
metazoans do not include the sponges , which have undifferentiated cells
unlike plant cells , animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts
vacuoles , when present , are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell
the body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell , including those found in muscles , nerves and skin
each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids , cytoplasm and a nucleus
all of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers
those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic
all of a triploblastic animals tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo , the ectoderm , mesoderm and endoderm
animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types connective , epithelial , muscle and nervous tissue
connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix
connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place
the main types are loose connective tissue , adipose tissue , fibrous connective tissue , cartilage and bone
the extracellular matrix contains proteins , the chief and most abundant of which is collagen
collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues
the matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body
an exoskeleton is a thickened , rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization , as in crustaceans or by the cross - linking of its proteins as in insects
an endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals , as well as in many of those less developed
epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells , bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules , with little intercellular space
epithelial cells can be squamous ( flat ) , cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina , the upper layer of the basement membrane , there are many different types of epithelium , modified to suit a particular function
in the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining ; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi
skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body
keratinocytes make up to 95 of the cells in the skin
muscle cells ( myocytes ) form the active contractile tissue of the body
muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion , either locomotion or movement within internal organs
muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types ; smooth muscle , skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle
smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically
it contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths
it is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers
skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension
it is found in the movement of appendages and jaws
obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two
the filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions
in higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets
smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus , bladder , intestines , stomach , oesophagus , respiratory airways , and blood vessels
cardiac muscle is found only in the heart , allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body
nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information
in some slow - moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians ( including sea anemones and jellyfish ) , the nerves form a nerve net , but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles
in simple animals , receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus
in more complex animals , specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism
neurons can be connected together in ganglia
all vertebrates have a similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives , mostly in the embryonic stage , share the major chordate characteristics ; a stiffening rod , the notochord ; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material , the neural tube ; pharyngeal arches ; and a tail posterior to the anus
the spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it
the defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column , formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae
in most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs
however , a few vertebrates , such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood
the body of a fish is divided into a head , trunk and tail , although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible
the skeleton , which forms the support structure inside the fish , is either made of cartilage , in cartilaginous fish , or bone in bony fish
the main skeletal element is the vertebral column , composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong
the ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles
the main external features of the fish , the fins , are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays , which with the exception of the caudal fins , have no direct connection with the spine
they are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk
the heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop
sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish , including skeletons composed of cartilage
their bodies tend to be dorso - ventrally flattened , they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head
the dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales
they have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open , but not a swim bladder
cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large , yolky eggs
some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases
the bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits , often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish
they have a bony skeleton , are generally laterally flattened , have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum , and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout
the dermis is covered with overlapping scales
bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column , but not a cloaca
they mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column
amphibians are a class of animals comprising frogs , salamanders and caecilians
they are tetrapods , but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size
their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes
their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae
their skulls are mostly broad and short , and are often incompletely ossified
their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales , but contains many mucous glands and in some species , poison glands
the hearts of amphibians have three chambers , two atria and one ventricle
they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea
amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping , a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils
these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat
in frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs
the feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing
frogs have large eyes and no tail
salamanders resemble lizards in appearance ; their short legs project sideways , the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail
caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless
they burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side
reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles , tuataras , lizards , snakes and crocodiles
they are tetrapods , but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size
their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians
the teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size
the surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer
reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls
the heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams the reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization , with a copulatory organ present in most species
the eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land , or develop internally in some species
the bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid
turtles are notable for their protective shells
they have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below
these are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine
the neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell
turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp , horny plates
in aquatic species , the front legs are modified into flippers
tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the triassic period
there is one living species , sphenodon punctatus
the skull has two openings ( fenestrae ) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull
there is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews
the teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down
the brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles , and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi
the tuatara has a well - developed parietal eye on its forehead
lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side , the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost
this results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider
lizards are mostly quadrupeds , with the trunk held off the ground by short , sideways - facing legs , but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes
lizards have moveable eyelids , eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye
snakes are closely related to lizards , having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the cretaceous period , and they share many of the same features
the skeleton consists of a skull , a hyoid bone , spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs
the bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole
snakes lack moveable eyelids , the eyes being covered by transparent spectacle scales
they do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull
their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm - blooded prey
crocodilians are large , low - slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth
the head and trunk are dorso - ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed
it undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming
the tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull
the nostrils , eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating
valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged
unlike other reptiles , crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood
birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping , their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight
birds are endothermic , have a high metabolic rate , a light skeletal system and powerful muscles
the long bones are thin , hollow and very light
air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones
the sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused
there are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn - covered beak
the eyes are relatively large , particularly in nocturnal species such as owls
they face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks
the feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin
large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail , contour feathers cover the birds surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds
the only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail
this produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens
there are scales on the legs , feet and claws on the tips of the toes
mammals are a diverse class of animals , mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight
they mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings
the legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk , which is held well clear of the ground
the bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth , which are usually differentiated , are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel
the teeth are shed once ( milk teeth ) during the animals lifetime or not at all , as is the case in cetaceans
mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear
they are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat
some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands , producing milk to feed the young
mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs
the mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate
nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea
mammals are amniotes , and most are viviparous , giving birth to live young
the exception to this are the egg - laying monotremes , the platypus and the echidnas of australia
most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment , but in marsupials , the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mothers pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development
humans have the overall body plan of a mammal
humans have a head , neck , trunk ( which includes the thorax and abdomen ) , two arms and hands , and two legs and feet
generally , students of certain biological sciences , paramedics , prosthetists and orthotists , physiotherapists , occupational therapists , nurses , podiatrists , and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models , skeletons , textbooks , diagrams , photographs , lectures and tutorials and in addition , medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers
the study of microscopic anatomy ( or histology ) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations ( or slides ) under a microscope
human anatomy , physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences , which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school
human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically ; that is , respectively , studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest , or studying by specific systems , such as the nervous or respiratory systems the major anatomy textbook , grays anatomy , has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format , in line with modern teaching methods
a thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians , especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties , such as histopathology and radiology
academic anatomists are usually employed by universities , medical schools or teaching hospitals
they are often involved in teaching anatomy , and research into certain systems , organs , tissues or cells
invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus , lobster and dragonfly
they constitute about 95 of the animal species
by definition , none of these creatures has a backbone
the cells of single - cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs
locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia , food may be gathered by phagocytosis , energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton
some protozoans can form multicellular colonies
metazoans are a multicellular organism , with different groups of cells serving different functions
the most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue , both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates
the outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism
an endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms , sponges and some cephalopods
exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods ( insects , spiders , ticks , shrimps , crabs , lobsters )
calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs , brachiopods and some tube - building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria
marcello malpighi , the father of microscopical anatomy , discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm
he observed that when a ring - like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring , and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves , and being captured above the ring
arthropods comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species
insects possess segmented bodies supported by a hard - jointed outer covering , the exoskeleton , made mostly of chitin
the segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts , a head , a thorax and an abdomen
there is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts , especially wings , legs , antennae and mouthparts
spiders a class of arachnids have four pairs of legs ; a body of two segments—a cephalothorax and an abdomen
spiders have no wings and no antennae
they have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous
they have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax
these have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs
at the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon - shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ
in 1600 bce , the edwin smith papyrus , an ancient egyptian medical text , described the heart , its vessels , liver , spleen , kidneys , hypothalamus , uterus and bladder , and showed the blood vessels diverging from the heart
the ebers papyrus ( c
1550 bce ) features a treatise on the heart , with vessels carrying all the bodys fluids to or from every member of the body
ancient greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world
over time , this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body
phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made , which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain , eye , liver , reproductive organs and the nervous system
the hellenistic egyptian city of alexandria was the stepping - stone for greek anatomy and physiology
alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the greeks , but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers
great patronage of the arts and sciences from the ptolemy rulers helped raise alexandria up , further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other greek states
some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in hellenistic alexandria
two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were herophilus and erasistratus
these two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research
they also conducted vivisections on the cadavers of condemned criminals , which was considered taboo until the renaissance—herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections
some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse , the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls than veins , and that the atria were parts of the heart
herophiluss knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain , eye , liver , reproductive organs and nervous system , and characterizing the course of disease
during his study in alexandria , erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems he was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart , which was then carried throughout the body
his distinction between the arteries and veins—the arteries carrying the air through the body , while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery
erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart , including the tricuspid
and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses
it was herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis
herophilus is also credited with describing the optic , oculomotor , motor division of the trigeminal , facial , vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves
great feats were made during the third century bce in both the digestive and reproductive systems herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands , but the small intestine and liver
he showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes
he recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland
the anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the hippocratic corpus , an ancient greek medical work written by unknown authors
in the 2nd century , galen of pergamum , an anatomist , clinician , writer and philosopher , wrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of ancient times
he was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals
galens drawings , based mostly on dog anatomy , became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years
his work was known to renaissance doctors only through islamic golden age medicine until it was translated from the greek some time in the 15th century
anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century ; as the historian marie boas writes , progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid
between 1275 and 1326 , the anatomists mondino de luzzi , alessandro achillini and antonio benivieni at bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times
mondinos anatomy of 1316 was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy
it describes the body in the order followed in mondinos dissections , starting with the abdomen , then the thorax , then the head and limbs
it was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century
leonardo da vinci ( 1452–1519 ) was trained in anatomy by andrea del verrocchio
he made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork , making many sketches of skeletal structures , muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected
andreas vesalius ( 1514–1564 ) , professor of anatomy at the university of padua , is considered the founder of modern human anatomy
originally from brabant , vesalius published the influential book de humani corporis fabrica ( the structure of the human body ) , a large format book in seven volumes , in 1543
the accurate and intricately detailed illustrations , often in allegorical poses against italianate landscapes , are thought to have been made by the artist jan van calcar , a pupil of titian
in england , anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science ; these were given by the company of barbers and surgeons in the 16th century , joined in 1583 by the lumleian lectures in surgery at the royal college of physicians
in the united states , medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century
classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain
philadelphia , baltimore and new york were all renowned for body snatching activity as criminals raided graveyards at night , removing newly buried corpses from their coffins
the teaching of anatomy in britain was transformed by sir john struthers , regius professor of anatomy at the university of aberdeen from 1863 to 1889
he was responsible for setting up the system of three years of pre - clinical academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine , including especially anatomy
this system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003
as well as teaching , he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy , published over 70 research papers , and became famous for his public dissection of the tay whale
from 1822 the royal college of surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools
ignaz semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused
he noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives
the students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth
semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination , the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically
before the modern medical era , the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were dissection of the dead and inspection , palpation and auscultation of the living
it was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues
technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839 , matthias jakob schleiden and theodor schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things
study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine
staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue
advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens
the invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them
about the same time , in the 1950s , the use of x - ray diffraction for studying the crystal structures of proteins , nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy
equally important advances have occurred in non - invasive techniques for examining the interior structures of the body
x - rays can be passed through the body and used in medical radiography and fluoroscopy to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness
magnetic resonance imaging , computed tomography , and ultrasound imaging have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations
affirming the consequent , sometimes called converse error , fallacy of the converse , or confusion of necessity and sufficiency , is a formal fallacy of taking a true conditional statement ( for example , if the lamp were broken , then the room would be dark ) , and invalidly inferring its converse ( the room is dark , so the lamp is broken ) , even though that statement may not be true
this arises when a consequent ( the room would be dark ) has other possible antecedents seen as less likely ( for example , the lamp is not plugged in or the lamp is in working order , but is switched off )
converse errors are common in everyday thinking and communication and can result from , among other causes , communication issues , misconceptions about logic , and failure to consider other causes
the opposite statement , denying the consequent , is a valid form of argument
denying the consequent can be considered a form of abductive reasoning
affirming the consequent is the action of taking a true statement p to q and invalidly concluding its converse q to the name affirming the consequent derives from using the consequent , q , of p to q , to conclude the antecedent this illogic can be summarized formally as ( p to q , q ) to p or , alternatively , fracp to q , qtherefore
the root cause of such a logic error is sometimes failure to realize that just because p is a possible condition for q , p may not be the only condition for q , that is q may follow from another condition as well
affirming the consequent can also result from overgeneralizing the experience of many statements having true converses
if p and q are equivalent statements , that is p leftrightarrow q , it is possible to infer p under the condition for example , the statements it is august 13 , so it is my birthday p to q and it is my birthday , so it is august 13 q to p are equivalent and both true consequences of the statement august 13 is my birthday ( an abbreviated form of p leftrightarrow q )
using one statement to conclude the other is not an example of affirming the consequent , but some people may misapply the approach
one way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion
for example
there are many ways to live in california without living in san diego , as long as they live in a californian place other than san diego
however , one can affirm with certainty that if someone does not live in california ( non - q ) , then this person does not live in san diego ( non - p )
this is the contrapositive of the first statement , and it must be true if and only if the original statement is true
here , it is immediately intuitive that any number of other antecedents ( if an animal is a deer , if an animal is an elephant , if an animal is a moose , etcetera ) can give rise to the consequent ( then it has four legs ) , and that it is preposterous to suppose that having four legs must imply that the animal is a dog and nothing else
this is useful as a teaching example since most people can immediately recognize that the conclusion reached must be wrong ( intuitively , a cat cannot be a dog ) , and that the method by which it was reached must therefore be fallacious
arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing , as in the following example
being thrown off the top of the eiffel tower is not the only cause of death , since there exist numerous different causes of death
affirming the consequent is commonly used in rationalization , and thus appears as a coping mechanism in some people
in catch - 22 , the chaplain is interrogated for supposedly being washington irving / irving washington , who has been blocking out large portions of soldiers letters home
the colonel has found such a letter , but with the chaplains name signed
you can read , though , cant you the colonel persevered sarcastically
the author signed his name
p in this case is the chaplain signs his own name , and q the chaplains name is written
the chaplains name may be written , but he did not necessarily write it , as the colonel falsely concludes
andrei arsenyevich tarkovsky ( / / большая российская энциклопедия
москва , 2016 , с
– 29 december 1986 ) was a soviet film director , screenwriter , and film theorist
he is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential filmmakers in soviet and world cinema
his films explored spiritual and metaphysical themes , and are noted for their slow pacing and long takes , dreamlike visual imagery , and preoccupation with nature and memory
tarkovsky studied film at moscows vgik under filmmaker mikhail romm , and subsequently directed his first five features in the soviet union ivans childhood ( 1962 ) , andrei rublev ( 1966 ) , solaris ( 1972 ) , mirror ( 1975 ) , and stalker ( 1979 )
a number of his films from this period are ranked among the best films ever made
after years of creative conflict with state film authorities , tarkovsky left the country in 1979 and made his final two films abroad ; nostalghia ( 1983 ) and the sacrifice ( 1986 ) were produced in italy and sweden respectively
in 1986 , he also published a book about cinema and art entitled sculpting in time
he died of cancer later that year
there is still debate if it was from cancer or from poison , ordered from the soviet union
tarkovsky was the recipient of several awards at the cannes film festival throughout his career ( including the fipresci prize , the prize of the ecumenical jury , and the grand prix spécial du jury ) and winner of the golden lion award at the venice film festival for his debut film ivans childhood
in 1990 , he was posthumously awarded the soviet unions prestigious lenin prize
three of his films—andrei rublev , mirror , and stalker—featured in sight sounds 2012 poll of the 100 greatest films of all time
andrei tarkovsky was born in the village of zavrazhye in the yuryevetsky district of the ivanovo industrial oblast ( modern - day kadyysky district of the kostroma oblast , russia ) to the poet and translator arseny aleksandrovich tarkovsky , a native of kropyvnytskyi , ukraine , and maria ivanova vishnyakova , a graduate of the maxim gorky literature institute who later worked as a corrector ; she was born in moscow in the dubasov family estate
andreis paternal grandfather aleksandr karlovich tarkovsky ( in interview to the gordon boulevard newspaper at the andrei tarkovsky media archive , 2007 ( in russian ) andreis maternal grandmother vera nikolaevna vishnyakova ( née dubasova ) belonged to an old dubasov family of russian nobility that traces its history back to the 17th century ; among her relatives was admiral fyodor dubasov , a fact she had to conceal during the soviet days
she was married to ivan ivanovich vishnyakov , a native of the kaluga governorate who studied law at the moscow state university and served as a judge in kozelsk
according to the family legend , tarkovskys ancestors on his fathers side were princes from the shamkhalate of tarki , dagestan , although his sister marina tarkovskaya who did a detailed research on their genealogy called it a myth , even a prank of sorts , stressing that none of the documents confirms this version
tarkovsky spent his childhood in yuryevets
tarkovsky stayed with his mother , moving with her and his sister marina to moscow , where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press
in 1939 , tarkovsky enrolled at the moscow school no
during the war , the three evacuated to yuryevets , living with his maternal grandmother
in 1943 , the family returned to moscow
tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school , where the poet andrei voznesensky was one of his classmates
he studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school
the family lived on shchipok street in the zamoskvorechye district in moscow
from november 1947 to spring 1948 he was in the hospital with tuberculosis
many themes of his childhood—the evacuation , his mother and her two children , the withdrawn father , the time in the hospital—feature prominently in his film mirror
in his school years , tarkovsky was a troublemaker and a poor student
he still managed to graduate , and from 1951 to 1952 studied arabic at the oriental institute in moscow , a branch of the academy of sciences of the soviet union
although he already spoke some arabic and was a successful student in his first semesters , he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the academy of science institute for non - ferrous metals and gold
he participated in a year - long research expedition to the river kureyka near turukhansk in the krasnoyarsk province
during this time in the taiga , tarkovsky decided to study film
upon returning from the research expedition in 1954 , tarkovsky applied at the state institute of cinematography ( vgik ) and was admitted to the film - directing program
he was in the same class as irma raush ( irina ) whom he married in april 1957
the early khrushchev era offered good opportunities for young film directors
before 1953 , annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors
after 1953 , more films were produced , many of them by young directors
the khrushchev thaw relaxed soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of european and north american literature , films and music
this allowed tarkovsky to see films of the italian neorealists , french new wave , and of directors such as kurosawa , buñuel , bergman , bresson , wajda ( whose film ashes and diamonds influenced tarkovsky ) and mizoguchi
tarkovskys teacher and mentor was mikhail romm , who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors
in 1956 , tarkovsky directed his first student short film , the killers , from a short story of ernest hemingway
the longer television film there will be no leave today followed in 1959
both films were a collaboration between the vgik students
classmate aleksandr gordon , who married tarkovskys sister , in particular directed , wrote , edited , and acted in the two films with tarkovsky
an important influence on tarkovsky was the film director grigory chukhray , who was teaching at the vgik
impressed by the talent of his student , chukhray offered tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film clear skies
tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects
during his third year at the vgik , tarkovsky met andrei konchalovsky
they found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films in 1959 , they wrote the script antarctica – distant country , which was later published in the moskovsky komsomolets
tarkovsky submitted the script to lenfilm , but it was rejected
they were more successful with the script the steamroller and the violin , which they sold to mosfilm
this became tarkovskys graduation project , earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning first prize at the new york student film festival in 1961
tarkovskys first feature film was ivans childhood in 1962
he had inherited the film from director eduard abalov , who had to abort the project
the film earned tarkovsky international acclaim and won the golden lion award at the venice film festival in the year 1962
in the same year , on 30 september , his first son arseny ( called senka in tarkovskys diaries ) tarkovsky was born
in 1965 , he directed the film andrei rublev about the life of andrei rublev , the fifteenth - century russian icon painter
andrei rublev was not , except for a single screening in moscow in 1966 , immediately released after completion due to problems with soviet authorities
tarkovsky had to cut the film several times , resulting in several different versions of varying lengths
the film was widely released in the soviet union in a cut version in 1971
nevertheless , the film had a budget of more than 1 million rubles – a significant sum for that period
a version of the film was presented at the cannes film festival in 1969 and won the fipresci prize
he divorced his wife , irina , in june 1970
in the same year , he married larisa kizilova ( née egorkina ) , who had been a production assistant for the film andrei rublev ( they had been living together since 1965 )
their son , andrei andreyevich tarkovsky , ( nicknamed andriosha , meaning little andre or andre junior ) was born in the same year on 7 august
in 1972 , he completed solaris , an adaptation of the novel solaris by stanisław lem
he had worked on this together with screenwriter friedrich gorenstein as early as 1968
the film was presented at the cannes film festival , won the grand prix spécial du jury , and was nominated for the palme dor
from 1973 to 1974 , he shot the film mirror , a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his fathers poems in this film tarkovsky portrayed the plight of childhood affected by war
tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967 , under the consecutive titles confession , white day and a white , white day
from the beginning the film was not well received by soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature
soviet authorities placed the film in the third category , a severely limited distribution , and only allowed it to be shown in third - class cinemas and workers clubs
few prints were made and the film - makers received no returns
third category films also placed the film - makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds , which could have serious effects on their future productivity
these difficulties are presumed to have made tarkovsky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the soviet film industry
during 1975 , tarkovsky also worked on the screenplay hoffmanniana , about the german writer and poet hoffmann
in december 1976 , he directed hamlet , his only stage play , at the lenkom theatre in moscow
the main role was played by anatoly solonitsyn , who also acted in several of tarkovskys films at the end of 1978 , he also wrote the screenplay sardor together with the writer aleksandr misharin
the last film tarkovsky completed in the soviet union was stalker , inspired by the novel roadside picnic by the brothers arkady and boris strugatsky
tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986
initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel dead mountaineers hotel and he developed a raw script
influenced by a discussion with arkady strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on roadside picnic
work on this film began in 1976
the production was mired in troubles ; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots
tarkovskys relationship with cinematographer georgy rerberg deteriorated to the point where he hired alexander knyazhinsky as a new first cinematographer
furthermore , tarkovsky had a heart attack in april 1978 , resulting in further delay
the film was completed in 1979 and won the prize of the ecumenical jury at the cannes film festival
in a question and answer session at the edinburgh filmhouse on 11 february 1981 , tarkovsky trenchantly rejected suggestions that the film was either impenetrably mysterious or a political allegory
in 1979 , tarkovsky began production of the film the first day ( russian первый день pervyj dyen ) , based on a script by his friend and long - term collaborator andrei konchalovsky
the film was set in 18th - century russia during the reign of peter the great and starred natalya bondarchuk and anatoli papanov
to get the project approved by goskino , tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script , omitting several scenes that were critical of the official atheism in the soviet union
after shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors
tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film
during the summer of 1979 , tarkovsky traveled to italy , where he shot the documentary voyage in time together with his long - time friend tonino guerra
tarkovsky returned to italy in 1980 for an extended trip , during which he and guerra completed the script for the film nostalghia
during this period , he took polaroid photographs depicting his personal life
tarkovsky returned to italy in 1982 to start shooting nostalghia , but mosfilm then withdrew from the project , so he sought and received financial backing from the italian rai
tarkovsky completed the film in 1983 , and it was presented at the cannes film festival where it won the fipresci prize and the prize of the ecumenical jury
tarkovsky also shared a special prize called grand prix du cinéma de creation with robert bresson
soviet authorities lobbied to prevent the film from winning the palme dor , a fact that hardened tarkovskys resolve to never work in the soviet union again
after cannes he went to london to stage and choreograph the opera boris godunov at the royal opera house under the musical direction of claudio abbado
at a press conference in milan on 10 july 1984 , he announced that he would never return to the soviet union and would remain in western europe
he stated , i am not a soviet dissident , i have no conflict with the soviet government , but if he returned home , he added , i would be unemployed
tarkovsky spent most of 1984 preparing the film the sacrifice
it was finally shot in 1985 in sweden , with many of the crew being alumni from ingmar bergmans films , including cinematographer sven nykvist
tarkovskys vision of his film was greatly influenced by bergmans style
while the sacrifice is about an apocalypse and impending death , faith , and possible redemption , in the making - of documentary directed by andrei tarkovsky , in a particularly poignant scene , writer / director michal leszczylowski follows tarkovsky on a walk as he expresses his sentiments on death—he claims himself to be immortal and has no fear of dying
ironically , at the end of the year tarkovsky was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer
in january 1986 , he began treatment in paris and was joined there by his son , andre jr , who was finally allowed to leave the soviet union
what would be tarkovskys final film was dedicated to him
the sacrifice was presented at the cannes film festival and received the grand prix spécial du jury , the fipresci prize and the prize of the ecumenical jury
as tarkovsky was unable to attend due to his illness , the prizes were collected by his son
in tarkovskys last diary entry ( 15 december 1986 ) , he wrote but now i have no strength left—that is the problem
the diaries are sometimes also known as martyrology and were published posthumously in 1989 and in english in 1991
tarkovsky died in paris on 29 december 1986
his funeral ceremony was held at the alexander nevsky cathedral
he was buried on 3 january 1987 in the russian cemetery in sainte - geneviève - des - bois in france
the inscription on his gravestone , which was erected in 1994 , was conceived by tarkovskys wife , larisa , reads to the man who saw the angel
larisa died in 1998 and is buried beside her husband
a conspiracy theory emerged in russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that tarkovsky did not die of natural causes , but was assassinated by the kgb
evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former kgb agents who claim that viktor chebrikov gave the order to eradicate tarkovsky to curtail what the soviet government and the kgb saw as anti - soviet propaganda by tarkovsky
other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the 1991 coup and the claim by one of tarkovskys doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause
as with tarkovsky , his wife larisa and actor anatoly solonitsyn all died from the very same type of lung cancer
vladimir sharun , sound designer in stalker , is convinced that they were all poisoned by the chemical plant where they were shooting the film
tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s , a period referred to as the khrushchev thaw , during which soviet society opened to foreign films , literature and music , among other things
this allowed tarkovsky to see films of european , american and japanese directors , an experience that influenced his own film making
his teacher and mentor at the film school , mikhail romm , allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director
tarkovsky was , according to fellow student shavkat abdusalmov , fascinated by japanese films he was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight
tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of haiku and its ability to create images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves
tarkovsky was also a deeply religious orthodox christian , who believed great art should have a higher spiritual purpose
he was a perfectionist not given to humor or humility his signature style was ponderous and literary , having many characters that pondered over religious themes and issues regarding faith
tarkovsky perceived that the art of cinema has only been truly mastered by very few filmmakers , stating in a 1970 interview with naum abramov that they can be counted on the fingers of one hand
with the exception of city lights , the list does not contain any films of the early silent era
the reason is that tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon , with the early film - making forming only a prelude
the list has also no films or directors from tarkovskys native russia , although he rated soviet directors such as boris barnet , sergei parajanov and alexander dovzhenko highly
he said of dovzhenkos earth i have lived a lot among very simple farmers and met extraordinary people
they spread calmness , had such tact , they conveyed a feeling of dignity and displayed wisdom that i have seldom come across on such a scale
dovzhenko had obviously understood wherein the sense of life resides
this trespassing of the border between nature and mankind is an ideal place for the existence of man
dovzhenko understood this
andrei tarkovsky was not a fan of science fiction , largely dismissing it for its comic book trappings and vulgar commercialism
however , in a famous exception tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film the terminator , saying that its vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art
he was critical of the brutality and low acting skills , but was nevertheless impressed by the film
in a 1962 interview , tarkovsky argued all art , of course , is intellectual , but for me , all the arts , and cinema even more so , must above all be emotional and act upon the heart
his films are characterized by metaphysical themes , extremely long takes , and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty
recurring motifs are dreams , memory , childhood , running water accompanied by fire , rain indoors , reflections , levitation , and characters re - appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera
he once said juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless , collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away , relating a person to the whole world , that is the meaning of cinema
tarkovsky incorporated levitation scenes into several of his films , most notably solaris
to him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability
bells and candles are also frequent symbols
these are symbols of film , sight and sound , and tarkovskys film frequently has themes of self - reflection
tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called sculpting in time
by this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it
unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time
by using long takes and few cuts in his films , he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing , time lost , and the relationship of one moment in time to another
up to , and including , his film mirror , tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory
after mirror , he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by aristotle a concentrated action , happening in one place , within the span of a single day
several of tarkovskys films have color or black - and - white sequences
this first occurs in the otherwise monochrome andrei rublev , which features a color epilogue of rublevs authentic religious icon paintings
all of his films afterwards contain monochrome , and in stalkers case sepia sequences , while otherwise being in color
in 1966 , in an interview conducted shortly after finishing andrei rublev , tarkovsky dismissed color film as a commercial gimmick and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color
he claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time , and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments , but not all the time , as this distracts the viewer
to him , films in color were like moving paintings or photographs , which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life
contrarily , however , bergman conceded the truth in the claim made by a critic who wrote that with autumn sonata bergman does bergman , adding tarkovsky began to make tarkovsky films , and that fellini began to make fellini films buñuel nearly always made buñuel films this pastiche of ones own work has been derogatorily termed as self - karaoke
tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer vadim yusov from 1958 to 1972 , and much of the visual style of tarkovskys films can be attributed to this collaboration
tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for yusov to film a single long take , and due to the preparation , usually only a single take was needed
the films of andrei tarkovsky a visual fugue by vida johnson , graham petrie , p
in his last film , the sacrifice , tarkovsky worked with cinematographer sven nykvist , who had worked on many films with director ingmar bergman
( nykvist was not alone several people involved in the production had previously collaborated with bergman , notably lead actor erland josephson , who had also acted for tarkovsky in nostalghia
) nykvist complained that tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it , but ultimately stated that choosing to work with tarkovsky was one of the best choices he had ever made
tarkovsky is mainly known as a film director
during his career he directed seven feature films , as well as three shorts from his time at vgik
his features are
he also wrote several screenplays
furthermore , he directed the play hamlet for the stage in moscow , directed the opera boris godunov in london , and he directed a radio production of the short story turnabout by william faulkner
he also wrote sculpting in time , a book on film theory
tarkovskys first feature film was ivans childhood in 1962
he then directed andrei rublev in 1966 , solaris in 1972 , mirror in 1975 and stalker in 1979
the documentary voyage in time was produced in italy in 1982 , as was nostalghia in 1983
his last film the sacrifice was produced in sweden in 1986
tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films , sometimes with a cowriter
tarkovsky once said that a director who realizes somebody elses screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator , resulting in dead and monotonous films
a book of 60 photos , instant light , tarkovsky polaroids , taken by tarkovsky in russia and italy between 1979 and 1984 was published in 2006
the collection was selected by italian photographer giovanni chiaramonte and tarkovskys son andrey tarkovsky
concentrate ( its about the leader of a geological expedition , who waits for the boat that brings back the concentrates collected by the expedition
the expedition is surrounded by mystery , and its purpose is a state secret
although some authors claim that the screenplay was filmed , according to marina tarkovskaya , tarkovskys sister ( and wife of aleksandr gordon , a fellow student of tarkovsky during his film school years ) the screenplay was never filmed
tarkovsky wrote the screenplay during his entrance examination at the state institute of cinematography ( vgik ) in a single sitting
he earned the highest possible grade , excellent (
although the script was well received by the officials at tallinnfilm , it was the consensus that no one but tarkovsky would be able to direct it
the script was sent to goskino in february 1976 , and although approval was granted for proceeding with making the film , the screenplay was never realized
in 1984 , during the time of his exile in the west , tarkovsky revisited the screenplay and made a few changes
he also considered to finally direct a film based on the screenplay but ultimately dropped this idea
under the influence of glasnost and perestroika , tarkovsky was finally recognized in the soviet union in the autumn of 1986 , shortly before his death , by a retrospective of his films in moscow
after his death , an entire issue of the film magazine iskusstvo kino was devoted to tarkovsky
in their obituaries , the film committee of the council of ministers of the soviet union and the union of soviet film makers expressed their sorrow that tarkovsky had to spend the last years of his life in exile
posthumously , he was awarded the lenin prize in 1990 , one of the highest state honors in the soviet union
in 1989 , the andrei tarkovsky memorial prize was established , with its first recipient being the russian animator yuri norstein
in three consecutive events , the moscow international film festival awarded the andrei tarkovsky award in 1993 , 1995 , and 1997
tarkovsky has been the subject of several documentaries
most notable is the 1988 documentary moscow elegy , by russian film director alexander sokurov
sokurovs own work has been heavily influenced by tarkovsky
the film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from tarkovskys films directed by andrei tarkovsky is a 1988 documentary film by michal leszczylowski , an editor of the film the sacrifice
film director chris marker produced the television documentary one day in the life of andrei arsenevich as an homage to andrei tarkovsky in 2000
at the entrance to the gerasimov institute of cinematography in moscow , there is a monument that includes statues of tarkovsky , gennady shpalikov and vasily shukshin
the swedish filmmaker ingmar bergman was quoted as saying tarkovsky for me is the greatest of us all , the one who invented a new language , true to the nature of film , as it captures life as a reflection , life as a dream
title quote of 2003 tarkovsky festival program , pacific film archive
the japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa remarked on tarkovskys films as saying his unusual sensitivity is both overwhelming and astounding
it almost reaches a pathological intensity
probably there is no equal among film directors alive now
kurosawa also commented i love all of tarkovskys films i love his personality and all his works
every cut from his films is a marvelous image in itself
but the finished image is nothing more than the imperfect accomplishment of his idea
his ideas are only realized in part
and he had to make do with it
the iranian filmmaker abbas kiarostami remarked that tarkovskys works separate me completely from physical life , and are the most spiritual films i have seen
the polish filmmaker krzysztof kieślowski commented that andrei tarkovsky was one of the greatest directors of recent years , and regarded tarkovskys film , ivans childhood as an influence on his own work
the turkish filmmaker nuri bilge ceylan stated that to be bored in films is not important , it may be because you are not ready for that movie
it’s not the fault of the movie
ceylan said when he first discovered the films of andrei tarkovsky as a college student unsure of what he wanted to do with his life , he was utterly baffled by the lauded russian master
he walked out of a screening of solaris at the halfway point , and stopped a vhs tape of mirror at a similar juncture
today , he considers the latter to be the greatest film ever made
“i’ve seen it maybe 20 times , ” he says
the armenian filmmaker sergei paradjanov remarked that watching tarkovskys film , ivans childhood was his main inspiration to become a filmmaker by saying i did not know how to do anything and i would not have done anything if there had not been ivans childhood
the austrian filmmaker michael haneke voted for mirror on his top 10 films in the 2002 sight sound directors poll and later said that he has seen the picture at least 25 times
the german filmmaker wim wenders dedicated his film wings of desire to tarkovsky ( along with françois truffaut and yasujirō ozu )
the french filmmaker chris marker directed a documentary film as a homage to tarkovsky called one day in the life of andrei arsenevich and used tarkovskys concept of the zone ( from the film , stalker ) for his 1983 film essay , sans soleil
the greek filmmaker theo angelopoulos regarded tarkokvskys film stalker as one of the films that influenced him
the greek - australian filmmaker alex proyas was extremely influenced by tarkovskys work and cited stalker as one his favorite films
the french philosopher jean - paul sartre highly praised tarkovskys film ivans childhood , saying that it was one of the most beautiful films he had ever seen
the japanese anime filmmaker mamoru oshii , known for his works such as ghost in the shell was influenced by tarkovsky
the indian - born british american novelist salman rushdie praised tarkovsky and his work solaris by calling it a a sci - fi masterpiece
film historian steven dillon says that much of subsequent film was deeply influenced by the films of tarkovsky
mexican filmmaker alejandro gonzález iñarritu is a huge fan of tarkovsky
he once said in an interview andrei rublev is maybe my favorite film ever , and in another interview , he added i remember , the first time i saw a tarkovsky film , i was shocked by it
i did not know what to do
i was shocked by it
i was fascinated , because suddenly i realized that film could have so many more layers to it than what i had imagined before
there are many direct references and hidden tributes to tarkovskys movies in iñarritus 2015 oscar - winning drama the revenant
danish film director lars von trier is a fervent admirer of tarkovsky
he dedicated his 2009 film antichrist to him , and , while discussing it with critic david jenkins , asked “have you seen mirror i was hypnotised i’ve seen it 20 times
it’s the closest thing i’ve got to a religion – to me he is a god
ambiguity is a type of meaning in which a phrase , statement or resolution is not explicitly defined , making several interpretations plausible
a common aspect of ambiguity is uncertainty
it is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose intended meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps
( the ambi - part of the term reflects an idea of two , as in two meanings
the concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with vagueness
in ambiguity , specific and distinct interpretations are permitted ( although some may not be immediately obvious ) , whereas with information that is vague , it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity
lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity
the former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context - dependent interpretations
the latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations , none of which may have a standard agreed - upon meaning
this form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness
the lexical ambiguity of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs
meaning here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary
for instance , the word bank has several distinct lexical definitions , including financial institution and edge of a river
or consider apothecary
one could say i bought herbs from the apothecary
this could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary ( pharmacist ) or went to the apothecary ( pharmacy )
the context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended
if , for instance , someone says i buried 100 in the bank , most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud
however , some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word
lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context , a task referred to as word - sense disambiguation
the use of multi - defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context , and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning ( in which case , a less ambiguous term should have been used )
the goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver ( s ) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed
an exception to this could include a politician whose weasel words and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from their candidate of choice
ambiguity is a powerful tool of political science
more problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts
good , for example , can mean useful or functional ( thats a good hammer ) , exemplary ( shes a good student ) , pleasing ( this is good soup ) , moral ( a good person versus the lesson to be learned from a story ) , righteous , etcetera i have a good daughter is not clear about which sense is intended
the various ways to apply prefixes and suffixes can also create ambiguity ( unlockable can mean capable of being unlocked or impossible to lock )
semantic ambiguity occurs when a word , phrase or sentence , taken out of context , has more than one interpretation
in we saw her duck ( example due to richard nordquist ) , the words her duck can refer either
syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can have two ( or more ) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence—its syntax
this is often due to a modifying expression , such as a prepositional phrase , the application of which is unclear
he ate the cookies on the couch , for example , could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch ( as opposed to those that were on the table ) , or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies
to get in , you will need an entrance fee of 10 or your voucher and your drivers license
this could mean that you need either ten dollars or both your voucher and your license
or it could mean that you need your license and you need either ten dollars or a voucher
only rewriting the sentence , or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity
critical thinking , 10th ed
, ch 3 , moore , brooke and parker , richard
mcgraw - hill , 2012
for the notion of , and theoretic results about , syntactic ambiguity in artificial , formal languages ( such as computer programming languages ) , see ambiguous grammar
usually , semantic and syntactic ambiguity go hand in hand
the sentence we saw her duck is also syntactically ambiguous
conversely , a sentence like he ate the cookies on the couch is also semantically ambiguous
rarely , but occasionally , the different parsings of a syntactically ambiguous phrase result in the same meaning
for example , the command cook , cook can be parsed as cook ( noun used as vocative ) , cook ( imperative verb form ) , but also as cook ( imperative verb form ) , cook ( noun used as vocative )
it is more common that a syntactically unambiguous phrase has a semantic ambiguity ; for example , the lexical ambiguity in your boss is a funny man is purely semantic , leading to the response funny ha - ha or funny peculiar
spoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities , where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words
for example , ice cream and i scream
such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context
a mishearing of such , based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity , is called a mondegreen
philosophers ( and other users of logic ) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing ( or intentionally adding ) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments
for example , a politician might say , i oppose taxes which hinder economic growth , an example of a glittering generality
some will think they oppose taxes in general because they hinder economic growth
others may think they oppose only those taxes that they believe will hinder economic growth
in writing , the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation , either by adding a comma after taxes ( to convey the first sense ) or by changing which to that ( to convey the second sense ) or by rewriting it in other ways
the devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way , and think the politician supports everyones opinion
however , the opposite can also be true—an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity ( intentionally or not )
the logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases
in continental philosophy ( particularly phenomenology and existentialism ) , there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity , as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition
martin heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous , as is the relation of mind and body , and part and whole
in heideggers phenomenology , dasein is always in a meaningful world , but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification
thus , although some things may be certain , they have little to do with daseins sense of care and existential anxiety , for example , in the face of death
in calling his work being and nothingness an essay in phenomenological ontology jean - paul sartre follows heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous , or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity
simone de beauvoir tries to base an ethics on heideggers and sartres writings ( the ethics of ambiguity ) , where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought , most of them have tried to mask it and the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued the same goal
it has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality , by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it , by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment
ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic , or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science
she states since we do not succeed in fleeing it , let us , therefore , try to look the truth in the face
let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity
it is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting
other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life , nature , and sex are ambiguous
corey anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else language , he asserts , divides what is not , in fact , separate
following ernest becker , he argues that the desire to authoritatively disambiguate the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide
on this basis , he argues that ethics must focus on dialectically integrating opposites and balancing tension , rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty
like the existentialists and phenomenologists , he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity
in literature and rhetoric , ambiguity can be a useful tool
groucho marxs classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor , for example last night i shot an elephant in my pajamas
how he got in my pajamas , ill never know
songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect , as in the song title dont it make my brown eyes blue ( where blue can refer to the color , or to sadness )
in the narrative , ambiguity can be introduced in several ways motive , plot , character
scott fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel the great gatsby
mathematical notation , widely used in physics and other sciences , avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language
however , for various reasons , several lexical , syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain
the ambiguity in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a multivalued function , which can ( and should ) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way
several special functions still do not have established notations
usually , the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value ; sometimes , the same name of the function is used , causing confusions
examples of such underestablished functions
it is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions
also , it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function , for example , ff ( x )
then , if one sees ff ( y1 ) , there is no way to distinguish whether it means ff ( x ) multiplied by ( y1 ) , or function f evaluated at argument equal to ( y1 )
in each case of use of such notations , the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning
creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities
many algorithmic languages ( c and fortran ) require the character as symbol of multiplication
the wolfram language used in mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol , but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function ; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions
fortran , in addition , does not allow use of the same name ( identifier ) for different objects , for example , function and variable ; in particular , the expression ff ( x ) is qualified as an error
the order of operations may depend on the context
in most programming languages , the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right
until the last century , many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first , for example , a / bc is interpreted as a / ( bc ) ; in this case , the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language
in addition , it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis , which also may lead to ambiguity
in the scientific journal style , one uses roman letters to denote elementary functions , whereas variables are written using italics
commas in multi - component subscripts and superscripts are sometimes omitted ; this is also potentially ambiguous notation
for example , in the notation tmnk , the reader can only infer from the context whether it means a single - index object , taken with the subscript equal to product of variables m , n and k , or it is an indication to a trivalent tensor
an expression such as sin2alpha / 2 can be understood to mean either ( sin ( alpha / 2 ) ) 2 or ( sin alpha ) 2 / 2
often the authors intention can be understood from the context , in cases where only one of the two makes sense , but an ambiguity like this should be avoided , for example by writing sin2 ( alpha / 2 ) or frac12sin2alpha
the expression sin - 1alpha means arcsin ( alpha ) in several texts , though it might be thought to mean ( sin alpha ) - 1 , since sinn alpha commonly means ( sin alpha ) n
conversely , sin2 alpha might seem to mean sin ( sin alpha ) , as this exponentiation notation usually denotes function iteration in general , f2 ( x ) means f ( f ( x ) )
however , for trigonometric and hyperbolic functions , this notation conventionally means exponentiation of the result of function application
the expression a / 2b can be interpreted as meaning ( a / 2 ) b ; however , it is more commonly understood to mean a / ( 2b )
it is common to define the coherent states in quantum optics with alpharangle and states with fixed number of photons with nrangle
then , there is an unwritten rule the state is coherent if there are more greek characters than latin characters in the argument , and nphoton state if the latin characters dominate
the ambiguity becomes even worse , if xrangle is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate , and prangle means the state with certain value of the momentum , which may be used in books on quantum mechanics
such ambiguities easily lead to confusions , especially if some normalized adimensional , dimensionless variables are used
expression 1rangle may mean a state with single photon , or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1 , or state with momentum equal to unity , and so on
the reader is supposed to guess from the context
some physical quantities do not yet have established notations ; their value ( and sometimes even dimension , as in the case of the einstein coefficients ) , depends on the system of notations
many terms are ambiguous
each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition , suitable for a specific case
just like ludwig wittgenstein states in tractatus logico - philosophicus
a highly confusing term is gain
for example , the sentence the gain of a system should be doubled , without context , means close to nothing
the term intensity is ambiguous when applied to light
the term can refer to any of irradiance , luminous intensity , radiant intensity , or radiance , depending on the background of the person using the term
also , confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant , or resolution of an imaging system , as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise
see also accuracy and precision and its talk
the berry paradox arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as definable or nameable
terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies
other terms with this type of ambiguity are satisfiable , true , false , function , property , class , relation , cardinal , and ordinal
in mathematics and logic , ambiguity can be considered to be an instance of the logical concept of underdetermination—for example , xy leaves open what the value of x is—while its opposite is a self - contradiction , also called inconsistency , paradoxicalness , or oxymoron , or in mathematics an inconsistent system—such as x2 , x3 , which has no solution
logical ambiguity and self - contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and impossible objects , such as the necker cube and impossible cube , or many of the drawings of escher
some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity , especially lexical ambiguity
lojban and loglan are two related languages which have been created for this , focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well
the languages can be both spoken and written
these languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages , although historically , such attempts at language improvement have been criticized
languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency
the many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are time - consuming and difficult to learn
in structural biology , ambiguity has been recognized as a problem for studying protein conformations
the analysis of a protein three - dimensional structure consists in dividing the macromolecule into subunits called domains
the difficulty of this task arises from the fact that different definitions of what a domain is can be used ( for example folding autonomy , function , thermodynamic stability , or domain motions ) , which sometimes results in a single protein having different—yet equally valid—domain assignments
christianity and judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with ambiguity
many christians and jews endorse rudolf ottos description of the sacred as mysterium tremendum et fascinans , the awe - inspiring mystery which fascinates humans
the orthodox catholic writer chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases
( the title of one of his most famous books , orthodoxy , itself employing such a paradox
in music , pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous , such as some polytonality , polymeter , other ambiguous meters or rhythms , and ambiguous phrasing , or ( stein 2005 , p
195 ) , theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value
in visual art , certain images are visually ambiguous , such as the necker cube , which can be interpreted in two ways
perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time , then may flip , a phenomenon called multistable perception
pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level the visual image is unambiguous , but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear , for instance
in social psychology , ambiguity is a factor used in determining peoples responses to various situations
high levels of ambiguity in an emergency ( for example an unconscious man lying on a park bench ) make witnesses less likely to offer any sort of assistance , due to the fear that they may have misinterpreted the situation and acted unnecessarily
alternately , non - ambiguous emergencies ( for example an injured person verbally asking for help ) illicit more consistent intervention and assistance
with regard to the bystander effect , studies have shown that emergencies deemed ambiguous trigger the appearance of the classic bystander effect ( wherein more witnesses decrease the likelihood of any of them helping ) far more than non - ambiguous emergencies
in computer science , the si prefixes kilo - , mega - and giga - were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 ( 1024 , 10242 and 10243 ) contrary to the metric system in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand , one million , and one billion
this usage is particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices ( for example dram ) addressed directly by a binary machine register where a decimal interpretation makes no practical sense
subsequently , the ki , mi , and gi prefixes were introduced so that binary prefixes could be written explicitly , also rendering k , m , and g unambiguous in texts conforming to the new standard—this led to a new ambiguity in engineering documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes ( necessarily indicating the new style ) as to whether the usage of k , m , and g remains ambiguous ( old style ) or not ( new style )
1 m ( where m is ambiguously 1 , 000 , 000 or 1 , 048 , 576 ) is less uncertain than the engineering value 1e6 ( defined to designate the interval 950 , 000 to 1 , 050 , 000 )
as non - volatile storage devices begin to exceed 1 gb in capacity ( where the ambiguity begins to routinely impact the second significant digit ) , gb and tb almost always mean 109 and 1012 bytes
abel héḇel , in pausa hábel ; is a biblical figure in the book of genesis within abrahamic religions
he was the younger brother of cain , and the younger son of adam and eve , the first couple in biblical history
he was a shepherd who offered his firstborn flock up to god as an offering
god accepted his offering but not his brothers
cain then killed abel out of jealousy
according to the narrative in genesis , abel ( hā́ḇel ; , hābēl ) is eves second son
his name in hebrew is composed of the same three consonants as a root meaning breath
julius wellhausen has proposed that the name is independent of the root
eberhard schrader had previously put forward the akkadian ( old assyrian dialect ) ablu ( son ) as a more likely etymology
in christianity , comparisons are sometimes made between the death of abel and that of jesus , the former thus seen as being the first martyr
the blood of jesus is interpreted as bringing mercy ; but that of abel as demanding vengeance ( hence the curse and mark )
abel is invoked in the litany for the dying in the roman catholic church , and his sacrifice is mentioned in the canon of the mass along with those of abraham and melchizedek
the alexandrian rite commemorates him with a feast day on december 28
according to the coptic book of adam and eve ( at 21–15 ) , and the syriac cave of treasures , abels body , after many days of mourning , was placed in the cave of treasures , before which adam and eve , and descendants , offered their prayers
in addition , the sethite line of the generations of adam swear by abels blood to segregate themselves from the unrighteous
in the book of enoch ( 227 ) , regarded by most christian and jewish traditions as extra - biblical , the soul of abel is described as having been appointed as the chief of martyrs , crying for vengeance , for the destruction of the seed of cain
a similar view is later shown in the testament of abraham ( a13 / b11 ) , where abel has been raised to the position as the judge of the souls
in the apocryphon of john , a work belonging to sethian gnosticism , abel is the offspring of yaldaboath and eve , who is placed over the elements of water and earth as elohim , but was only given his name as a form of deception
according to mandaean beliefs and scriptures including the qolastā , the book of john and genzā rabbā , abel is cognate with the angelic soteriological figure hibil ziwa , or of manda d - hayyi , elsewhere , anush is spoken of as the son of sheetil , and sheetil as the son of hibil , where hibil came to adam and eve as a young boy when they were still virgins , but was called their son
as yawar hibil , he is one of multiple figures known as yawar (
according to shia muslim belief , abel ( habeel ) is buried in the nabi habeel mosque , located on the west mountains of damascus , near the zabadani valley , overlooking the villages of the barada river ( wadi barada ) , in syria
shia are frequent visitors of this mosque for ziyarat
the mosque was built by ottoman wali ahmad pasha in 1599
the aardvark ( ; orycteropus afer ) is a medium - sized , burrowing , nocturnal mammal native to africa
although other prehistoric species and genera of tubulidentata are known
unlike most other insectivores , it has a long pig - like snout , which is used to sniff out food
it roams over most of the southern two - thirds of the african continent , avoiding areas that are mainly rocky
a nocturnal feeder , it subsists on ants and termites , which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs
it also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young
the animal is listed as least concern by the iucn , although its numbers are decreasing
aardvarks are afrotheres , a clade which also includes elephants , manatees , and hyraxes
the aardvark is sometimes colloquially called the african ant bear , ) , comes from earlier afrikaans erdvark and means earth pig or ground pig ( aarde earth / ground , vark pig ) , because of its burrowing habits

the name orycteropus means burrowing foot , and the name afer refers to africa
the name of the aardvarks order , tubulidentata , comes from the tubule - style teeth
the aardvark is not closely related to the pig ; rather , it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata , along with the sirenians , hyraxes , elephants , studies of the brain have shown the similarities with condylarthra , and given the clades status as a wastebasket taxon it may mean some species traditionally classified as condylarths are actually stem - aardvarks
based on fossils , bryan patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in africa around the end of the paleocene
the first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably myorycteropus africanus from kenyan miocene deposits
the earliest example from the genus orycteropus was orycteropus mauritanicus , found in algeria in deposits from the middle miocene , with an equally old version found in kenya
fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years , and have been located throughout europe and the near east
the mysterious pleistocene plesiorycteropus from madagascar was originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the eocene
however , a number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that plesiorycteropus is a relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvark - like appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution
the 1911 encyclopædia britannica also mentions a
capensis or cape ant - bear from south africa
an aardvarks weight is typically between , and can reach lengths of ) is taken into account
it is
it is the largest member of the proposed clade afroinsectiphilia
the aardvark is pale yellowish - gray in color and often stained reddish - brown by soil
the aardvarks coat is thin , and the animals primary protection is its tough skin
its hair is short on its head and tail ; however its legs tend to have longer hair
the hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3 - 4 hairs
the hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs
its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers
the greatly elongated head is set on a short , thick neck , and the end of the snout bears a disc , which houses the nostrils
it contains a thin but complete zygomatic arch
the head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features
one of the most distinctive characteristics of the tubulidentata is their teeth
instead of having a pulp cavity , each tooth has a cluster of thin , hexagonal , upright , parallel tubes of vasodentin ( a modified form of dentine ) , with individual pulp canals , held together by cementum
the number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth , with the largest having about 1 , 500
the teeth have no enamel coating and are worn away and regrow continuously
the aardvark is born with conventional incisors and canines at the front of the jaw , which fall out and are not replaced
adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the jaw , and have a dental formula of the teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars
the nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area , as it contains ten nasal conchae , more than any other placental mammal
the sides of the nostrils are thick with hair
the tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified mimetic muscles
the fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions , but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature
the snout resembles an elongated pig snout
the mouth is small and tubular , typical of species that feed on ants and termites
the aardvark has a long , thin , snakelike , protruding tongue ( as much as the ears , which are very effective , are disproportionately long , about long
the eyes are small for its head , and consist only of rods
the aardvarks stomach has a muscular pyloric area that acts as a gizzard to grind swallowed food up , thereby rendering chewing unnecessary
its cecum is large
both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland
its salivary glands are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck ; their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness
the female has two pairs of teats in the inguinal region
genetically speaking , the aardvark is a living fossil , as its chromosomes are highly conserved , reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa
aardvarks are found in sub - saharan africa , where suitable habitat ( savannas , grasslands , woodlands and bushland ) and food ( that is , ants and termites ) is available
the only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest , as the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth
they also avoid terrain rocky enough to cause problems with digging
in ethiopia
they are present throughout sub - saharan africa all the way to south africa with few exceptions including the coastal areas of namibia , ivory coast , and ghana
they are not found in madagascar
aardvarks live for up to 23years in captivity
its keen hearing warns it of predators lions , leopards , cheetahs , african wild dogs , hyenas , and pythons
some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat
aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies , but if all else fails , they will strike with their claws , tail and shoulders , sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet
they are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker
they will also dig to escape as they can
sometimes , when pressed , aardvarks can dig extremely quickly
the aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites ( myrmecophagy ) ;
while foraging for food , the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward , which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food
they zig - zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5–8 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again
during a foraging period , they will stop to dig a v shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location
when a concentration of ants or termites is detected , the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs , keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators , and takes up an astonishing number of insects with its long , sticky tongue—as many as 50 , 000 in one night have been recorded
its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly
it avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils
when successful , the aardvarks long ( up to termite mounds alone dont provide enough food for the aardvark , so they look for termites that are on the move
when these insects move , they can form columns long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark
these columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals
the trampled grass and dung attract termites from the odontotermes , microtermes , and pseudacanthotermes genera
on a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of night ( roughly the four hours between 800a
) ; however , they dont seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other
during adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems they cover between in a night
the aardvark is a rather quiet animal
however , it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance
it makes a bleating sound if frightened
when it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows
if one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly
this new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear
the aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents
it can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes , but otherwise moves fairly slowly
when leaving the burrow at night , they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes , sniffing and listening
after this period of watchfulness , it will bound out and within seconds it will be away
it will then pause , prick its ears , twisting its head to listen , then jump and move off to start foraging
aside from digging out ants and termites , the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live , which generally fall into one of three categories burrows made while foraging , refuge and resting location , and permanent homes
temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges , while the main burrow is also used for breeding
main burrows can be deep and extensive , have several entrances and can be as long as
aardvarks pair only during the breeding season ; after a gestation period of seven months , one cub weighing around is born during may–july
when born , the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles
when nursing , it will nurse off each teat in succession
after two weeks , the folds of skin disappear and after three , the ears can be held upright
after 5–6 weeks , body hair starts growing
it is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks and eats termites at 9weeks , and is weaned between three months and 16weeks
at six months of age , it is able to dig its own burrows , but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season , and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age
aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers , however , this is possibly because they are not readily seen
there are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits ; however , their numbers seem to be stable overall
they are not considered common anywhere in africa , but due to their large range , they maintain sufficient numbers
there may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern , northern , and western africa
southern african numbers are not decreasing
it receives an official designation from the iucn as least concern
however , they are a species in a precarious situation , as they are so dependent on such specific food ; therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites , the species as a whole would be affected drastically
aardvarks handle captivity well
the first zoo to have one was london zoo in 1869 , which had an animal from south africa
in african folklore , the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants
hausa magicians make a charm from the heart , skin , forehead , and nails of the aardvark , which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree
wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest , the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night
the charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents permission
also , some tribes , such as the margbetu , ayanda , and logo , will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets , which are regarded as good luck charms the meat , which has a resemblance to pork , is eaten in certain cultures
the ancient egyptian god set is usually depicted with the head of an unidentified animal , whose similarity to an aardvark has been noted in scholarship
the titular character of arthur , an animated television series for children based on a book series and produced by wgbh , shown in more than 180 countries , is an aardvark
in the first book of the series , arthurs nose ( 1976 ) , he has a long , aardvark - like nose , but in later books , his face becomes more rounded
an aardvark features as the antagonist in the cartoon the ant and the aardvark as well as in the canadian animated series the raccoons
the supersonic fighter - bomber f - 111 / fb - 111 was nicknamed the aardvark because of its long nose resembling the animal
it also had similarities with its nocturnal missions flown at a very low level employing ordnance that could penetrate deep into the ground
in the us navy , the squadron vf - 114 was nicknamed the aardvarks , flying f - 4s and then f - 14s
the squadron mascot was adapted from the animal in the comic strip , which the f - 4 was said to resemble
the aardwolf ( proteles cristata ) is an insectivorous mammal in the family hyaenidae , native to east and southern africa
its name means earth - wolf in afrikaans and dutch
it is also called maanhaar - jackal and civet hyena , based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland , a characteristic shared with the african civet
unlike many of its relatives in the order carnivora , the aardwolf does not hunt large animals
it eats insects and their larvae , mainly termites ; one aardwolf can lap up as many as 250 , 000 termites during a single night using its long , sticky tongue
the aardwolfs tongue has adapted to be tough enough to withstand the strong bite of termites
the aardwolf lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern africa – open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs
it is nocturnal , resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food
the aardwolf is generally classified with the hyena family hyaenidae , though it was formerly placed in its own family protelidae
early on , scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the striped hyena , which subsequently led to the creation of protelidae
the aardwolf is the only surviving species in the subfamily protelinae
there is disagreement as to whether the species is monotypic , or can be divided into subspecies c
cristatus of southern africa and c
septentrionalis of east africa
the generic name proteles comes from two words both of greek origin , protos and teleos which combined means complete in front based on the fact that they have five toes on their front feet and four on the rear
the specific name , cristatus , comes from latin and means provided with a comb , relating to their mane
the aardwolf resembles a very thin striped hyena , but with a more slender muzzle , black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur , and a long , distinct mane down the midline of the neck and back
it also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore - and hind - quarters , along with several stripes on its legs
the mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger
it is missing the throat spot that others in the family have
its lower leg ( from the knee down ) is all black , and its tail is bushy with a black tip
the aardwolf is about long , tall at the shoulders
, sometimes reaching the aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller ( about )
this makes the aardwolf , the smallest extant member of the hyaenidae family
the front feet have five toes each , unlike the four - toed hyena
the teeth and skull are similar to those of other hyenas , though smaller , and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects
it does still have canines , but , unlike other hyenas , these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense
its ears , which are large , are very similar to those of the striped hyena
as an aardwolf ages , it will normally lose some of its teeth , though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats
aardwolves live in open , dry plains and bushland , avoiding mountainous areas
due to their specific food requirements , they are only found in regions where termites of the family hodotermitidae occur
termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs , including farmland
for most of the year , aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens , which are occupied for six weeks at a time
there are two distinct populations one in southern africa , and another in east and northeast africa
the species does not occur in the intermediary miombo forests
aardwolves are shy and nocturnal , sleeping in burrows by day
they will , on occasion during the winter , become diurnal feeders
this happens during the coldest periods as they then stay in at night to conserve heat
they have often been mistaken for solitary animals
in fact , they live as monogamous pairs with their young

or to the border
if the intruder is caught , which rarely happens , a fight will occur , which is accompanied by soft clucking , hoarse barking , and a type of roar
the majority of incursions occur during mating season , when they can occur once or twice per week
when food is scarce , the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a single territory
the territory is marked by both sexes , as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in
at this rate , an individual may mark 60 marks per hour , and upwards of 200 per night
an aardwolf pair may have up to 10 dens , and numerous feces middens , within their territory
when they deposit excreta at their middens , they dig a small hole and cover it with sand
their dens are usually abandoned aardvark , springhare , or porcupine dens , or on occasion they are crevices in rocks
they will also dig their own dens , or enlarge dens started by springhares
they typically will only use one or two dens at a time , rotating through all of their dens every six months
during the summer , they may rest outside their den during the night , and sleep underground during the heat of the day
aardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators
therefore , when threatened , the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks
if confronted , it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing
it also emits a foul - smelling liquid from its anal glands
the aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on trinervitermes
their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the aardvark , which digs into the mound
they locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites
an aardwolf may consume up to 250 , 000 termites per night using its long , sticky tongue
they do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony , thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food
they often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months
during certain seasonal events , such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter , the primary termites become scarce , so the need for other foods becomes pronounced
during these times , the southern aardwolf will seek out hodotermes mossambicus , a type of harvester termite active in the afternoon , which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter
the eastern aardwolf , during the rainy season , subsists on termites from the genera odontotermes and macrotermes
they are also known to feed on other insects , larvae , eggs , and , some sources say , occasionally small mammals and birds , but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet
unlike other hyenas , aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals
contrary to popular myths , aardwolves do not eat carrion , and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass , they are actually eating larvae and beetles
also , contrary to some sources , they do not like meat , unless it is finely ground or cooked for them
the adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups , but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers , necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey
their primary source , trinervitermes , forages in small but dense patches of per hour , which translates to per winter night
the breeding season varies depending on location , but normally takes place during autumn or spring
in south africa , breeding occurs in early july
during the breeding season , unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory , as well as others , for a female to mate with
dominant males also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves , which can result in conflict between rival males
dominant males even go a step further and as the breeding season approaches , they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males territories
as the female comes into oestrus , they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories , sometimes doing so more in rivals territories than their own
females will also , when given the opportunity , mate with the dominant male , which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding his cubs with her
copulation lasts between 1 and 4 hours
gestation lasts between 89 and 92 days , producing two to five cubs ( most often two or three ) during the rainy season ( november–december ) , when termites are more active
they are born with their eyes open , but initially are helpless , and weigh around
the first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with their parents
the male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food
after three months , they begin supervised foraging , and by four months are normally independent , though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season
by the time the next set of cubs is born , the older cubs have moved on
aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity at one and a half to two years of age
the aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and is relatively widespread throughout eastern africa
they are not common throughout their range , as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer , if food is abundant
because of these factors , the iucn has rated the aardwolf as least concern
in some areas , they are persecuted because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock ; however , they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental
in other areas , the farmers have recognized this , but they are still killed , on occasion , for their fur
dogs and insecticides are also common killers of the aardwolf
frankfurt zoo in germany was home to the oldest recorded aardwolf in captivity at 18 years and 11 months
adobe ( ; ) is a building material made from earth and organic materials , is spanish for mudbrick
in some english - speaking regions of spanish heritage , such as the southwestern united states , the term is used to refer to any kind of earthen construction , or various architectural styles like pueblo revival or territorial revival
most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to cob and rammed earth buildings
adobe is among the earliest building materials , and is used throughout the world
adobe bricks are rectangular prisms small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking
they can be subsequently assembled , with the application of adobe mud to bond the individual bricks into a structure
there is no standard size , with substantial variations over the years and in different regions
in some areas a popular size measured ; in other contexts the size is
the maximum sizes can reach up to ; above this weight it becomes difficult to move the pieces , and it is preferred to ram the mud in situ , resulting in a different typology known as rammed earth
in dry climates , adobe structures are extremely durable , and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world
adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater thermal mass , but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage if they are not reinforced
cases where adobe structures were widely damaged during earthquakes include the 1976 guatemala earthquake , the 2003 bam earthquake , and the 2010 chile earthquake
buildings made of sun - dried earth are common throughout the world ( middle east , western asia , north africa , west africa , south america , southwestern north america , southwestern and eastern europe
) adobe had been in use by indigenous peoples of the americas in the southwestern united states , mesoamerica , and the andes for several thousand years
its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture , and economics
the word adobe aṭ - ṭawbu or aṭ - ṭūbu , with the definite article al - attached
tuba , this was assimilated into the old spanish language as adobe , probably via mozarabic
english borrowed the word from spanish in the early 18th century , still referring to mudbrick construction
in more modern english usage , the term adobe has come to include a style of architecture popular in the desert climates of north america , especially in new mexico , regardless of the construction method
an adobe brick is a composite material made of earth mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung
the soil composition typically contains sand , silt and clay
straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly , thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick
another source quotes 15–25 clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles , with no deleterious effect
modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or portland cement up to 10 by weight
no more than half the clay content should be expansive clays , with the remainder non - expansive illite or kaolinite
too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick , resulting in cracking , while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick
typically the soils of the southwest united states , where such construction has been widely used , are an adequate composition
adobe walls are load bearing , that is they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure , hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength
in the united states , most building codes call for a minimum compressive strength of 300lbf / in2 ( 2newton / mm2 ) for the adobe block
adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads
the building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load
such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls , resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses
to withstand such loads , the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50lbf / in2 ( 0newton / mm2 ) for the finished block
in addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost , adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction
in climates typified by hot days and cool nights , the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day , moderating the temperature of the living space
the massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun ( radiation ) and from the surrounding air ( convection ) before they warm through to the interior
after the sun sets and the temperature drops , the warm wall will continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time - lag effect
thus , a well - planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates , a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material
thermodynamic material properties have significant variation in the literature
some experiments suggest that the standard consideration of conductivity is not adequate for this material , as its main thermodynamic property is inertia , and conclude that experimental tests should be performed over a longer period of time than usual - preferably with changing thermal jumps
which corresponds to thermal conductivity k10 in x 1ft / 12 in / r00 btu / ( hr ft °f ) or 0 w / ( m k ) in agreement with the thermal conductivity reported from another source
to determine the total r - value of a wall , scale r0 by the thickness of the wall in inches
the thermal resistance of adobe is also stated as an r - value for a 10 - inch wall r04 hr ft2 °f / btu
giving heat capacity25 btu / ( ft3 °f ) or 1700 kj / ( m3 k )
using the average value of the thermal conductivity as k 32 btu / ( hr ft °f ) or 0 w / ( m k ) , the thermal diffusivity is calculated to be 0ft2 / h or 3x10−7 m2 / s
poured and puddled adobe ( puddled clay , piled earth ) , today called cob , is made by placing soft adobe in layers , rather than by making individual dried bricks or using a form
puddle is a general term for a clay or clay and sand - based material worked into a dense , plastic state
these are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the americas until holes in the ground were used as forms , and later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the spanish

bricks made from adobe are usually made by pressing the mud mixture into an open timber frame
in north america , the brick is typically about in size
the mixture is molded into the frame , which is removed after initial setting
after drying for a few hours , the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying
slow drying in shade reduces cracking
the same mixture , without straw , is used to make mortar and often plaster on interior and exterior walls
some cultures used lime - based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage
depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed , adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size , provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks
reinforcement can include manure , straw , cement , rebar , or wooden posts
straw , cement , or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can produce a stronger , more crack - resistant brick
during the great depression , designer and builder hugh comstock used cheaper materials and made a specialized adobe brick called bitudobe
his first adobe house was built in 1936
in 1948 , he published the book post - adobe ; simplified adobe construction combining a rugged timber frame and modern stabilized adobe , which described his method of construction , including how to make bitudobe
in 1938 , he served as an adviser to the architects franklin kump associates , who built the carmel high school , which used his post - adobe system
the ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed , as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall
footing depth is to be below the ground frost level
the footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick , respectively
modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall
adobe bricks are laid by course
adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength
when creating window and door openings , a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above
atop the last courses of brick , bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces
to protect the interior and exterior adobe walls , finishes such as mud plaster , whitewash or stucco can be applied
these protect the adobe wall from water damage , but need to be reapplied periodically
alternatively , the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection
bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters
the traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soil / clay , water , sand and organic materials
the mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms , producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe
depending on the materials available , a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks
depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks , the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly
this method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking
the more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads
the heaviest wooden beams , called vigas , lie atop the wall
across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas and upon those brush is then laid
finally , the adobe layer is applied
to construct a flat adobe roof , beams of wood were laid to span the building , the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls
once the vigas , latillas and brush are laid , adobe bricks are placed
an adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof
following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar , recommended to be at least howstuffworksaccess - date2017 - 10 - 24languageen
roof design evolved around 1850 in the american southwest
three inches of adobe mud was applied on top of the latillas , then 18 inches of dry adobe dirt applied to the roof
the dirt was contoured into a low slope to a downspout aka a canal
when moisture was applied to the roof the clay particles expanded to create a waterproof membrane
once a year it was necessary to pull the weeds from the roof and re - slope the dirt as needed
depending on the materials , adobe roofs can be inherently fire - proof
the construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports , creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials
the builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls
in 1927 , the uniform building code ( ubc ) was adopted in the united states
local ordinances , referencing the ubc added requirements to building with adobe
these included restriction of building height of adobe structures to 1 - story , requirements for adobe mix ( compressive and shear strength ) and new requirements which stated that every building shall be designed to withstand seismic activity , specifically lateral forces
by the 1980s however , seismic related changes in the california building code effectively ended solid wall adobe construction in california ; however post - and - beam adobe and veneers are still being used
the largest structure ever made from adobe is the arg - é bam built by the achaemenid empire
other large adobe structures are the huaca del sol in peru , with 100 million signed bricks and the ciudellas of chan chan and tambo colorado , both in peru

an adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold , sometimes risky
adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling , exploring , skydiving , mountain climbing , scuba diving , river rafting or participating in extreme sports
adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained in a risky manner
adventurous experiences create psychological arousal , which can be interpreted as negative ( for example fear ) or positive ( for example flow )
for some people , adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself
according to adventurer andré malraux , in his la condition humaine ( 1933 ) , if a man is not ready to risk his life , where is his dignity
outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism
adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge , such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the british adventurer jason lewis , for example , uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren
adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning
author jon levy suggests that an experience should meet several criteria to be considered an adventure
some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as homers the odyssey
the knight errant was the form the adventure seeker character took in the late middle ages
the adventure novel exhibits these protagonist on adventurous journey characteristics as do many popular feature films , such as star wars
adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or mother nature
examples include books such as hatchet or my side of the mountain
these books are less about questing , such as in mythology or other adventure novels , but more about surviving on their own , living off the land , gaining new experiences , and becoming closer to the natural world
many adventures are based on the idea of a quest the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward , whether it be a skill , prize , treasure , or perhaps the safety of a person
on the way , the hero must overcome various obstacles to obtain their reward
in video - game culture , an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle - solving
from ancient times , travelers and explorers have written about their adventures
journals which became best - sellers in their day were written , such as marco polos journal the travels of marco polo or mark twains roughing it
others were personal journals , only later published , such as the journals of lewis and clark or captain james cooks journals
there are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question , such as the right stuff by tom wolfe or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal , such as conquistadors of the useless by lionel terray
documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well
there are many sports classified as adventure games or sports , due to their inherent danger and excitement
some of these include mountain climbing , skydiving , or other extreme sports
asia ( , about 30 of earths total land area and 8 of the earths total surface area
the continent , which has long been home to the majority of the human population , was the site of many of the first civilizations
its 4 billion people
in general terms , asia is bounded on the east by the pacific ocean , on the south by the indian ocean , and on the north by the arctic ocean
the border of asia with europe is a historical and cultural construct , as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them
it is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity
the division of eurasia into two continents reflects east–west cultural , linguistic , and ethnic differences , some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line
a commonly accepted division places asia to the east of the suez canal separating it from africa ; and to the east of the turkish straits , the ural mountains and ural river , and to the south of the caucasus mountains and the caspian and black seas , separating it from europe
68–69 ) ; asia ( pp
90–91 ) a commonly accepted division between asia and europe is formed by the ural mountains , ural river , caspian sea , caucasus mountains , and the black sea with its outlets , the bosporus and dardanelles
china and india alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 ce
china was a major economic power and attracted many to the east , attracting european commerce , exploration and colonialism
the accidental discovery of a trans - atlantic route from europe to america by columbus while in search for a route to india demonstrates this deep fascination
the silk road became the main east–west trading route in the asian hinterlands while the straits of malacca stood as a major sea route
asia has exhibited economic dynamism ( particularly east asia ) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century , but overall population growth has since fallen
asia was the birthplace of most of the worlds mainstream religions including hinduism , zoroastrianism , judaism , jainism , buddhism , confucianism , taoism , christianity , islam , sikhism , as well as many other religions
given its size and diversity , the concept of asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography
asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups , cultures , environments , economics , historical ties and government systems it also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the middle east , temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in siberia
the boundary between asia and africa is the red sea , the gulf of suez , and the suez canal
this makes egypt a transcontinental country , with the sinai peninsula in asia and the remainder of the country in africa
the threefold division of the old world into europe , asia and africa has been in use since the 6th century bc , due to greek geographers such as anaximander and hecataeus
anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river ( the modern rioni river ) in georgia of caucasus ( from its mouth by poti on the black sea coast , through the surami pass and along the kura river to the caspian sea ) , a convention still followed by herodotus in the 5th century bc
during the hellenistic period , according to strabo ( geographica 11
4 ) even at the time of alexander , it was agreed by all that the tanais river separated asia from europe ( langgrcὡμολόγητο ἐκ πάντων ὅτι διείργει τὴν ἀσίαν ἀπὸ
and asia is connected to europe by the land - strait between lake maiotis and the sarmatian ocean where the river tanais crosses through
in sweden , five years after peters death , in 1730 philip johan von strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the ural mountains as the border of asia
tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von strahlenberg
the latter had suggested the emba river as the lower boundary
over the next century various proposals were made until the ural river prevailed in the mid - 19th century
the border had been moved perforce from the black sea to the caspian sea into which the ural river projects
the border between the black sea and the caspian is usually placed along the crest of the caucasus mountains , although it is sometimes placed further north
the border between asia and the region of oceania is usually placed somewhere in the malay archipelago
the maluku islands in indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast asia , with new guinea , to the east of the islands , being wholly part of oceania
the terms southeast asia and oceania , devised in the 19th century , have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception
the chief factor in determining which islands of the malay archipelago are asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there ( not all european )
lewis and wigen assert , the narrowing of southeast asia to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process
geographical asia is a cultural artifact of european conceptions of the world , beginning with the ancient greeks , being imposed onto other cultures , an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means
asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents
from the time of herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three - continent system ( europe , africa , asia ) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them
geographically , asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of eurasia with europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass
asia , europe and africa make up a single continuous landmass—afro - eurasia ( except for the suez canal ) —and share a common continental shelf
almost all of europe and a major part of asia sit atop the eurasian plate , adjoined on the south by the arabian and indian plate and with the easternmost part of siberia ( east of the chersky range ) on the north american plate
the idea of a place called asia was originally a concept of greek civilization , reid , confucius lives next door what living in the east teaches us about living in the west vintage books ( 1999 )
though this might not correspond to the entire continent currently known by that name
the english word comes from latin literature , where it has the same form , asia
whether asia in other languages comes from latin of the roman empire is much less certain , and the ultimate source of the latin word is uncertain , though several theories have been published
one of the first classical writers to use asia as a name of the whole continent was pliny
this metonymical change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names , such as scandinavia ( from scania )
before greek poetry , the aegean sea area was in a greek dark age , at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun
prior to then in the bronze age the records of the assyrian empire , the hittite empire and the various mycenaean states of greece mention a region undoubtedly asia , certainly in anatolia , including if not identical to lydia
these records are administrative and do not include poetry
the mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 bce by unknown agents , though one school of thought assigns the dorian invasion to this time
the burning of the palaces caused the clay tablets holding the mycenaean administrative records to be preserved by baking
these tablets were written in a greek syllabic script called linear this script was deciphered by a number of interested parties , most notably by a young world war ii cryptographer , michael ventris , subsequently assisted by the scholar , john chadwick
a major cache discovered by carl blegen at the site of ancient pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods
some of these are of women held in servitude ( as study of the society implied by the content reveals )
they were used in trades , such as cloth - making , and usually came with children
the epithet lawiaiai , captives , associated with some of them identifies their origin
some are ethnic names
one in particular , aswiai , identifies women of asia
the name is also in the singular , aswia , which refers both to the name of a country and to a female from there
there is a masculine form ,
this aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the hittites as assuwa , centered on lydia , or roman asia
this name , assuwa , has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent asia
the assuwa league was a confederation of states in western anatolia , defeated by the hittites under tudhaliya i around 1400 bce
latin asia and greek ἀσία appear to be the same word
roman authors translated ἀσία as asia
the romans named a province asia , located in western anatolia ( in modern - day turkey )
there was an asia minor and an asia major located in modern - day iraq
as the earliest evidence of the name is greek , it is likely circumstantially that asia came from ἀσία , but ancient transitions , due to the lack of literary contexts , are difficult to catch in the act
the most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians , such as herodotus , who were all greek
ancient greek certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name
the first continental use of asia is attributed to herodotus ( about 440 bce ) , not because he innovated it , but because his histories are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail
he defines it carefully , mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read , but whose works are now missing
by it he means anatolia and the persian empire , in contrast to greece and egypt
herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three womens names were given to a tract which is in reality one ( europa , asia , and libya , referring to africa ) , stating that most greeks assumed that asia was named after the wife of prometheus ( that is hesione ) , but that the lydians say it was named after asies , son of cotys , who passed the name on to a tribe at sardis
in greek mythology , asia ( ἀσία ) or asie ( ἀσίη ) was the name of a nymph or titan goddess of lydia
in ancient greek religion , places were under the care of female divinities , parallel to guardian angels
the poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories , which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical greek drama and became greek mythology
for example , hesiod mentions the daughters of tethys and ocean , among whom are a holy company , who with the lord apollo and the rivers have youths in their keeping
many of these are geographic doris , rhodea , europa , asia
hesiod explains
the iliad ( attributed by the ancient greeks to homer ) mentions two phrygians ( the tribe that replaced the luvians in lydia ) in the trojan war named asios ( an adjective meaning asian ) ; and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in lydia as
according to many muslims , the term came from ancient egypts queen asiya , the adoptive mother of moses
muhmmad al - bukhari
sahih al - bukhari translated into english prose by muhammad muhsin khan
the history of asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions east asia , south asia , southeast asia and the middle east , linked by the interior mass of the central asian steppes
the coastal periphery was home to some of the worlds earliest known civilizations , each of them developing around fertile river valleys
the civilizations in mesopotamia , the indus valley and the yellow river shared many similarities
these civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel
other innovations , such as writing , seem to have been developed individually in each area
cities , states and empires developed in these lowlands
the central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse - mounted nomads who could reach all areas of asia from the steppes
the earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the indo - europeans , who spread their languages into the middle east , south asia , and the borders of china , where the tocharians resided
the northernmost part of asia , including much of siberia , was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads , owing to the dense forests , climate and tundra
these areas remained very sparsely populated
the center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts
the caucasus and himalaya mountains and the karakum and gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty
while the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially , in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe
however , the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force ; for this and other reasons , the nomads who conquered states in china , india , and the middle east often found themselves adapting to the local , more affluent societies
the islamic caliphates defeats of the byzantine and persian empires led to west asia and southern parts of central asia and western parts of south asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century
the mongol empire conquered a large part of asia in the 13th century , an area extending from china to europe
before the mongol invasion , song dynasty reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens ; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people
the black death , one of the most devastating pandemics in human history , is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia , where it then travelled along the silk road
the russian empire began to expand into asia from the 17th century , and would eventually take control of all of siberia and most of central asia by the end of the 19th century
the ottoman empire controlled anatolia , most of the middle east , north africa and the balkans from the mid 16th century onwards
in the 17th century , the manchu conquered china and established the qing dynasty
the islamic mughal empire and the hindu maratha empire controlled much of india in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively
the empire of japan controlled most of east asia and much of southeast asia , new guinea and the pacific islands until the end of world war ii

asia is the largest continent on earth
it covers 9 of the earths total surface area ( or 30 of its land area ) , and has the longest coastline , at it is bounded on the east by the pacific ocean , on the south by the indian ocean and on the north by the arctic ocean
asia is subdivided into 49 countries , five of them ( georgia , azerbaijan , russia , kazakhstan and turkey ) are transcontinental countries lying partly in europe
geographically , russia is partly in asia , but is considered a european nation , both culturally and politically
the gobi desert is in mongolia and the arabian desert stretches across much of the middle east
the yangtze river in china is the longest river in the continent
the himalayas between nepal and china is the tallest mountain range in the world
tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north
there are various approaches to the regional division of asia
the following subdivision into regions is used , among others , by the un statistics agency unsd
this division of asia into regions by the united nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories
asia has extremely diverse climate features
climates range from arctic and subarctic in siberia to tropical in southern india and southeast asia
it is moist across southeast sections , and dry across much of the interior
some of the largest daily temperature ranges on earth occur in western sections of asia
the monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections , due to the presence of the himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer
southwestern sections of the continent are hot
siberia is one of the coldest places in the northern hemisphere , and can act as a source of arctic air masses for north america
the most active place on earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the philippines and south of japan
a survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change
each nations vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio , economic and environmental indicators , which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years
the asian countries of bangladesh , india , the philippines , vietnam , thailand , pakistan , china and sri lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change
some shifts are already occurring
for example , in tropical parts of india with a semi - arid climate , the temperature increased by 0°c between 1901 and 2003
a 2013 study by the international crops research institute for the semi - arid tropics ( icrisat ) aimed to find science - based , pro - poor approaches and techniques that would enable asias agricultural systems to cope with climate change , while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers
the studys recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather - based agro - advisory services , to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover , replenish groundwater and use renewable energy
the ten countries of the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) – brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand , and vietnam – are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the world , however , aseans climate mitigation efforts are not commensurate with the climate threats and risks it faces
asia has the largest continental economy by both gdp nominal and ppp in the world , and is the fastest growing economic region
in the late 1990s and early 2000s , the economies of china and india have been growing rapidly , both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8
other recent very - high - growth nations in asia include israel , malaysia , indonesia , bangladesh , thailand , vietnam , and the philippines , and mineral - rich nations such as kazakhstan , turkmenistan , iran , brunei , the united arab emirates , qatar , kuwait , saudi arabia , bahrain and oman
according to economic historian angus maddison in his book the world economy a millennial perspective , india had the worlds largest economy during 0 bce and 1000 bce
historically , india was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century , contributing 25 of the worlds industrial output
china was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with india
for several decades in the late twentieth century japan was the largest economy in asia and second - largest of any single nation in the world , after surpassing the soviet union ( measured in net material product ) in 1990 and germany in 1968
( nb a number of supernational economies are larger , such as the european union ( eu ) , the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) or apec )
this ended in 2010 when china overtook japan to become the worlds second largest economy
in the late 1980s and early 1990s , japans gdp was almost as large ( current exchange rate method ) as that of the rest of asia combined
it is forecasted that india will overtake japan in terms of nominal gdp by 2025
by 2027 , according to goldman sachs , china will have the largest economy in the world
several trade blocs exist , with the most developed being the association of southeast asian nations
asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin , and it is rich in natural resources , such as petroleum , forests , fish , water , rice , copper and silver
manufacturing in asia has traditionally been strongest in east and southeast asia , particularly in china , taiwan , south korea , japan , india , the philippines , and singapore
japan and south korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations , but increasingly the prc and india are making significant inroads
many companies from europe , north america , south korea and japan have operations in asias developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure
according to citigroup 9 of 11 global growth generators countries came from asia driven by population and income growth
they are bangladesh , china , india , indonesia , iraq , mongolia , the philippines , sri lanka and vietnam
asia has three main financial centers hong kong , tokyo and singapore
call centers and business process outsourcing ( bpos ) are becoming major employers in india and the philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled , english - speaking workers
the increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of india and the china as financial centers
due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry , india has become a major hub for outsourcing
trade between asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for asia
individual main routes have emerged from this
the main route leads from the chinese coast south via hanoi to jakarta , singapore and kuala lumpur through the strait of malacca via the sri lankan colombo to the southern tip of india via malé to east africa mombasa , from there to djibouti , then through the red sea over the suez canal into mediterranean , there via haifa , istanbul and athens to the upper adriatic to the northern italian hub of trieste with its rail connections to central and eastern europe or further to barcelona and around spain and france to the european northern ports
a far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via south africa to europe
a particularly significant part of the asian goods traffic is carried out across the pacific towards los angeles and long beach
in contrast to the sea routes , the silk road via the land route to europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope
intra - asian trade , including sea trade , is growing rapidly
in 2010 , asia had 3 million millionaires ( people with net worth over us1 million excluding their homes ) , slightly below north america with 3 million millionaires
last year asia had toppled europe
citigroup in the wealth report 2012 stated that asian centa - millionaire overtook north americas wealth for the first time as the worlds economic center of gravity continued moving east
at the end of 2011 , there were 18 , 000 asian people mainly in southeast asia , china and japan who have at least 100 million in disposable assets , while north america with 17 , 000 people and western europe with 14 , 000 people
with growing regional tourism with domination of chinese visitors , mastercard has released global destination cities index 2013 with 10 of 20 are dominated by asia and pacific region cities and also for the first time a city of a country from asia ( bangkok ) set in the top - ranked with 15 international visitors
east asia had by far the strongest overall human development index ( hdi ) improvement of any region in the world , nearly doubling average hdi attainment over the past 40 years , according to the reports analysis of health , education and income data
china , the second highest achiever in the world in terms of hdi improvement since
1970 , is the only country on the top 10 movers list due to income rather than health or education achievements
its per capita income increased a stunning 21 - fold over the last four decades , also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty
yet it was not among the regions top performers in improving school enrollment and life expectancy
nepal , a south asian country , emerges as one of the worlds fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements
its present life expectancy is 25 years longer than in the 1970s
more than four of every five children of school age in nepal now attend primary school , compared to just one in five 40 years ago
hong kong ranked highest among the countries grouped on the hdi ( number 7 in the world , which is in the very high human development category ) , followed by singapore ( 9 ) , japan ( 19 ) and south korea ( 22 )
afghanistan ( 155 ) ranked lowest amongst asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed
asia is home to several language families and many language isolates
most asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken
for instance , according to ethnologue , more than 600 languages are spoken in indonesia , more than 800 languages spoken in india , and more than 100 are spoken in the philippines
china has many languages and dialects in different provinces
many of the worlds major religions have their origins in asia , including the five most practiced in the world ( excluding irreligion ) , which are christianity , islam , hinduism , chinese folk religion ( classified as confucianism and taoism ) , and buddhism respectively
asian mythology is complex and diverse
the story of the great flood for example , as presented to jews in the hebrew bible in the narrative of noah—and later to christians in the old testament , and to muslims in the quran—is earliest found in mesopotamian mythology , in the enûma eliš and epic of gilgamesh
hindu mythology similarly tells about an avatar of vishnu in the form of a fish who warned manu of a terrible flood
ancient chinese mythology also tells of a great flood spanning generations , one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control
judaism , the oldest of the abrahamic faiths , is practiced primarily in israel , the indigenous homeland and historical birthplace of the hebrew nation which today consists both of those jews who remained in the middle east and those who returned from diaspora in europe , north america , and other regions ; although the levels of adherence to jewish religion vary
outside of israel there are small ancient jewish communities in turkey ( 17 , 400 ) , azerbaijan ( 9 , 100 ) , see persian jewsiran india ( 5 , 000 ) and uzbekistan ( 4 , 000 ) , jews alive in the world today , making them one of the smallest asian minorities , at roughly 0 to 0 percent of the total population of the continent
christianity is a widespread religion in asia with more than 286 million adherents according to pew research center in 2010 , constituting around 12 of the total population of asia
in the philippines and east timor , roman catholicism is the predominant religion ; it was introduced by the spaniards and the portuguese , respectively
in armenia and georgia , eastern orthodoxy is the predominant religion
in the middle east , such as in the levant , anatolia and fars , syriac christianity ( church of the east ) and oriental orthodoxy are prevalent minority denominations ,
significant christian communities also found in central asia , south asia , southeast asia and east asia
islam , which originated in the hejaz located in modern - day saudi arabia , is the second largest and most widely - spread religion in asia with at least 1 billion muslims constituting around 23 of the total population of asia
with 12 of the world muslim population , the country currently with the largest muslim population in the world is indonesia , followed by pakistan ( 11 ) , india ( 10 ) , bangladesh , iran and turkey
mecca , medina and jerusalem are the three holiest cities for islam in all the world
the hajj and umrah attract large numbers of muslim devotees from all over the world to mecca and medina
iran is the largest shia country
the druze faith or druzism originated in western asia , is a monotheistic religion based on the teachings of figures like hamza ibn - ali ibn - ahmad and al - hakim bi - amr allah , and greek philosophers such as plato and aristotle
the number of druze people worldwide is around one million , with about 45 to 50 live in syria , 35 to 40 live in lebanon , and less than 10 live in israel , with recently there has been a growing druze diaspora
the baháʼí faith originated in asia , in iran ( persia ) , and spread from there to the ottoman empire , central asia , india , and burma during the lifetime of baháulláh
since the middle of the 20th century , growth has particularly occurred in other asian countries , because baháʼí activities in many muslim countries has been severely suppressed by authorities
lotus temple is a big baháʼí temple in india
almost all asian religions have philosophical character and asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings
indian philosophy includes hindu philosophy and buddhist philosophy
they include elements of nonmaterial pursuits , whereas another school of thought from india , cārvāka , preached the enjoyment of the material world
the religions of hinduism , buddhism , jainism and sikhism originated in india , south asia
in east asia , particularly in china and japan , confucianism , taoism and zen buddhism took shape
, hinduism has around 1 billion adherents
the faith represents around 25 of asias population and is the largest religion in asia
however , it is mostly concentrated in south asia
over 80 of the populations of both india and nepal adhere to hinduism , alongside significant communities in bangladesh , pakistan , bhutan , sri lanka and bali , indonesia
many overseas indians in countries such as burma , singapore and malaysia also adhere to hinduism
buddhism has a great following in mainland southeast asia and east asia
buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of cambodia ( 96 ) , burma ( 80–89 ) , bhutan ( 75–84 ) , laos ( 60–67 ) large buddhist populations also exist in singapore ( 33–51 ) , malaysia ( 19–21 ) , vietnam ( 10–75 ) , north korea ( 2–14 ) , and small communities in india and bangladesh

aruba ( , ) is a constituent country of the kingdom of the netherlands physically located in the mid - south of the caribbean sea , about northwest of curaçao
long from its northwestern to its southeastern end and across at its widest point
together with bonaire and curaçao , aruba forms a group referred to as the abc islands
collectively , these and the other three dutch substantial islands in the caribbean are often called the dutch caribbean , of which aruba has about one - third of the population
in 1986 , it became a constituent country within the kingdom of the netherlands , and acquired the formal name the country of aruba
aruba is one of the four countries that form the kingdom of the netherlands , along with the netherlands , curaçao , and sint maarten ; the citizens of these countries are all dutch nationals
aruba has no administrative subdivisions , but , for census purposes , is divided into eight regions
its capital is oranjestad
unlike much of the caribbean region , aruba has a dry climate and an arid , cactus - strewn landscape
the climate has helped tourism , because visitors to the island can expect clear , sunny skies all year
its area is and it is quite densely populated , with 101 , 484 inhabitants as at the 2010 census
a january 2019 estimate of the population placed it at 116 , 600
the name aruba most likely came from the caquetio oruba which means well situated island , seeing as it was the caquetio who were present on the island when it was first set foot upon by alonso de ojeda
between 1529 and the signing of the treaty of westphalia the name isla de oruba was used for the island by the spanish
after the signing the island was ceded to the dutch and its name was changed to aruba
there were many different names for aruba used by other amerindian groups , all of which could have contributed to the present - day name aruba
another caquetio name for the island was oibubia which means guided island
the taino name for the island was arubeira
and oirubae which means companion of curaçao
a common misconception is that the name aruba came from the spanish oro hubo which means there was gold
however the spanish found no gold on aruba during the time of their occupation , nicknaming aruba and the rest of the abc islands islas inútiles , meaning useless islands due to the lack of gold
it was not until much later in 1824 that gold was found on aruba by willem rasmijn , starting the aruban gold rush
another early spanish name for aruba was isla de brasil , named as such because of the many brazilwood trees that grew on the island
there has been a human presence on aruba from as early as circa 2000 bc
archaeological evidence suggests continuing links between these native arubans and amerindian peoples of mainland south america
the first europeans to visit aruba were amerigo vespucci and alonso de ojeda in 1499 , who claimed the island for spain
both men described aruba as an island of giants , remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native caquetíos
vespucci returned to spain with stocks of cotton and brazilwood from the island and described houses built into the ocean
the netherlands seized aruba from spain in 1636 in the course of the thirty years war
peter stuyvesant , later appointed to new amsterdam ( new york ) , was the first dutch governor
those arawak who had survived the depredations of the spanish were allowed to farm and graze livestock , with the dutch using the island as a source of meat for their other possessions in the caribbean
arubas proximity to south america resulted in interactions with the cultures of the coastal areas ; for example , architectural similarities can be seen between the 19th - century parts of oranjestad and the nearby venezuelan city of coro in falcón state
historically , dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of colonial administration ; its use increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries

zutphen de walburg pers students on curaçao , aruba , and bonaire were taught predominantly in spanish until the late 18th century
during the napoleonic wars , the british empire took control of the island , occupying it between 1806 and 1816 , before handing it back to the dutch as per the terms of the anglo - dutch treaty of 1814
aruba subsequently became part of the colony of curaçao and dependencies along with bonaire
during the 19th century , an economy based on gold mining , phosphate production and aloe vera plantations developed , but the island remained a relatively poor backwater
the first oil refinery in aruba was built in 1928 by royal dutch shell
the facility was built just to the west of the capital city , oranjestad , and was commonly called the eagle
immediately following that , another refinery was built by lago oil and transport company , in an area now known as san nicolas on the east end of aruba
the refineries processed crude oil from the vast venezuelan oil fields , bringing greater prosperity to the island
the refinery on aruba grew to become one of the largest in the world
during world war ii , the netherlands was occupied by nazi germany
in 1940 , the oil facilities in aruba came under the administration of the dutch government - in - exile in london , causing them to be attacked by the german navy in 1942
in august 1947 , aruba formulated its first staatsreglement ( constitution ) for arubas status aparte as an autonomous state within the kingdom of the netherlands , prompted by the efforts of henny eman , a noted aruban politician
by 1954 , the charter of the kingdom of the netherlands was established , providing a framework for relations between aruba and the rest of the kingdom
many arubans were unhappy with the arrangement , however , as the new polity was perceived as being dominated by curaçao
in 1972 , at a conference in suriname , betico croes , a politician from aruba , proposed the creation of a dutch commonwealth of four states aruba , the netherlands , suriname , and the netherlands antilles , each to have its own nationality
backed by his newly created party , the movimiento electoral di pueblo , croes sought greater autonomy for aruba , with the long - term goal of independence , adopting the trappings of an independent state in 1976 with the creation of a flag and national anthem
in march 1977 , a referendum was held with the support of the united nations
82 of the participants voted for complete independence from the netherlands
tensions mounted as croes stepped up the pressure on the dutch government by organising a general strike in 1977
croes later met with dutch prime minister joop den uyl , with the two sides agreeing to assign the institute of social studies in the hague to prepare a study for independence , entitled aruba en onafhankelijkheid , achtergronden , modaliteiten , en mogelijkheden ; een rapport in eerste aanleg ( aruba and independence , backgrounds , modalities , and opportunities ; a preliminary report ) ( 1978 )
in march 1983 , aruba reached an official agreement within the kingdom for its independence , to be developed in a series of steps as the crown granted increasing autonomy
in august 1985 , aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved
on 1 january 1986 , after elections were held for its first parliament , aruba seceded from the netherlands antilles , officially becoming a country of the kingdom of the netherlands , with full independence planned for 1996
however , croes was seriously injured in a traffic accident in 1985 , slipping into a coma
he died in 1986 , never seeing the enacting of status aparte for aruba for which he had worked over many years
after his death , croes was proclaimed libertador di aruba
croes successor , henny eman , of the aruban peoples party ( avp ) , became the first prime minister of aruba
in 1985 , arubas oil refinery had closed
it had provided aruba with 30 percent of its real income and 50 percent of government revenue
the significant blow to the economy led to a push for a dramatic increase in tourism , and that sector has expanded to become the islands largest industry
at a convention in the hague in 1990 , at the request of arubas prime minister nelson oduber , the governments of aruba , the netherlands , and the netherlands antilles postponed indefinitely arubas transition to full independence
the article scheduling arubas complete independence was rescinded in 1995 , although it was decided that the process could be revived after another referendum
aruba is a generally flat , riverless island in the leeward antilles island arc of the lesser antilles in the southern part of the caribbean
it lies north of venezuelas paraguaná peninsula
aruba has white sandy beaches on the western and southern coasts of the island , relatively sheltered from fierce ocean currents
this is where the bulk of the population live and where most tourist development has occurred
the northern and eastern coasts , lacking this protection , are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched
the hinterland of the island features some rolling hills , such as hooiberg at above sea level
oranjestad , the capital , is located at
the natural bridge was a large , naturally formed limestone bridge on the islands north shore
it was a popular tourist destination until its collapse in 2005
the island , with a population of about 116 , 600 people ( 1 january 2019 estimate ) does not have major cities
it is divided into six districts
the districts are as follows
the isolation of aruba from the mainland of south america has fostered the evolution of multiple endemic animals
the island provides a habitat for the endemic aruban whiptail and aruba rattlesnake , as well as an endemic subspecies of burrowing owl and brown - throated parakeet
the flora of aruba differs from the typical tropical island vegetation
xeric scrublands are common , with various forms of cacti , thorny shrubs , and evergreens
aloe vera is also present , its economic importance earning it a place on the coat of arms of aruba
cacti like melocactus and opuntia are represented on aruba by species like opuntia stricta
by the köppen climate classification , aruba has a hot semi - arid climate ( köppen bsh )
to in oranjestad , although it is extremely variable and can range from as little as in la niña years like 1933 / 1934 , 1970 / 1971 or 1988 / 1989

in terms of ethnic composition , the population is estimated to be 75 mestizo , 15 black and 10 other ethnicities
most of the population is descended from caquetio indians , african slaves , and dutch settlers , and to a lesser extent the various other groups that have settled on the island over time , such as the spanish , portuguese , english , french , and sephardic jews
recently , there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighbouring south american and caribbean nations , attracted by the higher paid jobs
in 2007 , new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting foreign workers to a maximum of three years residency on the island
to the south
in 2019 , recently arrived venezuelan refugees were estimated to number around 17 , 000 , accounting for some 15 of the islands population
arubas official languages are dutch and papiamento
while dutch is the sole language for all administration and legal matters , papiamento is the predominant language used on aruba
papiamento is a portuguese - and spanish - based creole language , spoken on aruba , bonaire , and curaçao , that also incorporates words from dutch and various west african languages
english and spanish are also spoken , their usage having grown due to tourism
other common languages spoken , based on the size of their community , are portuguese , cantonese , french and german
in recent years , the government of aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of papiamento
although spoken papiamento is fairly similar among the several papiamento - speaking islands , there is a big difference in written papiamento the orthography differs per island , with aruba using etymological spelling , and curaçao and bonaire a phonetic spelling
the book buccaneers of america , first published in 1678 , states through eyewitness account that the natives on aruba spoke spanish already
use of english dates to the early 19th century , when the british took curaçao , aruba , and bonaire
when dutch rule resumed in 1815 , officials already noted wide use of the language
aruba has newspapers published in papiamento diario , bon dia , solo di pueblo , and awe mainta ; english aruba daily , aruba today , and the news ; and dutch amigoe

various protestant denominations are also present on the island
aruba is cartographically split into eight for censuses ; these regions have no administrative function ; some allude to parishes which include a few charitable community facilities
along with the netherlands , curaçao , and sint maarten , aruba is a constituent country of the kingdom of the netherlands , with internal autonomy
matters such as foreign affairs and defense are handled by the netherlands
arubas politics take place within a framework of a 21 - member staten ( parliament ) and an eight - member cabinet ; the statens 21 members are elected by direct , popular vote to serve a four - year term
the governor of aruba is appointed for a six - year term by the monarch , and the prime minister and deputy prime minister are indirectly elected by the staten for four - year terms
aruba was formerly a part of the ( now - defunct ) netherlands antilles ; however , it separated from that entity in 1986 , gaining its own constitution
aruba is designated as a member of the overseas countries and territories ( oct ) and is thus officially not a part of the european union , though aruba can and does receive support from the european development fund
the aruban legal system is based on the dutch model
in aruba , legal jurisdiction lies with the gerecht in eerste aanleg ( court of first instance ) on aruba , the gemeenschappelijk hof van justitie van aruba , curaçao , sint maarten , en van bonaire , sint eustatius en saba ( joint court of justice of aruba , curaçao , sint maarten , and of bonaire , sint eustatius and saba ) and the hoge raad der nederlanden ( supreme court of justice of the netherlands )

the islands economy is dominated by four main industries tourism , aloe export , petroleum refining , and offshore banking
aruba has one of the highest standards of living in the caribbean region
the gdp per capita ( ppp ) for aruba was estimated to be 37 , 500 in 2017
its main trading partners are colombia , the united states , venezuela , and the netherlands
the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are fairly minimal
gold mining was important in the 19th century
aloe was introduced to aruba in 1840 but did not become a big export until 1890
cornelius eman founded aruba aloe balm , and over time the industry became very important to the economy
at one point , two - thirds of the island was covered in aloe vera fields , and aruba became the largest exporter of aloe in the world
the industry continues today , though on a smaller scale
access to biocapacity in aruba is much lower than world average
in 2016 , aruba had 0 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory , much less than the world average of 1 global hectares per person
the official exchange rate of the aruban florin is pegged to the us dollar at 1 florins to us1
this fact , and the majority of tourists being us , means businesses of hotel and resort districts prefer to bank and trade with the consumer in us dollars
aruba is a prosperous country
unemployment is low ( although the government has not published statistics since 2013 ) and per capita income is one of the highest in the caribbean ( approximately 24 , 087 )

until the mid - 1980s , arubas main industry was oil refining
then the refinery was shut down and the islands economy shifted towards tourism
currently , aruba receives about 1 , 235 , 673 ( 2007 ) guests per year , of which three - quarters are americans
tourism is mainly focused on the beaches and the sea
the refinery has been closed and restarted repeatedly during the last decades
in recent years a letter of intent was signed with citgo ( the us subsidiary of the venezuelan state oil company pdvsa ) to explore the possibility of reopening the refinery again
until 2009 , the netherlands granted development aid to aruba
this aid was mainly for law enforcement , education , administrative development , health care and sustainable economic development
this aid was discontinued at arubas request in 2009
since 2015 , however , a form of financial supervision has been reintroduced because arubas debt has risen sharply to over 80 of gdp
aruba also has two free trade zones ( barcadera and bushiri ) , where import and export and the movement of services are tax - free
aruba has a large and well - developed tourism industry , receiving 1 , 082 , 000 tourists who stayed overnight in its territory in 2018
about most tourists are from north america , with a market - share of 73 , followed by latin america with 15 and europe with 8

since 2008 , aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights
there are many luxury and lesser luxury hotels , concentrated mainly on the west coast beaches
in palm beach are the luxury hotels aimed at american tourists
this area is also called highrise - area , because most of the hotels are located in ( by aruban standards ) high - rise buildings
eagle beach , a short distance from palm beach in the direction of oranjestad , offers hotels on a somewhat smaller and more intimate scale in low - rise buildings , hence the name lowrise - area
oranjestad is the port for the many cruise ships that visit aruba
the cruise industry is a very important pillar of tourism in aruba , since during a cruise a large part of the passengers go ashore to visit the island
with 334 cruise calls , aruba received 815 , 161 cruise tourists in 2018
the 2017 / 2018 cruise season brought 102 million to arubas economy
oranjestad is also home to several luxury hotels , upscale shopping malls , tourist - oriented shopping streets , and hospitality facilities
the main street , called caya ( betico ) croes , has been redesigned in recent years , including new paving , new palm trees and a streetcar line for tourists

on 25 january , betico croes birthday is celebrated
dia di san juan is celebrated on 24 june
besides christmas , the religious holy days of the feast of the ascension and good friday are also holidays on the island
the festival of carnaval is also an important one in aruba , as it is in many caribbean and latin american countries
its celebration in aruba started in the 1950s , influenced by the inhabitants from venezuela and the nearby islands ( curaçao , st
vincent , trinidad , barbados , st
maarten , and anguilla ) who came to work for the oil refinery
over the years , the carnival celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of january until the tuesday before ash wednesday , with a large parade on the last sunday of the festivities ( the sunday before ash wednesday )
tourism from the united states has recently increased the visibility of american culture on the island , with such celebrations as halloween in october and thanksgiving day in november
from the beginning of the colonization of the netherlands until the beginning of the 20th century , the architecture in the most inhabited areas of aruba was influenced by the dutch colonial style and also some spanish elements from the catholic missionaries present in aruba who later settled in venezuela as well
after the boom of the oil industry and the tourist sector in the 20th century the architectural style of the island incorporated a more american and international influence
in addition , elements of the art deco style can still be seen in several buildings in san nicolas
therefore , it can be said that the islands architecture is a mixture of spanish , dutch , american and caribbean influences
aruba has four ports barcadera , the main cargo port , paardenbaai , the cruise ship terminal in oranjestad / taratata , commandeurs baai ( commanders bay ) in savaneta , and sint nicolaas baai in san nicolaas

the articles of confederation and perpetual union was an agreement among the 13 original states of the united states of america that served as its first frame of government
it was approved after much debate ( between july 1776 and november 1777 ) by the second continental congress on november 15 , 1777 , and sent to the states for ratification
the articles of confederation came into force on march 1 , 1781 , after ratification by all the states
a guiding principle of the articles was to establish and preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states
the weak central government established by the articles received only those powers which the former colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament
the document provided clearly written rules for how the states league of friendship ( perpetual union ) would be organized
during the ratification process , the congress looked to the articles for guidance as it conducted business , directing the war effort , conducting diplomacy with foreign states , addressing territorial issues and dealing with native american relations
little changed politically once the articles of confederation went into effect , as ratification did little more than legalize what the continental congress had been doing
that body was renamed the congress of the confederation ; but most americans continued to call it the continental congress , since its organization remained the same
as the confederation congress attempted to govern the continually growing american states , delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so
as the governments weaknesses became apparent , especially after shays rebellion , some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling union began asking for changes to the articles
their hope was to create a stronger government
initially , in september 1786 , some states met to address interstate protectionist trade barriers between them
shortly thereafter , as more states became interested in meeting to revise the articles , a meeting was set in philadelphia on may 25 , 1787
this became the constitutional convention
delegates quickly agreed that the defects of the frame of government could not be remedied by altering the articles , and so went beyond their mandate by replacing it with a new constitution
on march 4 , 1789 , the government under the articles was replaced with the federal government under the constitution
the new constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive ( the president ) , courts , and taxing powers
the political push to increase cooperation among the then - loyal colonies began with the albany congress in 1754 and benjamin franklins proposed albany plan , an inter - colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems over the next two decades , some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen ; others would weaken , especially in the degree of loyalty ( or lack thereof ) owed the crown
civil disobedience resulted in coercive and quelling measures , such as the passage of what the colonials referred to as the intolerable acts in the british parliament , and armed skirmishes which resulted in dissidents being proclaimed rebels
these actions eroded the number of crown loyalists ( tories ) among the colonials and , together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the patriot leaders , caused an increasing number of colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country
in 1775 , with events outpacing communications , the second continental congress began acting as the provisional government
it was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution ; a rulebook for how the new nation should function
during the war , congress exercised an unprecedented level of political , diplomatic , military and economic authority
it adopted trade restrictions , established and maintained an army , issued fiat money , created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments
to transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation , the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it
in early 1776 , thomas paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of common sense that the custom of nations demanded a formal declaration of american independence if any european power were to mediate a peace between the americans and great britain
the monarchies of france and spain , in particular , could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch
foreign courts needed to have american grievances laid before them persuasively in a manifesto which could also reassure them that the americans would be reliable trading partners
without such a declaration , paine concluded , the custom of all courts is against us , and will be so , until , by an independence , we take rank with other nations
beyond improving their existing association , the records of the second continental congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations
on june 7 , 1776 , richard henry lee introduced a resolution before the continental congress declaring the colonies independent ; at the same time , he also urged congress to resolve to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign alliances and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states
congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the declaration , a model treaty , and the articles of confederation
the declaration announced the states entry into the international system ; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states ; and the articles of confederation , which established a firm league among the thirteen free and independent states , constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs
on june 12 , 1776 , a day after appointing the committee of five to prepare a draft of the declaration of independence , the second continental congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 with one representative from each colony to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states
the committee was made up of the following individuals
the committee met frequently , and chairman john dickinson presented their results to the congress on july 12 , 1776
afterward , there were long debates on such issues as state sovereignty , the exact powers to be given to congress , whether to have a judiciary , western land claims , and voting procedures
to further complicate work on the constitution , congress was forced to leave philadelphia twice , for baltimore , maryland , in the winter of 1776 , and later for lancaster then york , pennsylvania , in the fall of 1777 , to evade advancing british troops
even so , the committee continued with its work
the final draft of the articles of confederation and perpetual union was completed on november 15 , 1777
consensus was achieved by including language guaranteeing that each state retained its sovereignty , leaving the matter of western land claims in the hands of the individual states , including language stating that votes in congress would be en bloc by state , and establishing a unicameral legislature with limited and clearly delineated powers
the articles of confederation was submitted to the states for ratification in late november 1777
the first state to ratify was virginia on december 16 , 1777 ; 12 states had ratified the articles by february 1779 , 14 months into the process
it would be two years before the maryland general assembly became satisfied that the various states would follow through , and voted to ratify
during this time , congress observed the articles as its de facto frame of government
maryland finally ratified the articles on february 2 , 1781
congress was informed of marylands assent on march 1 , and officially proclaimed the articles of confederation to be the law of the land
the articles of confederation contain a preamble , thirteen articles , a conclusion , and a signatory section
the individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the confederations central government
under the articles , the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national congress , which was empowered to make war and peace , negotiate diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries , and to resolve disputes between the states
the document also stipulates that its provisions shall be inviolably observed by every state and that the union shall be perpetual
grants to the united states in congress assembled the sole and exclusive right and power to determine peace and war ; to exchange ambassadors ; to enter into treaties and alliances , with some provisos ; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water ; to grant letters of marque and reprisal ( documents authorizing privateers ) in times of peace ; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas ; to establish courts for appeals in all cases of captures , but no member of congress may be appointed a judge ; to set weights and measures ( including coins ) , and for congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states
the court will be composed of jointly appointed commissioners or congress shall appoint them
each commissioner is bound by oath to be impartial
the courts decision is final
congress shall regulate the post offices ; appoint officers in the military ; and regulate the armed forces
the united states in congress assembled may appoint a president who shall not serve longer than one year per three - year term of the congress
congress may request requisitions ( demands for payments or supplies ) from the states in proportion with their population , or take credit
congress may not declare war , enter into treaties and alliances , appropriate money , or appoint a commander in chief without nine states assenting
congress shall keep a journal of proceedings and adjourn for periods not to exceed six months
affirms that the confederation will honor all bills of credit incurred , monies borrowed , and debts contracted by congress before the existence of the articles
under the articles , congress had the authority to regulate and fund the continental army , but it lacked the power to compel the states to comply with requests for either troops or funding
this left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding , supplies , and even food
further , although the articles enabled the states to present a unified front when dealing with the european powers , as a tool to build a centralized war - making government , they were largely a failure ; historian bruce chadwick wrote
the continental congress , before the articles were approved , had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life
however congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation , and as the war wound down after the victory at yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor
no progress was made in congress during the winter of 1783–84
general henry knox , who would later become the first secretary of war under the constitution , blamed the weaknesses of the articles for the inability of the government to fund the army
the army had long been supportive of a strong union
as congress failed to act on the petitions , knox wrote to gouverneur morris , four years before the philadelphia convention was convened , as the present constitution is so defective , why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so ; that is , to have a convention of the states to form a better constitution
once the war had been won , the continental army was largely disbanded
a very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against native american attacks
meanwhile , each of the states had an army ( or militia ) , and 11 of them had navies
the wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met
in 1783 , george washington defused the newburgh conspiracy , but riots by unpaid pennsylvania veterans forced congress to leave philadelphia temporarily
the congress from time to time during the revolutionary war requisitioned troops from the states
any contributions were voluntary , and in the debates of 1788 , the federalists ( who supported the proposed new constitution ) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally , and contributed when the continental army protected their states interests
the anti - federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the union and contributed to advance its needs
dougherty ( 2009 ) concludes that generally the states behavior validated the federalist analysis
this helps explain why the articles of confederation needed reforms
the 1783 treaty of paris , which ended hostilities with great britain , languished in congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a quorum so that it could be ratified
afterward , the problem only got worse as congress had no power to enforce attendance
rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of congress at the time , causing difficulties in raising a quorum
the resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many american nationalists , including george washington
many of the most prominent national leaders , such as washington , john adams , john hancock , and benjamin franklin , retired from public life , served as foreign delegates , or held office in state governments ; and for the general public , local government and self - rule seemed quite satisfactory
this served to exacerbate congresss impotence
inherent weaknesses in the confederations frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy
in 1786 , thomas jefferson , concerned over the failure of congress to fund an american naval force to confront the barbary pirates , wrote in a diplomatic correspondence to james monroe that , it will be said there is no money in the treasury
there never will be money in the treasury till the confederacy shows its teeth
furthermore , the 1786 jay–gardoqui treaty with spain also showed weakness in foreign policy
in this treaty , which was never ratified , the united states was to give up rights to use the mississippi river for 25 years , which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the appalachian mountains
finally , due to the confederations military weakness , it could not compel the british army to leave frontier forts which were on american soil — forts which , in 1783 , the british promised to leave , but which they delayed leaving pending implementation of other provisions such as ending action against loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation
this incomplete british implementation of the treaty of paris would later be resolved by the implementation of jays treaty in 1795 after the federal constitution came into force
under the articles of confederation , the central governments power was kept quite limited
the confederation congress could make decisions but lacked enforcement powers
implementation of most decisions , including modifications to the articles , required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures
congress was denied any powers of taxation it could only request money from the states
the states often failed to meet these requests in full , leaving both congress and the continental army chronically short of money
as more money was printed by congress , the continental dollars depreciated
in 1779 , george washington wrote to john jay , who was serving as the president of the continental congress , that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions
he argued that americans should avoid having it said that america had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent or that her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith
the states did not respond with any of the money requested from them
congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and , as a result , all of the states maintained control over their own trade policies
the states and the confederation congress both incurred large debts during the revolutionary war , and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the war
some states paid off their war debts and others did not
federal assumption of the states war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the constitutional convention
nevertheless , the confederation congress did take two actions with long - lasting impact
the land ordinance of 1785 and northwest ordinance created territorial government , set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units , and set aside land in each township for public use
this system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization , as in europe , and it established the precedent by which the national ( later , federal ) government would be sovereign and expand westward—as opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty
the land ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the mississippi river
frontier lands were surveyed into the now - familiar squares of land called the township ( 36 square miles ) , the section ( one square mile ) , and the quarter section ( 160 acres )
this system was carried forward to most of the states west of the mississippi ( excluding areas of texas and california that had already been surveyed and divided up by the spanish empire )
then , when the homestead act was enacted in 1867 , the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler - farmers
the northwest ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims , organized the northwest territory and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states
while it didnt happen under the articles , the land north of the ohio river and west of the ( present ) western border of pennsylvania ceded by massachusetts , connecticut , new york , pennsylvania , and virginia , eventually became the states of ohio , indiana , illinois , michigan , and wisconsin , and the part of minnesota east of the mississippi river
the northwest ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery
new states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states
no new states were admitted to the union under the articles of confederation
the articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the province of quebec ( referred to as canada in the articles ) into the united states if it chose to do so
it did not , and the subsequent constitution carried no such special provision of admission
additionally , ordinances to admit frankland ( later modified to franklin ) , kentucky , and vermont to the union were considered , but none were approved
under the articles of confederation , the presiding officer of congress—referred to in many official records as president of the united states in congress assembled—chaired the committee of the states when congress was in recess , and performed other administrative functions
he was not , however , an executive in the way the later president of the united states is a chief executive , since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of congress
there were 10 presidents of congress under the articles
the first , samuel huntington , had been serving as president of the continental congress since september 28 , 1779
the peace treaty left the united states independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure
the articles envisioned a permanent confederation but granted to the congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced
there was no president , no executive agencies , no judiciary , and no tax base
the absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states , which seldom arrived
although historians generally agree that the articles were too weak to hold the fast - growing nation together , they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue , as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control
by 1783 , with the end of the british blockade , the new nation was regaining its prosperity
however , trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the british and french empires
the ports of the british west indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in british ships
france and spain established similar policies
simultaneously , new manufacturers faced sharp competition from british products which were suddenly available again
political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the revolution
the apparent inability of the congress to redeem the public obligations ( debts ) incurred during the war , or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development , only aggravated a gloomy situation
in 1786–87 , shays rebellion , an uprising of dissidents in western massachusetts against the state court system , threatened the stability of state government
the continental congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency , spawning the expression not worth a continental
congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the states
less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784 , although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone
when john adams went to london in 1785 as the first representative of the united states , he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce
demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty
adams stated it was necessary for the states to confer the power of passing navigation laws to congress , or that the states themselves pass retaliatory acts against great britain
congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws
meanwhile , each state acted individually against great britain to little effect
when other new england states closed their ports to british shipping , connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports
by 1787 congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping
state legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit
land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population
the idea of a convention to revise the articles of confederation grew in favor
alexander hamilton realized while serving as washingtons top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual congress
hamilton led a group of like - minded nationalists , won washingtons endorsement , and convened the annapolis convention in 1786 to petition congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in philadelphia to remedy the long - term crisis
the second continental congress approved the articles for distribution to the states on november 15 , 1777
a copy was made for each state and one was kept by the congress
on november 28 , the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned , and the cover letter , dated november 17 , had only the signatures of henry laurens and charles thomson , who were the president and secretary to the congress
the articles , however , were unsigned , and the date was blank
congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the articles on june 27 , 1778
they ordered a final copy prepared ( the one in the national archives ) , and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification
on july 9 , 1778 , the prepared copy was ready
they dated it and began to sign
they also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed
on that date , delegates present from new hampshire , massachusetts , rhode island , connecticut , new york , pennsylvania , virginia and south carolina signed the articles to indicate that their states had ratified
new jersey , delaware and maryland could not , since their states had not ratified
north carolina and georgia also were unable to sign that day , since their delegations were absent
after the first signing , some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended
for example , john wentworth of new hampshire added his name on august 8
john penn was the first of north carolinas delegates to arrive ( on july 10 ) , and the delegation signed the articles on july 21 , 1778
the other states had to wait until they ratified the articles and notified their congressional delegation
georgia signed on july 24 , new jersey on november 26 , and delaware on february 12 , 1779
maryland refused to ratify the articles until every state had ceded its western land claims chevalier de la luzerne , french minister to the united states , felt that the articles would help strengthen the american government
in 1780 , when maryland requested france provide naval forces in the chesapeake bay for protection from the british ( who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay ) , he indicated that french admiral destouches would do what he could but la luzerne also sharply pressed maryland to ratify the articles , thus suggesting the two issues were related
on february 2 , 1781 , the much - awaited decision was taken by the maryland general assembly in annapolis
as the last piece of business during the afternoon session , among engrossed bills was signed and sealed by governor thomas sim lee in the senate chamber , in the presence of the members of both houses an act to empower the delegates of this state in congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation and perpetual union among the states
the senate then adjourned to the first monday in august next
the decision of maryland to ratify the articles was reported to the continental congress on february 12
the confirmation signing of the articles by the two maryland delegates took place in philadelphia at noon time on march 1 , 1781 , and was celebrated in the afternoon
with these events , the articles were entered into force and the united states of america came into being as a sovereign federal state
congress had debated the articles for over a year and a half , and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years
many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates , and some of the signers had only recently arrived
the articles of confederation and perpetual union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the congress at the same time
roger sherman ( connecticut ) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the united states the continental association , the united states declaration of independence , the articles of confederation and the united states constitution
robert morris ( pennsylvania ) signed three of the great state papers of the united states the united states declaration of independence , the articles of confederation and the united states constitution
john dickinson ( delaware ) , daniel carroll ( maryland ) and gouverneur morris ( new york ) , along with sherman and robert morris , were the only five people to sign both the articles of confederation and the united states constitution ( gouverneur morris represented pennsylvania when signing the constitution )
original parchment pages of the articles of confederation , national archives and records administration
in september 1786 , delegates from five states met at what became known as the annapolis convention to discuss the need for reversing the protectionist interstate trade barriers that each state had erected
at its conclusion , delegates voted to invite all states to a larger convention to be held in philadelphia in 1787
the confederation congress later endorsed this convention for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation
although the states representatives to the constitutional convention in philadelphia were only authorized to amend the articles , delegates held secret , closed - door sessions and wrote a new constitution
the new frame of government gave much more power to the central government , but characterization of the result is disputed
the general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the age of enlightenment , while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships
historian forrest mcdonald , using the ideas of james madison from federalist 39 , described the change this way
in may 1786 , charles pinckney of south carolina proposed that congress revise the articles of confederation
recommended changes included granting congress power over foreign and domestic commerce , and providing means for congress to collect money from state treasuries
unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations , however , and congress failed to reach a consensus
the weakness of the articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states , especially after shays rebellion threatened to topple the state government of massachusetts
historian ralph ketcham commented on the opinions of patrick henry , george mason , and other anti - federalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution
historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787
jillson and wilson ( 1994 ) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms , rules and institutional structures of the congress , and the propensity to divide along sectional lines
rakove identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the confederation
the second group of factors rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the continental congress confronted after 1783 , especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy
finally , the confederations lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means , thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power
when the war ended in 1783 , certain special interests had incentives to create a new merchant state , much like the british state people had rebelled against
in particular , holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims also , manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods , but competition among states made this impossible without a central government
two prominent political leaders in the confederation , john jay of new york and thomas burke of north carolina believed that the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states , to which the states gave their voluntary consent , and until those obligations were fulfilled , neither nullification of the authority of congress , exercising its due powers , nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges
the articles of this confederation shall be inviolably observed by every state , and the union shall be perpetual ; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them ; unless such alteration be agreed to in a congress of the united states , and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every state
on the other hand , article vii of the proposed constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states , without unanimity
the ratification of the conventions of nine states , shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states so ratifying the same
the apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time , and remains a topic of scholarly discussion
in 1788 , james madison remarked ( in federalist no
40 ) that the issue had become moot as this objection… has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention , i dismiss it without further observation
nevertheless , it is a historical and legal question whether opponents of the constitution could have plausibly attacked the constitution on that ground
at the time , there were state legislators who argued that the constitution was not an alteration of the articles of confederation , but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply
modern scholars such as francisco forrest martin agree that the articles of confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it , and thus other states - parties did not have to comply with the articles unanimous consent rule
on july 3 , 1788 , the congress received new hampshires all - important ninth ratification of the proposed constitution , thus , according to its terms , establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states
the following day delegates considered a bill to admit kentucky into the union as a sovereign state
the discussion ended with congress making the determination that , in light of this development , it would be unadvisable to admit kentucky into the union , as it could do so under the articles of confederation only , but not under the constitution
by the end of july 1788 , 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new constitution
congress continued to convene under the articles with a quorum until october
on saturday , september 13 , 1788 , the confederation congress voted the resolve to implement the new constitution , and on monday , september 15 published an announcement that the new constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states , set the first wednesday in january 1789 for appointing electors , set the first wednesday in february 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and vote for a new president , and set the first wednesday of march 1789 as the day for commencing proceedings under the new constitution
on that same september 13 , it determined that new york would remain the national capital
asia minor is an alternative name for anatolia , the westernmost protrusion of asia , comprising the majority of the republic of turkey
the atlantic ocean is the second - largest of the worlds five oceans , with an area of about it covers approximately 20 of earths surface and about 29 of its water surface area
it is known to separate the old world of africa , europe and asia from the new world of the americas in the european perception of the world
the atlantic ocean occupies an elongated , s - shaped basin extending longitudinally between europe and africa to the east , and the americas to the west
as one component of the interconnected world ocean , it is connected in the north to the arctic ocean , to the pacific ocean in the southwest , the indian ocean in the southeast , and the southern ocean in the south ( other definitions describe the atlantic as extending southward to antarctica )
the atlantic ocean is divided in two parts , by the equatorial counter current , with the north ( ern ) atlantic ocean and the south ( ern ) atlantic ocean split at about 8°n
scientific explorations of the atlantic include the challenger expedition , the german meteor expedition , columbia universitys lamont–doherty earth observatory and the united states navy hydrographic office
the oldest known mentions of an atlantic sea come from stesichorus around mid - sixth century bc ( sch
211 ) ; english the atlantic sea ; etym
sea of atlas ) and in the histories of herodotus around 450 bc ( hdt
4 ) ; english sea of atlas or the atlantic sea in these uses , the name refers to atlas , the titan in greek mythology , who supported the heavens and who later appeared as a frontispiece in medieval maps and also lent his name to modern atlases
in contrast , the term atlantic originally referred specifically to the atlas mountains in morocco and the sea off the strait of gibraltar and the north african coast
the greek word has been reused by scientists for the huge panthalassa ocean that surrounded the supercontinent pangaea hundreds of millions of years ago
the term aethiopian ocean , derived from ancient ethiopia , was applied to the southern atlantic as late as the mid - 19th century

the pond is a term often used by british and american speakers in reference to the northern atlantic ocean , as a form of meiosis , or ironic understatement
it is used mostly when referring to events or circumstances on this side of the pond or on the other side of the pond , rather than to discuss the ocean itself
the international hydrographic organization ( iho ) defined the limits of the oceans and seas in 1953 , but some of these definitions have been revised since then and some are not used by various authorities , institutions , and countries , see for example the cia world factbook
correspondingly , the extent and number of oceans and seas vary
the atlantic ocean is bounded on the west by north and south america
it connects to the arctic ocean through the denmark strait , greenland sea , norwegian sea and barents sea
to the east , the boundaries of the ocean proper are europe the strait of gibraltar ( where it connects with the mediterranean sea—one of its marginal seas—and , in turn , the black sea , both of which also touch upon asia ) and africa
in the southeast , the atlantic merges into the indian ocean
the 20° east meridian , running south from cape agulhas to antarctica defines its border
in the 1953 definition it extends south to antarctica , while in later maps it is bounded at the 60° parallel by the southern ocean
the atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays , gulfs and seas
these include the baltic sea , black sea , caribbean sea , davis strait , denmark strait , part of the drake passage , gulf of mexico , labrador sea , mediterranean sea , north sea , norwegian sea , almost all of the scotia sea , and other tributary water bodies
compared to
including its marginal seas , the atlantic covers an area of or 23 of the total volume of the earths oceans
excluding its marginal seas , the atlantic covers
the north atlantic covers ( 11 )
and the maximum depth , the milwaukee deep in the puerto rico trench , is
the bathymetry of the atlantic is dominated by a submarine mountain range called the mid - atlantic ridge ( mar )
it runs from 87°n or
the mar divides the atlantic longitudinally into two halves , in each of which a series of basins are delimited by secondary , transverse ridges
the mar reaches above
the mar is intersected by two perpendicular ridges the azores–gibraltar transform fault , the boundary between the nubian and eurasian plates , intersects the mar at the azores triple junction , on either side of the azores microplate , near the 40°n
in the 1870s , the challenger expedition discovered parts of what is now known as the mid - atlantic ridge , or
the exploration of the mar in the 1950s led to the general acceptance of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics
most of the mar runs under water but where it reaches the surfaces it has produced volcanic islands
while nine of these have collectively been nominated a world heritage site for their geological value , four of them are considered of outstanding universal value based on their cultural and natural criteria þingvellir , iceland ; landscape of the pico island vineyard culture , portugal ; gough and inaccessible islands , united kingdom ; and brazilian atlantic islands fernando de noronha and atol das rocas reserves , brazil
continental shelves in the atlantic are wide off newfoundland , southernmost south america , and north - eastern europe
in the western atlantic carbonate platforms dominate large areas , for example , the blake plateau and bermuda rise
the atlantic is surrounded by passive margins except at a few locations where active margins form deep trenches the puerto rico trench in the south atlantic
there are numerous submarine canyons off north - eastern north america , western europe , and north - western africa
some of these canyons extend along the continental rises and farther into the abyssal plains as deep - sea channels
in 1922 , a historic moment in cartography and oceanography occurred
the uss stewart used a navy sonic depth finder to draw a continuous map across the bed of the atlantic
this involved little guesswork because the idea of sonar is straightforward with pulses being sent from the vessel , which bounce off the ocean floor , then return to the vessel
the deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps , abyssal plains , trenches , seamounts , basins , plateaus , canyons , and some guyots
various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11 of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise
surface water temperatures , which vary with latitude , current systems , and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy , range from below
maximum temperatures occur north of the equator , and minimum values are found in the polar regions
in the middle latitudes , the area of maximum temperature variations , values may vary by
from october to june the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the labrador sea , denmark strait , and baltic sea
the coriolis effect circulates north atlantic water in a clockwise direction , whereas south atlantic water circulates counter - clockwise
the south tides in the atlantic ocean are semi - diurnal ; that is , two high tides occur every 24 lunar hours
in latitudes above 40° north some east–west oscillation , known as the north atlantic oscillation , occurs
on average , the atlantic is the saltiest major ocean ; surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand ( 3–3 ) by mass and varies with latitude and season
evaporation , precipitation , river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values
although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator ( because of heavy tropical rainfall ) , in general , the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter
maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south , in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation
the high surface salinity in the atlantic , on which the atlantic thermohaline circulation is dependent , is maintained by two processes the agulhas leakage / rings , which brings salty indian ocean waters into the south atlantic , and the atmospheric bridge , which evaporates subtropical atlantic waters and exports it to the pacific
the atlantic ocean consists of four major , upper water masses with distinct temperature and salinity
the atlantic subarctic upper water in the northernmost north atlantic is the source for subarctic intermediate water and north atlantic intermediate water
north atlantic central water can be divided into the eastern and western north atlantic central water since the western part is strongly affected by the gulf stream and therefore the upper layer is closer to underlying fresher subpolar intermediate water
the eastern water is saltier because of its proximity to mediterranean water
north atlantic central water flows into south atlantic central water at 15°n
there are five intermediate waters four low - salinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one high - salinity formed through evaporation
arctic intermediate water , flows from north to become the source for north atlantic deep water south of the greenland - scotland sill
these two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins
the wide range of salinities in the north atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources labrador sea , norwegian - greenland sea , mediterranean , and south atlantic intermediate water
the north atlantic deep water ( nadw ) is a complex of four water masses , two that form by deep convection in the open ocean— classical and upper labrador sea water— and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the greenland - iceland - scotland sill— denmark strait and iceland - scotland overflow water
along its path across earth the composition of the nadw is affected by other water masses , especially antarctic bottom water and mediterranean overflow water
the nadw is fed by a flow of warm shallow water into the northern north atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in europe
changes in the formation of nadw have been linked to global climate changes in the past
since man - made substances were introduced into the environment , the path of the nadw can be traced throughout its course by measuring tritium and radiocarbon from nuclear weapon tests in the 1960s and cfcs
the clockwise warm - water north atlantic gyre occupies the northern atlantic , and the counter - clockwise warm - water south atlantic gyre appears in the southern atlantic
in the north atlantic , surface circulation is dominated by three inter - connected currents the gulf stream which flows north - east from the north american coast at cape hatteras ; the north atlantic current , a branch of the gulf stream which flows northward from the grand banks ; and the subpolar front , an extension of the north atlantic current , a wide , vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre
this system of currents transport warm water into the north atlantic , without which temperatures in the north atlantic and europe would plunge dramatically
north of the north atlantic gyre , the cyclonic north atlantic subpolar gyre plays a key role in climate variability
it is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography , rather than being steered by wind , both in the deep ocean and at sea level
the subpolar gyre forms an important part of the global thermohaline circulation
its eastern portion includes eddying branches of the north atlantic current which transport warm , saline waters from the subtropics to the north - eastern atlantic
there this water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of greenland where they form an intense ( 40–50sv ) current which flows around the continental margins of the labrador sea
a third of this water becomes part of the deep portion of the north atlantic deep water ( nadw )
the nadw , in its turn , feeds the meridional overturning circulation ( moc ) , the northward heat transport of which is threatened by anthropogenic climate change
large variations in the subpolar gyre on a decade - century scale , associated with the north atlantic oscillation , are especially pronounced in labrador sea water , the upper layers of the moc
the south atlantic is dominated by the anti - cyclonic southern subtropical gyre
the south atlantic central water originates in this gyre , while antarctic intermediate water originates in the upper layers of the circumpolar region , near the drake passage and the falkland islands
both these currents receive some contribution from the indian ocean
on the african east coast , the small cyclonic angola gyre lies embedded in the large subtropical gyre
the southern subtropical gyre is partly masked by a wind - induced ekman layer
the residence time of the gyre is 4–8years
north atlantic deep water flows southward below the thermocline of the subtropical gyre
the sargasso sea in the western north atlantic can be defined as the area where two species of sargassum ( fluitans and natans ) float , an area
other species endemic to the sargasso sea include the sargassum fish , a predator with algae - like appendages which hovers motionless among the sargassum
fossils of similar fishes have been found in fossil bays of the former tethys ocean , in what is now the carpathian region , that were similar to the sargasso sea
it is possible that the population in the sargasso sea migrated to the atlantic as the tethys closed at the end of the miocene around 17ma
the origin of the sargasso fauna and flora remained enigmatic for centuries
the fossils found in the carpathians in the mid - 20th century often called the quasi - sargasso assemblage , finally showed that this assemblage originated in the carpathian basin from where it migrated over sicily to the central atlantic where it evolved into modern species of the sargasso sea
the location of the spawning ground for european eels remained unknown for decades
in the early 19th century it was discovered that the southern sargasso sea is the spawning ground for both the european and american eel and that the former migrate more than
ocean currents such as the gulf stream transport eel larvae from the sargasso sea to foraging areas in north america , europe , and northern africa
climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds
because of the oceans great capacity to store and release heat , maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates
precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures
the oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation
climatic zones vary with latitude ; the warmest zones stretch across the atlantic north of the equator
the coldest zones are in high latitudes , with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice
ocean currents influence the climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions
the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas
the gulf stream and its northern extension towards europe , the north atlantic drift is thought to have at least some influence on climate
for example , the gulf stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern north america , keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas
the gulf stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the florida peninsula
in the higher latitudes , the north atlantic drift , warms the atmosphere over the oceans , keeping the british isles and north - western europe mild and cloudy , and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude
the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern canada ( the grand banks of newfoundland area ) and africas north - western coast
in general , winds transport moisture and air over land areas
every winter , the icelandic low produces frequent storms icebergs are common from early february to the end of july across the shipping lanes near the grand banks of newfoundland
the ice season is longer in the polar regions , but there is little shipping in those areas
hurricanes are a hazard in the western parts of the north atlantic during the summer and autumn
due to a consistently strong wind shear and a weak intertropical convergence zone , south atlantic tropical cyclones are rare
the atlantic ocean is underlain mostly by dense mafic oceanic crust made up of basalt and gabbro and overlain by fine clay , silt and siliceous ooze on the abyssal plain
the continental margins and continental shelf mark lower density , but greater thickness felsic continental rock that is often much older than that of the seafloor
the oldest oceanic crust in the atlantic is up to 145 million years and situated off the west coast of africa and east coast of north america , or on either side of the south atlantic
in many places , the continental shelf and continental slope are covered in thick sedimentary layers
for instance , on the north american side of the ocean , large carbonate deposits formed in warm shallow waters such as florida and the bahamas , while coarse river outwash sands and silt are common in shallow shelf areas like the georges bank
coarse sand , boulders , and rocks were transported into some areas , such as off the coast of nova scotia or the gulf of maine during the pleistocene ice ages
the break - up of pangaea began in the central atlantic , between north america and northwest africa , where rift basins opened during the late triassic and early jurassic
this period also saw the first stages of the uplift of the atlas mountains
the exact timing is controversial with estimates ranging from 200 to 170ma
the opening of the atlantic ocean coincided with the initial break - up of the supercontinent pangaea , both of which were initiated by the eruption of the central atlantic magmatic province ( camp ) , one of the most extensive and voluminous large igneous provinces in earths history associated with the triassic–jurassic extinction event , one of earths major extinction events
theoliitic dikes , sills , and lava flows from the camp eruption at 200ma have been found in west africa , eastern north america , and northern south america
the extent of the volcanism has been estimated to covered what is now northern and central brazil
the formation of the central american isthmus closed the central american seaway at the end of the pliocene 2ma ago
the formation of the isthmus resulted in the migration and extinction of many land - living animals , known as the great american interchange , but the closure of the seaway resulted in a great american schism as it affected ocean currents , salinity , and temperatures in both the atlantic and pacific
marine organisms on both sides of the isthmus became isolated and either diverged or went extinct
geologically , the northern atlantic is the area delimited to the south by two conjugate margins , newfoundland and iberia , and to the north by the arctic eurasian basin
the opening of the northern atlantic closely followed the margins of its predecessor , the iapetus ocean , and spread from the central atlantic in six stages iberia–newfoundland , porcupine–north america , eurasia–greenland , eurasia–north america
active and inactive spreading systems in this area are marked by the interaction with the iceland hotspot
seafloor spreading led to the extension of the crust and formations of troughs and sedimentary basins
the rockall trough opened between 105 and 84 million years ago although along the rift failed along with one leading into the bay of biscay
spreading began opening the labrador sea around 61 million years ago , continuing until 36 million years ago
geologists distinguish two magmatic phases
one from 62 to 58 million years ago predates the separation of greenland from northern europe while the second from 56 to 52 million years ago happened as the separation occurred
iceland began to form 62 million years ago due to a particularly concentrated mantle plume
large quantities of basalt erupted at this time period are found on baffin island , greenland , the faroe islands , and scotland , with ash falls in western europe acting as a stratigraphic marker
the north atlantic ocean contains about 810 seamounts , most of them situated along the mid - atlantic ridge
the ospar database ( convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north - east atlantic ) mentions 104 seamounts 74 within the national exclusive economic zone
of these seamounts , 46 are located close to the iberian peninsula
west gondwana ( south america and africa ) broke up in the early cretaceous to form the south atlantic
the apparent fit between the coastlines of the two continents was noted on the first maps that included the south atlantic and it was also the subject of the first computer - assisted plate tectonic reconstructions in 1965
this magnificent fit , however , has since then proven problematic and later reconstructions have introduced various deformation zones along the shorelines to accommodate the northward - propagating break - up
intra - continental rifts and deformations have also been introduced to subdivide both continental plates into sub - plates
geologically the south atlantic can be divided into four segments equatorial segment , from 10°n to the romanche fracture zone ( rfz ) ; central segment , from rfz to florianopolis fracture zone ( ffz , north of walvis ridge and rio grande rise ) ; southern segment , from ffz to the agulhas - falkland fracture zone ( affz ) ; and falkland segment , south of affz
in the southern segment the early cretaceous ( 133–130ma ) intensive magmatism of the paraná–etendeka large igneous province produced by the tristan hotspot resulted in an estimated volume of in brazil , paraguay , and uruguay and in africa
dyke swarms in brazil , angola , eastern paraguay , and namibia , however , suggest the lip originally covered a much larger area and also indicate failed rifts in all these areas
associated offshore basaltic flows reach as far south as the falkland islands and south africa
traces of magmatism in both offshore and onshore basins in the central and southern segments have been dated to 147–49ma with two peaks between 143 and 121ma and 90–60ma
in the falkland segment rifting began with dextral movements between the patagonia and colorado sub - plates between the early jurassic ( 190ma ) and the early cretaceous ( 126ma )
around 150ma sea - floor spreading propagated northward into the southern segment
no later than 130ma rifting had reached the walvis ridge–rio grande rise
in the central segment rifting started to break africa in two by opening the benue trough around 118ma
rifting in the central segment , however , coincided with the cretaceous normal superchron ( also known as the cretaceous quiet period ) , a 40ma period without magnetic reversals , which makes it difficult to date sea - floor spreading in this segment
the equatorial segment is the last phase of the break - up , but , because it is located on the equator , magnetic anomalies cannot be used for dating
various estimates date the propagation of sea - floor spreading in this segment to the period 120–96ma
this final stage , nevertheless , coincided with or resulted in the end of continental extension in africa
about 50ma the opening of the drake passage resulted from a change in the motions and separation rate of the south american and antarctic plates
first small ocean basins opened and a shallow gateway appeared during the middle eocene
34–30ma a deeper seaway developed , followed by an eocene–oligocene climatic deterioration and the growth of the antarctic ice sheet
an embryonic subduction margin is potentially developing west of gibraltar
the gibraltar arc in the western mediterranean is migrating westward into the central atlantic where it joins the converging african and eurasian plates
together these three tectonic forces are slowly developing into a new subduction system in the eastern atlantic basin
meanwhile , the scotia arc and caribbean plate in the western atlantic basin are eastward - propagating subduction systems that might , together with the gibraltar system , represent the beginning of the closure of the atlantic ocean and the final stage of the atlantic wilson cycle
humans evolved in africa ; first by diverging from other apes around 7mya ; then developing stone tools around 2mya ; to finally evolve as modern humans around 200kya
the earliest evidence for the complex behavior associated with this behavioral modernity has been found in the greater cape floristic region ( gcfr ) along the coast of south africa
during the latest glacial stages , the now - submerged plains of the agulhas bank were exposed above sea level , extending the south african coastline farther south by hundreds of kilometers
a small population of modern humans— probably fewer than a thousand reproducing individuals— survived glacial maxima by exploring the high diversity offered by these palaeo - agulhas plains
the gcfr is delimited to the north by the cape fold belt and the limited space south of it resulted in the development of social networks out of which complex stone age technologies emerged
the african origin of this modern behaviour is evidenced by 70 , 000 years - old engravings from blombos cave , south africa
mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) studies indicate that 80–60 , 000 years ago a major demographic expansion within africa , derived from a single , small population , coincided with the emergence of behavioral complexity and the rapid mis5–4 environmental changes
this group of people not only expanded over the whole of africa , but also started to disperse out of africa into asia , europe , and australasia around 65 , 000 years ago and quickly replaced the archaic humans in these regions
the european coasts of the north atlantic were permanently populated about 9–8 thousand years ago
this human dispersal left abundant traces along the coasts of the atlantic ocean
50kya - old , deeply stratified shell middens found in ysterfontein on the western coast of south africa are associated with the middle stone age ( msa )
the msa population was small and dispersed and the rate of their reproduction and exploitation was less intense than those of later generations
while their middens resemble 12–11kya - old late stone age ( lsa ) middens found on every inhabited continent , the 50–45kya - old enkapune ya muto in kenya probably represents the oldest traces of the first modern humans to disperse out of africa
the same development can be seen in europe
in la riera cave ( 23–13kya ) in asturias , spain , only some 26 , 600 molluscs were deposited over 10kya
in contrast , 8–7kya - old shell middens in portugal , denmark , and brazil generated thousands of tons of debris and artefacts
the ertebølle middens in denmark , for example , accumulated
during the lgm the laurentide ice sheet covered most of northern north america while beringia connected siberia to alaska
in 1973 , late american geoscientist paul martin proposed a blitzkrieg colonization of the americas by which clovis hunters migrated into north america around 13 , 000 years ago in a single wave through an ice - free corridor in the ice sheet and spread southward explosively , briefly attaining a density sufficiently large to overkill much of their prey
these hypotheses remained the long - held view regarding the settlement of the americas , a view challenged by more recent archaeological discoveries the oldest archaeological sites in the americas have been found in south america ; sites in north - east siberia report virtually no human presence there during the lgm ; and most clovis artefacts have been found in eastern north america along the atlantic coast
a proposed route across the pacific to south america could explain early south american finds and another hypothesis proposes a northern path , through the canadian arctic and down the north american atlantic coast
early settlements across the atlantic have been suggested by alternative theories , ranging from purely hypothetical to mostly disputed , including the solutrean hypothesis and some of the pre - columbian trans - oceanic contact theories
the norse settlement of the faroe islands and iceland began during the 9th and 10th centuries
a settlement on greenland was established before 1000ce , but contact with it was lost in 1409 and it was finally abandoned during the early little ice age
this setback was caused by a range of factors an unsustainable economy resulted in erosion and denudation , while conflicts with the local inuit resulted in the failure to adapt their arctic technologies ; a colder climate resulted in starvation , and the colony got economically marginalized as the great plague and barbary pirates harvested its victims on iceland in the 15th century
iceland was initially settled 865–930ce following a warm period when winter temperatures hovered around
the landnámabók ( book of settlement ) records disastrous famines during the first century of settlement— men ate foxes and ravens and the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs— and by the early 1200s hay had to be abandoned for short - season crops such as barley
christopher columbus reached the americas in 1492 under spanish flag
six years later vasco da gama reached india under the portuguese flag , by navigating south around the cape of good hope , thus proving that the atlantic and indian oceans are connected
in 1500 , in his voyage to india following vasco da gama , pedro alvares cabral reached brazil , taken by the currents of the south atlantic gyre
following these explorations , spain and portugal quickly conquered and colonized large territories in the new world and forced the amerindian population into slavery in order to explore the vast quantities of silver and gold they found
spain and portugal monopolized this trade in order to keep other european nations out , but conflicting interests nevertheless led to a series of spanish - portuguese wars
a peace treaty mediated by the pope divided the conquered territories into spanish and portuguese sectors while keeping other colonial powers away
england , france , and the dutch republic enviously watched the spanish and portuguese wealth grow and allied themselves with pirates such as henry mainwaring and alexandre exquemelin
they could explore the convoys leaving the americas because prevailing winds and currents made the transport of heavy metals slow and predictable
in the colonies of the americas , depredation , smallpox and others diseases , and slavery quickly reduced the indigenous population of the americas to the extent that the atlantic slave trade had to be introduced to replace them— a trade that became the norm and an integral part of the colonization
between the 15th century and 1888 , when brazil became the last part of the americas to end the slave trade , an estimated ten million africans were exported as slaves , most of them destined for agricultural labour
the slave trade was officially abolished in the british empire and the united states in 1808 , and slavery itself was abolished in the british empire in 1838 and in the united states in 1865 after the civil war
from columbus to the industrial revolution trans - atlantic trade , including colonialism and slavery , became crucial for western europe
for european countries with direct access to the atlantic ( including britain , france , the netherlands , portugal , and spain ) 1500–1800 was a period of sustained growth during which these countries grew richer than those in eastern europe and asia
colonialism evolved as part of the trans - atlantic trade , but this trade also strengthened the position of merchant groups at the expense of monarchs
growth was more rapid in non - absolutist countries , such as britain and the netherlands , and more limited in absolutist monarchies , such as portugal , spain , and france , where profit mostly or exclusively benefited the monarchy and its allies
trans - atlantic trade also resulted in increasing urbanization in european countries facing the atlantic , urbanization grew from 8 in 1300 , 10 in 1500 , to 24 in 1850 ; in other european countries from 10 in 1300 , 11 in 1500 , to 17 in 1850
likewise , gdp doubled in atlantic countries but rose by only 30 in the rest of europe
by end of the 17th century , the volume of the trans - atlantic trade had surpassed that of the mediterranean trade
the atlantic ocean became the scene of one of the longest continuous naval military camapaigns throughout world war ii , from 1939 to 1945
the atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries
besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes , the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves
the atlantic harbors petroleum and gas fields , fish , marine mammals ( seals and whales ) , sand and gravel aggregates , placer deposits , polymetallic nodules , and precious stones
gold deposits are a mile or two under water on the ocean floor , however , the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through
currently , there is no cost - effective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make a profit
various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills , marine debris , and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea
the shelves of the atlantic hosts one of the worlds richest fishing resources
the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland , the scotian shelf , georges bank off cape cod , the bahama banks , the waters around iceland , the irish sea , the bay of fundy , the dogger bank of the north sea , and the falkland banks
fisheries have , however , undergone significant changes since the 1950s and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the atlantic fisheries in the eastern central and south - west atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value , the rest of the atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks
the third group , continuously increasing trend since 1950 , is only found in the indian ocean and western pacific
in the north - east atlantic total catches decreased between the mid - 1970s and the 1990s and reached 8 million tons in 2013
blue whiting reached a 2 million tons peak in 2004 but was down to 628 , 000 tons in 2013
recovery plans for cod , sole , and plaice have reduced mortality in these species
arctic cod reached its lowest levels in the 1960s–1980s but is now recovered
arctic saithe and haddock are considered fully fished ; sand eel is overfished as was capelin which has now recovered to fully fished
limited data makes the state of redfishes and deep - water species difficult to assess but most likely they remain vulnerable to overfishing
stocks of northern shrimp and norwegian lobster are in good condition
in the north - east atlantic 21 of stocks are considered overfished
in the north - west atlantic landings have decreased from 4 million tons in the early 1970s to 1 million tons in 2013
during the 21st century some species have shown weak signs of recovery , including greenland halibut , yellowtail flounder , atlantic halibut , haddock , spiny dogfish , while other stocks shown no such signs , including cod , witch flounder , and redfish
stocks of invertebrates , in contrast , remain at record levels of abundance
31 of stocks are overfished in the north - west atlantic
in 1497 , john cabot became the first western european since the vikings to explore mainland north america and one of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of atlantic cod off newfoundland
referred to as newfoundland currency this discovery yielded some 200million tons of fish over five centuries
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock , mackerel , and lobster
from the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of european and asian distant - water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and the number of exploited species
it also expanded the exploited areas from near - shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep - water species such as redfish , greenland halibut , witch flounder , and grenadiers
overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but , because this was occurring on international waters , it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made
in the early 1990s , this finally resulted in the collapse of the atlantic northwest cod fishery
the population of a number of deep - sea fishes also collapsed in the process , including american plaice , redfish , and greenland halibut , together with flounder and grenadier
in the eastern central atlantic small pelagic fishes constitute about 50 of landings with sardine reaching 0–1 million tons per year
pelagic fish stocks are considered fully fished or overfished , with sardines south of cape bojador the notable exception
almost half of the stocks are fished at biologically unsustainable levels
total catches have been fluctuating since the 1970s ; reaching 3 million tons in 2013 or slightly less than the peak production in 2010
in the western central atlantic , catches have been decreasing since 2000 and reached 1 million tons in 2013
the most important species in the area , gulf menhaden , reached a million tons in the mid - 1980s but only half a million tons in 2013 and is now considered fully fished
round sardinella was an important species in the 1990s but is now considered overfished
groupers and snappers are overfished and northern brown shrimp and american cupped oyster are considered fully fished approaching overfished
44 of stocks are being fished at unsustainable levels
in the south - east atlantic catches have decreased from 3 million tons in the early 1970s to 1 million tons in 2013
horse mackerel and hake are the most important species , together representing almost half of the landings
off south africa and namibia deep - water hake and shallow - water cape hake have recovered to sustainable levels since regulations were introduced in 2006 and the states of southern african pilchard and anchovy have improved to fully fished in 2013
in the south - west atlantic , a peak was reached in the mid - 1980s and catches now fluctuate between 1 and 2 million tons
the most important species , the argentine shortfin squid , which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value , is considered fully fished to overfished
another important species was the brazilian sardinella , with a production of 100 , 000 tons in 2013 it is now considered overfished
half the stocks in this area are being fished at unsustainable levels whiteheads round herring has not yet reached fully fished but cunene horse mackerel is overfished
the sea snail perlemoen abalone is targeted by illegal fishing and remain overfished
endangered marine species include the manatee , seals , sea lions , turtles , and whales
drift net fishing can kill dolphins , albatrosses and other seabirds ( petrels , auks ) , hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes
marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles
the biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste
the excess of oxygen - depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone
marine debris , which is also known as marine litter , describes human - created waste floating in a body of water
oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines , frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter
the north atlantic garbage patch is estimated to be hundreds of kilometers across in size
other pollution concerns include agricultural and municipal waste
municipal pollution comes from the eastern united states , southern brazil , and eastern argentina ; oil pollution in the caribbean sea , gulf of mexico , lake maracaibo , mediterranean sea , and north sea ; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the baltic sea , north sea , and mediterranean sea
a usaf c - 124 aircraft from dover air force base , delaware was carrying three nuclear bombs over the atlantic ocean when it experienced a loss of power
for their own safety , the crew jettisoned two nuclear bombs , which were never recovered
north atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature ( sst ) at tropical latitudes , changes that can be attributed to either the natural atlantic multidecadal oscillation ( amo ) or to anthropogenic climate change
a 2005 report indicated that the atlantic meridional overturning circulation ( amoc ) slowed down by 30 between 1957 and 2004
the ocean mixed layer plays an important role in heat storage over seasonal and decadal time - scales , whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and have a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer
this heat uptake provides a time - lag for climate change but it also results in thermal expansion of the oceans which contributes to sea level rise
21st - century global warming will probably result in an equilibrium sea - level rise five times greater than today , whilst melting of glaciers , including that of the greenland ice - sheet , expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century , will probably result in a sea - level rise of 3–6m over a millennium
in das wesen der philosophie , shows a large debt to schopenhauer
like his great forebear , dilthey believed that philosophy had first and foremost an ethical function , that its main purpose was to address the puzzle of the world
arthur schopenhauer ( , building on the transcendental idealism of immanuel kant , schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that rejected the contemporaneous ideas of german idealism

though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his lifetime , schopenhauer had a posthumous impact across various disciplines , including philosophy , literature , and science

arthur schopenhauer was born on february 22 , 1788 , in danzig ( then part of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth ; present - day gdańsk , poland ) on heiligegeistgasse ( present day św
ducha 47 ) , the son of johanna schopenhauer ( née trosiener ; 1766–1838 ) and heinrich floris schopenhauer ( 1747–1805 ) , neither of them was very religious ; both supported the french revolution , and were republicans , cosmopolitans and anglophiles
cartwright ( 2010 )
9 when danzig became part of prussia in 1793 , heinrich moved to hamburg—a free city with a republican constitution
his firm continued trading in danzig where most of their extended families remained
adele , arthurs only sibling , was born on july 12 , 1797
in 1797 , arthur was sent to le havre to live with the family of his fathers business associate , grégoire de blésimaire
he seemed to enjoy his two - year stay there , learning to speak french and fostering a life - long friendship with jean anthime grégoire de blésimaire
as early as 1799 , arthur started playing the flute
in 1803 , he accompanied his parents on a european tour of holland , britain , france , switzerland , austria and prussia
viewed as primarily a pleasure tour , heinrich used the opportunity to visit some of his business associates abroad
heinrich offered arthur a choice he could stay at home and start preparations for university , or he could travel with them and continue his merchant education
arthur chose to travel with them
he deeply regretted his choice later because the merchant training was very tedious
he spent twelve weeks of the tour attending school in wimbledon , where he was disillusioned by strict and intellectually shallow anglican religiosity
he continued to sharply criticize anglican religiosity later in life despite his general anglophilia
he was also under pressure from his father , who became very critical of his educational results
in 1805 , heinrich drowned in a canal near their home in hamburg
although it was possible that his death was accidental , his wife and son believed that it was suicide
he was prone to anxiety and depression ; each becoming more pronounced later in his life
heinrich had become so fussy , even his wife started to doubt his mental health
cartwright ( 2010 )
43 there was , in the fathers life , some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in hamburg
arthur showed similar moodiness during his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father
there were other instances of serious mental health history on his fathers side of the family
despite his hardship , schopenhauer liked his father and later referred to him in a positive light
heinrich schopenhauer left the family with a significant inheritance that was split in three among johanna and the children
arthur schopenhauer was entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority
he invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of a university professor
after quitting his merchant apprenticeship , with some encouragement from his mother , he dedicated himself to studies at the ernestine gymnasium , gotha , in saxe - gotha - altenburg
while there , he also enjoyed social life among the local nobility , spending large amounts of money , which deeply concerned his frugal mother
he left the gymnasium after writing a satirical poem about one of the schoolmasters
although arthur claimed that he left voluntarily , his mothers letter indicates that he may have been expelled

arthur spent two years as a merchant in honor of his dead father
during this time , he had doubts about being able to start a new life as a scholar
most of his prior education was as a practical merchant and he had trouble learning latin ; a prerequisite for an academic career
his mother moved away , with her daughter adele , to weimar—then the centre of german literature—to enjoy social life among writers and artists
arthur and his mother did not part on good terms in one letter , she wrote you are unbearable and burdensome , and very hard to live with ; all your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit , and made useless to the world simply because you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people
his mother , johanna , was generally described as vivacious and sociable
she died 24 years later
some of arthurs negative opinions about women may be rooted in his troubled relationship with his mother
arthur moved to hamburg to live with his friend jean anthime , who was also studying to become a merchant
he moved to weimar but did not live with his mother , who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they would not get along very well
cartwright ( 2010 )
131 their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences
he accused his mother of being financially irresponsible , flirtatious and seeking to remarry , which he considered an insult to his fathers memory
his mother , while professing her love to him , criticized him sharply for being moody , tactless , and argumentative , and urged him to improve his behavior so that he would not alienate people
arthur concentrated on his studies , which were now going very well , and he also enjoyed the usual social life such as balls , parties and theater
by that time johannas famous salon was well established among local intellectuals and dignitaries , the most celebrated of them being goethe
arthur attended her parties , usually when he knew that goethe would be there—although the famous writer and statesman seemed not even to notice the young and unknown student
it is possible that goethe kept a distance because johanna warned him about her sons depressive and combative nature , or because goethe was then on bad terms with arthurs language instructor and roommate , franz passow
schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful karoline jagemann , mistress of karl august , grand duke of saxe - weimar - eisenach , and he wrote to her his only known love poem
despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality , schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs—usually with women of lower social status , such as servants , actresses , and sometimes even paid prostitutes
in a letter to his friend anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out - of - wedlock daughters ( born in 1819 and 1836 ) , both of whom died in infancy
in their youthful correspondence arthur and anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits—but schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually did not find him very charming or physically attractive , and his desires often remained unfulfilled
he left weimar to become a student at the university of göttingen in 1809
there are no written reasons about why schopenhauer chose that university instead of the then more famous university of jena , but göttingen was known as more modern and scientifically oriented , with less attention given to theology
law or medicine were usual choices for young men of schopenhauers status who also needed career and income ; he chose medicine due to his scientific interests
among his notable professors were bernhard friedrich thibaut , arnold hermann ludwig heeren , johann friedrich blumenbach , friedrich stromeyer , heinrich adolf schrader , johann tobias mayer and konrad johann martin langenbeck
he studied metaphysics , psychology and logic under gottlob ernst schulze , the author of aenesidemus , who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on plato and immanuel kant
he decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810–11 and he left göttingen , which did not have a strong philosophy program besides schulze , the only other philosophy professor was friedrich bouterwek , whom schopenhauer disliked
he did not regret his medicinal and scientific studies ; he claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher , and even in berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy
cartwright ( 2010 )
170 during his days at göttingen , he spent considerable time studying , but also continued his flute playing and social life
his friends included friedrich gotthilf osann , karl witte , christian charles josias von bunsen , and william backhouse astor sr
he arrived at the newly founded university of berlin for the winter semester of 1811–12
at the same time , his mother had just begun her literary career ; she published her first book in 1810 , a biography of her friend karl ludwig fernow , which was a critical success
arthur attended lectures by the prominent post - kantian philosopher johann gottlieb fichte , but quickly found many points of disagreement with his ; he also found fichtes lectures tedious and hard to understand
cartwright ( 2010 )
159 he later mentioned fichte only in critical , negative terms—seeing his philosophy as a lower - quality version of kants and considering it useful only because fichtes poor arguments unintentionally highlighted some failings of kantianism
he also attended the lectures of the famous protestant theologian friedrich schleiermacher , whom he also quickly came to dislike
his notes and comments on schleiermachers lectures show that schopenhauer was becoming very critical of religion and moving towards atheism
he learned by self - directed reading ; besides plato , kant and fichte he also read the works of schelling , fries , jacobi , bacon , locke , and much current scientific literature
he attended philological courses by august böckh and friedrich august wolf and continued his naturalistic interests with courses by martin heinrich klaproth , paul erman , johann elert bode , ernst gottfried fischer , johann horkel , friedrich christian rosenthal and hinrich lichtenstein ( lichtenstein was also a friend whom he met at one of his mothers parties in weimar )
schopenhauer left berlin in a rush in 1813 , fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as prussia had just joined the war against france
he returned to weimar but left after less than a month , disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover , georg friedrich konrad ludwig müller von gerstenbergk ( 1778–1838 ) , a civil servant twelve years younger than her ; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his fathers memory
he settled for a while in rudolstadt , hoping that no army would pass through the small town
he spent his time in solitude , hiking in the mountains and the thuringian forest and writing his dissertation , on the fourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason
he completed his dissertation at about the same time as the french army was defeated at the battle of leipzig
he became irritated by the arrival of soldiers in the town and accepted his mothers invitation to visit her in weimar
she tried to convince him that her relationship with gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intention of remarrying
but schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented , pretentious , and nationalistic
his mother had just published her second book , reminiscences of a journey in the years 1803 , 1804 , and 1805 , a description of their family tour of europe , which quickly became a hit
she found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy
in a fit of temper arthur told her that people would read his work long after the rubbish she wrote was totally forgotten
in fact , although they considered her novels of dubious quality , the brockhaus publishing firm held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well
hans brockhaus ( 1888–1965 ) later claimed that his predecessors saw nothing in this manuscript , but wanted to please one of our best - selling authors by publishing her sons work
we published more and more of her son arthurs work and today nobody remembers johanna , but her sons works are in steady demand and contribute to brockhauss reputation
he kept large portraits of the pair in his office in leipzig for the edification of his new editors
also contrary to his mothers prediction , schopenhauers dissertation made an impression on goethe , to whom he sent it as a gift
although it is doubtful that goethe agreed with schopenhauers philosophical positions , he was impressed by his intellect and extensive scientific education
their subsequent meetings and correspondence were a great honor to a young philosopher , who was finally acknowledged by his intellectual hero
they mostly discussed goethes newly published ( and somewhat lukewarmly received ) work on color theory
schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject , on vision and colors , which in many points differed from his teachers
although they remained polite towards each other , their growing theoretical disagreements—and especially schopenhauers extreme self - confidence and tactless criticisms—soon made goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent
schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection , but he continued to praise goethe , and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own
cartwright ( 2010 )
another important experience during his stay in weimar was his acquaintance with friedrich majer—a historian of religion , orientalist and disciple of herder—who introduced him to eastern philosophy and put them on a par with plato and kant
cartwright ( 2010 )
272 he continued his studies by reading the bhagavad gita , an amateurish german journal asiatisches magazin and asiatick researches by the asiatic society
schopenhauer held a profound respect for indian philosophy ; which he came to regard as the best religion
his studies on hindu and buddhist texts were constrained by the lack of adequate literature , and only later realized the similarities with buddhism
schopenhauer read the latin translation and praised the upanishads in his main work , the world as will and representation ( 1819 ) , as well as in his parerga and paralipomena ( 1851 ) , and commented , in the whole world there is no study so beneficial and so elevating as that of the upanishads
it has been the solace of my life , it will be the solace of my death
as the relationship with his mother fell to a new low , in may 1814 he left weimar and moved to dresden
he continued his philosophical studies , enjoyed the cultural life , socialized with intellectuals and engaged in sexual affairs
his friends in dresden were johann gottlob von quandt , friedrich laun , karl christian friedrich krause and ludwig sigismund ruhl , a young painter who made a romanticized portrait of him in which he improved some of schopenhauers unattractive physical features
his criticisms of local artists occasionally caused public quarrels when he ran into them in public
schopenhauers main occupation during his stay in dresden was his seminal philosophical work , the world as will and representation , which he started writing in 1814 and finished in 1818
he was recommended to the publisher friedrich arnold brockhaus by baron ferdinand von biedenfeld , an acquaintance of his mother
although brockhaus accepted his manuscript , schopenhauer made a poor impression because of his quarrelsome and fussy attitude , as well as very poor sales of the book after it was published in december 1818
in september 1818 , while waiting for his book to be published and conveniently escaping an affair with a maid that caused an unwanted pregnancy , schopenhauer left dresden for a year - long vacation in italy
he visited venice , bologna , florence , naples and milan , travelling alone or accompanied by mostly english tourists he met
he spent the winter months in rome , where he accidentally met his acquaintance karl witte and engaged in numerous quarrels with german tourists in the caffè greco , among them johann friedrich böhmer , who also mentioned his insulting remarks and unpleasant character
he enjoyed art , architecture , and ancient ruins , attended plays and operas , and continued his philosophical contemplation and love affairs
one of his affairs supposedly became serious , and for a while he contemplated marriage to a rich italian noblewoman—but , despite his mentioning this several times , no details are known and it may have been schopenhauer exaggerating
he corresponded regularly with his sister adele and became close to her as her relationship with johanna and gerstenbergk also deteriorated
she informed him about their financial troubles as the banking house of muhl in danzig—in which her mother invested their whole savings and arthur a third of his—was near bankruptcy
arthur offered to share his assets , but his mother refused and became further enraged by his insulting comments
cartwright ( 2010 )
352 the women managed to receive only thirty percent of their savings while arthur , using his business knowledge , took a suspicious and aggressive stance towards the banker and eventually received his part in full
the affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of the schopenhauer family
he shortened his stay in italy because of the trouble with muhl and returned to dresden
disturbed by the financial risk and the lack of responses to his book he decided to take an academic position since it provided him with both income and an opportunity to promote his views
he contacted his friends at universities in heidelberg , göttingen and berlin and found berlin most attractive
he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher hegel , whom schopenhauer described as a clumsy charlatan
he was especially appalled by hegels supposedly poor knowledge of natural sciences and tried to engage him in a quarrel about it already at his test lecture in march 1820
hegel was also facing political suspicions at the time , when many progressive professors were fired , while schopenhauer carefully mentioned in his application that he had no interest in politics
despite their differences and the arrogant request to schedule lectures at the same time as his own , hegel still voted to accept schopenhauer to the university
only five students turned up to schopenhauers lectures , and he dropped out of academia
a late essay , on university philosophy , expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies
after his tenure in academia , he continued to travel extensively , visiting leipzig , nuremberg , stuttgart , schaffhausen , vevey , milan and spending eight months in florence
before he left for his three - year travel , schopenhauer had an incident with his berlin neighbor , 47 - year - old seamstress caroline louise marquet
the details of the august 1821 incident are unknown
he claimed that he had just pushed her from his entrance after she had rudely refused to leave , and that she had purposely fallen to the ground so that she could sue him
she claimed that he had attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work
she immediately sued him , and the process lasted until may 1827 , when a court found schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 1842
schopenhauer enjoyed italy , where he studied art and socialized with italian and english nobles
it was his last visit to the country
he left for munich and stayed there for a year , mostly recuperating from various health issues , some of them possibly caused by venereal diseases ( the treatment his doctor used suggests syphilis )
he contacted publishers , offering to translate hume into german and kant into english , but his proposals were declined
returning to berlin , he began to study spanish so he could read some of his favorite authors in their original language
he liked pedro calderón de la barca , lope de vega , miguel de cervantes , and especially baltasar gracián
he also made failed attempts to publish his translations of their works
few attempts to revive his lectures—again scheduled at the same time as hegels—also failed , as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities
during his berlin years , schopenhauer occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have a family
cartwright ( 2010 )
404 for a while he was unsuccessfully courting 17 - year - old flora weiss , who was 22 years younger than himself
his unpublished writings from that time show that he was already very critical of monogamy but still not advocating polygyny—instead musing about a polyamorous relationship that he called tetragamy
he had an on - and - off relationship with a young dancer , caroline richter ( she also used the surname medon after one of her ex - lovers )
they met when he was 33 and she was 19 and working at the berlin opera
she had already had numerous lovers and a son out of wedlock , and later gave birth to another son , this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat ( she soon had another pregnancy but the child was stillborn )
as schopenhauer was preparing to escape from berlin in 1831 , due to a cholera epidemic , he offered to take her with him on the condition that she left her young son behind
she refused and he went alone ; in his will he left her a significant sum of money , but insisted that it should not be spent in any way on her second son
schopenhauer claimed that , in his last year in berlin , he had a prophetic dream that urged him to escape from the city
cartwright ( 2010 )
436 as he arrived in his new home in frankfurt , he supposedly had another supernatural experience , an apparition of his dead father and his mother , who was still alive
this experience led him to spend some time investigating paranormal phenomena and magic
he was quite critical of the available studies and claimed that they were mostly ignorant or fraudulent , but he did believe that there are authentic cases of such phenomena and tried to explain them through his metaphysics as manifestations of the will
upon his arrival in frankfurt , he experienced a period of depression and declining health
he renewed his correspondence with his mother , and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father
by now johanna and adele were living very modestly
johannas writing did not bring her much income , and her popularity was waning
their correspondence remained reserved , and arthur seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838
his relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849
in july 1832 schopenhauer left frankfurt for mannheim but returned in july 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life , except for a few short journeys
he lived alone except for a succession of pet poodles named atman and butz
in 1836 , he published on the will in nature
in 1836 , he sent his essay on the freedom of the will to the contest of the royal norwegian society of sciences and won the prize for the following year
he sent another essay , on the basis of morality , to the royal danish society for scientific studies , but did not win the prize despite being the only contestant
the society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner , and claimed that the essay missed the point of the set topic and that the arguments were inadequate
schopenhauer , who had been very confident that he would win , was enraged by this rejection
he published both essays as the two basic problems of ethics
the first edition , published in 1841 , again failed to draw attention to his philosophy
in the preface to the second edition , in 1860 , he was still pouring insults on the royal danish society
two years later , after some negotiations , he managed to convince his publisher , brockhaus , to print the second , updated edition of the world as will and representation
that book was again mostly ignored and the few reviews were mixed or negative
schopenhauer began to attract some followers , mostly outside academia , among practical professionals ( several of them were lawyers ) who pursued private philosophical studies
he jokingly referred to them as evangelists and apostles
one of the most active early followers was julius frauenstädt , who wrote numerous articles promoting schopenhauers philosophy
he was also instrumental in finding another publisher after brockhaus declined to publish parerga and paralipomena , believing that it would be another failure
cartwright ( 2010 )
506 though schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him , claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas , frauenstädt continued to promote schopenhauers work
they renewed their communication in 1859 and schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate
frauenstädt also became the editor of the first collected works of schopenhauer
in 1848 , schopenhauer witnessed violent upheaval in frankfurt after general hans adolf erdmann von auerswald and prince felix lichnowsky were murdered
he became worried for his own safety and property
cartwright ( 2010 )
514 even earlier in life he had had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves
he gave a friendly welcome to austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels
the rebellion passed without any loss to schopenhauer and he later praised alfred i , prince of windisch - grätz for restoring order
cartwright ( 2010 )
515 he even modified his will , leaving a large part of his property to a prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle
as young hegelians were advocating change and progress , schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans and that , even if some utopian society were established , people would still fight each other out of boredom , or would starve due to overpopulation
in 1851 , schopenhauer published parerga and paralipomena , which contains essays that are supplementary to his main work
it was his first successful , widely read book , partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews
the essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually did not contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system
cartwright ( 2010 )
539 many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but did not take his philosophy seriously
his early critics liked to point out similarities of his ideas to those fichte and schelling , cartwright ( 2010 )
381–386 or to claim that there were numerous contradictions in his philosophy
both criticisms enraged schopenhauer
he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights , but encouraged his disciples to do so
his private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions , inconsistencies , and vagueness in his philosophy , but claimed that he was not concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions and that some of his ideas should not be taken literally but instead as metaphors
academic philosophers were also starting to notice his work
in 1856 , the university of leipzig sponsored an essay contest about schopenhauers philosophy , which was won by rudolf seydels very critical essay
schopenhauers friend jules lunteschütz made the first of his four portraits of him—which schopenhauer did not particularly like—which was soon sold to a wealthy landowner , carl ferdinand wiesike , who built a house to display it
schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this , and would claim that it was his first chapel
as his fame increased , copies of paintings and photographs of him were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he had lived and written his works
people visited frankfurts englischer hof to observe him dining
admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs
he complained that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends had already died from old age
he remained healthy in his own old age , which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather and always getting enough sleep
he had a great appetite and could read without glasses , but his hearing had been declining since his youth and he developed problems with rheumatism
cartwright ( 2010 )
545 he remained active and lucid , continued his reading , writing and correspondence until his death
the numerous notes that he made during these years , amongst others on aging , were published posthumously under the title senilia
in the spring of 1860 his health began to decline , and he experienced shortness of breath and heart palpitations ; in september he suffered inflammation of the lungs and , although he was starting to recover , he remained very weak
the last friend to visit him was wilhelm gwinner ; according to him , schopenhauer was concerned that he would not be able to finish his planned additions to parerga and paralipomena but was at peace with dying
he died of pulmonary - respiratory failure on 21 september 1860 while sitting at home on his couch
he died at the age of 72 and had a funeral conducted by a lutheran minister
schopenhauer saw his philosophy as an extension of kants , and used the results of kantian epistemological investigation ( transcendental idealism ) as starting point for his own
kant had argued that the empirical world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our mental representations
schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work the world is my representation ( die welt ist meine vorstellung )
everything that there is for cognition ( the entire world ) exists simply as an object in relation to a subject—a representation to a subject
everything that belongs to the world is , therefore , subject - dependent
in book one of the world as will and representation , schopenhauer considers the world from this angle—that is , insofar as it is representation
in november 1813 goethe invited schopenhauer to help him on his theory of colours
although schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter , he accepted the invitation out of admiration for goethe
nevertheless , these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality
kant openly admitted that it was humes skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations in his critique of pure reason and gave an elaborate proof to show that causality is a priori
after schulze had made it plausible that kant had not disproven humes skepticism , it was up to those loyal to kants project to prove this important matter
the difference between the approaches of kant and schopenhauer was this kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is given to us from outside , an expression with which schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction
causality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions , as hume had maintained ; instead , as kant had said , objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality
by this intellectual operation , comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause , the external world arises
with vision , finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines
we are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object , that inverts the impressions on the retinas , and that uses the change in the apparent position of an object relative to more distant objects provided by binocular vision to perceive depth and distance
schopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception ; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation
he set out his theory of perception for the first time in on vision and colors , and , in the subsequent editions of fourfold root , an extensive exposition is given in § 21
in book two of the world as will and representation , schopenhauer considers what the world is beyond the aspect of it that appears to us—that is , the aspect of the world beyond representation , the world considered in - itself or noumena , its inner essence
the very being in - itself of all things , schopenhauer argues , is will ( wille )
the empirical world that appears to us as representation has plurality and is ordered in a spatio - temporal framework
the world as thing in - itself must exist outside the subjective forms of space and time
although the world manifests itself to our experience as a multiplicity of objects ( the objectivation of the will ) , each element of this multiplicity has the same blind essence striving towards existence and life
human rationality is merely a secondary phenomenon that does not distinguish humanity from the rest of nature at the fundamental , essential level
the advanced cognitive abilities of human beings , schopenhauer argues , serve the ends of willing—an illogical , directionless , ceaseless striving that condemns the human individual to a life of suffering unredeemed by any final purpose
schopenhauers philosophy of the will as the essential reality behind the world as representation is often called metaphysical voluntarism
for schopenhauer , understanding the world as will leads to ethical concerns ( see the ethics section below for further detail ) , which he explores in the fourth book of the world as will and representation and again in his two prize essays on ethics , on the freedom of the will and on the basis of morality
no individual human actions are free , schopenhauer argues , because they are events in the world of appearance and thus are subject to the principle of sufficient reason a persons actions are a necessary consequence of motives and the given character of the individual human
necessity extends to the actions of human beings just as it does to every other appearance , and thus we cannot speak of freedom of individual willing
albert einstein quoted the schopenhauerian idea that a man can do as he will , but not will as he will
yet the will as thing in - itself is free , as it exists beyond the realm of representation and thus is not constrained by any of the forms of necessity that are part of the principle of sufficient reason
according to schopenhauer , salvation from our miserable existence can come through the wills being tranquillized by the metaphysical insight that reveals individuality to be merely an illusion
the saint or great soul intuitively recognizes the whole , comprehends its essence , and finds that it is constantly passing away , caught up in vain strivings , inner conflict , and perpetual suffering
the negation of the will , in other words , stems from the insight that the world in - itself ( free from the forms of space and time ) is one
ascetic practices , schopenhauer remarks , are used to aid the wills self - abolition , which brings about a blissful , redemptive will - less state of emptiness that is free from striving or suffering
for schopenhauer , human willing—desiring , craving , etcetera—is at the root of suffering
a temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation
here one moves away from ordinary cognizance of individual things to cognizance of eternal platonic ideas—in other words , cognizance that is free from the service of will
in aesthetic contemplation , one no longer perceives an object of perception as something from which one is separated ; rather it is as if the object alone existed without anyone perceiving it , and one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception , but the two have become one , the entirety of consciousness entirely filled and occupied by a single perceptual image
subject and object are no longer distinguishable , and the idea comes to the fore
from this aesthetic immersion , one is no longer an individual who suffers as a result of servitude to ones individual will but , rather , becomes a pure , will - less , painless , timeless , subject of cognition
the pure , will - less subject of cognition is cognizant only of ideas , not individual things this is a kind of cognition that is unconcerned with relations between objects according to the principle of sufficient reason ( time , space , cause and effect ) and instead involves complete absorption in the object
art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation , since it attempts to depict the essence / pure ideas of the world
music , for schopenhauer , is the purest form of art because it is the one that depicts the will itself without it appearing as subject to the principle of sufficient reason , therefore as an individual object
according to daniel albright , schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas , but actually embodied the will itself
he deemed music a timeless , universal language comprehended everywhere , that can imbue global enthusiasm , if in possession of a significant melody
schopenhauers realist views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of contemporaneous attempts to prove the parallel postulate in euclidean geometry
writing shortly before the discovery of hyperbolic geometry demonstrated the logical independence of the axiom—and long before the general theory of relativity revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space—schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect concepts to prove what he held was directly evident from intuitive perception
throughout his writings , schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts , instead of from intuitive perceptions
although schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove euclids parallel postulate , he did see a reason for examining another of euclids axioms
schopenhauer asserts that the task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done , but to investigate moral actions
as such , he states that philosophy is always theoretical its task to explain what is given
according to kants transcendental idealism , space and time are forms of our sensibility in which phenomena appear in multiplicity
reality in itself is free from multiplicity , not in the sense that an object is one , but that it is outside the possibility of multiplicity
two individuals , though they appear distinct , are in - themselves not distinct
appearances are entirely subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason
the egoistic individual who focuses his aims on his own interests has to deal with empirical laws as well as he can
what is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self - interest
if we take a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support their needs instead of his own pleasures , then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes less distinction between himself and others than is usually made
regarding how things appear to us , the egoist asserts a gap between two individuals , but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own
in the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals , though they appear as distinct from himself
what motivates the altruist is compassion
the suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent , but he feels connectiveness to all beings
compassion is thus the basis of morality
schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the principium individuationis
when we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence
individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others—the will , as the only thing that exists , has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure
this is a fundamental characteristic of the will , and cannot be circumvented
unlike temporal or human justice , which requires time to repay an evil deed and has its seat in the state , as requiting and punishing , eternal justice rules not the state but the world , is not dependent upon human institutions , is not subject to chance and deception , is not uncertain , wavering , and erring , but infallible , fixed , and sure
the world as will and idea vol
1 § 63 eternal justice is not retributive , because retribution requires time
there are no delays or reprieves
instead , punishment is tied to the offence , to the point where the two become one
tormenter and tormented are one
the tormenter errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering ; the tormented , in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt
he who sees through the principium individuationis and comprehends suffering in general as his own will see suffering everywhere and , instead of fighting for the happiness of his individual manifestation , will abhor life itself since he knows that it is inseparably connected with suffering
for him , a happy individual life in a world of suffering is like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king
those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge cannot affirm life , but exhibit asceticism and quietism , meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives , are not concerned about their individual welfare , and accept without resistance the evil that others inflict on them
they welcome poverty and neither seek nor flee death
schopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live
human life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction and , instead of continuing their struggle , ascetics break it
it does not matter if these ascetics adhere to the dogmata of christianity or to dharmic religions , since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge
philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the necessity of sex , but schopenhauer addressed sex and related concepts forthrightly
he named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason the will to live or will to life ( wille zum leben ) , defined as an inherent drive within human beings , and all creatures , to stay alive ; a force that inveigles us into reproducing
schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental , but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within mans psyche , guaranteeing the quality of the human race
it has often been argued that schopenhauers thoughts on sexuality foreshadowed the theory of evolution , a claim met with satisfaction by darwin as he included a quotation from schopenhauer in his descent of man
this has also been noted about freuds concepts of the libido and the unconscious mind , and evolutionary psychology in general
schopenhauers politics were an echo of his system of ethics , which he elucidated in detail in his die beiden grundprobleme der ethik ( the two essays on the freedom of the will and on the basis of morality )
in occasional political comments in his parerga and paralipomena and manuscript remains , schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of limited government
schopenhauer shared the view of thomas hobbes on the necessity of the state and state action to check the innate destructive tendencies of our species
he also defended the independence of the legislative , judicial and executive branches of power , and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice ( in a practical and everyday sense , not a cosmological one )
he declared that monarchy is natural to man in almost the same way as it is to bees and ants , to cranes in flight , to wandering elephants , to wolves in a pack in search of prey , and to other animals

intellect in monarchies , he writes , always has much better chances against stupidity , its implacable and ever - present foe , than it has in republics ; but this is a great advantage
on the other hand , schopenhauer disparaged republicanism as being as unnatural to man as it is unfavorable to higher intellectual life and thus to the arts and sciences
by his own admission , schopenhauer did not give much thought to politics , and several times he wrote proudly of how little attention he paid to political affairs of his day
in a life that spanned several revolutions in french and german government , and a few continent - shaking wars , he maintained his position of minding not the times but the eternities
he wrote many disparaging remarks about germany and the germans
a typical example is for a german it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth , for he thinks slowly , and they give him time to reflect
the state , schopenhauer claimed , punishes criminals to prevent future crimes
it places beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone , in the inescapable punishment
accordingly , the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter - motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imaginedschopenhauer , the world as will and representation , vol
i , § 62
he claimed that this doctrine was not original to him but had appeared in the writings of plato , seneca , hobbes , pufendorf , and anselm feuerbach
schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern white races due to their sensitivity and creativity ( except for the ancient egyptians and hindus , whom he saw as equal )
the highest civilization and culture , apart from the ancient hindus and egyptians , are found exclusively among the white races ; and even with many dark peoples , the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has , therefore , evidently immigrated , for example , the brahmans , the incas , and the rulers of the south sea islands
all this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north , and there gradually became white , had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need , want and misery , which in their many forms were brought about by the climate
this they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization
schopenhauer was fervently opposed to slavery
speaking of the treatment of slaves in the slave - holding states of the united states , he condemned those devils in human form , those bigoted , church - going , strict sabbath - observing scoundrels , especially the anglican parsons among them for how they treat their innocent black brothers who through violence and injustice have fallen into their devils claws
the slave - holding states of north america , schopenhauer writes , are a disgrace to the whole of humanity
further , the consideration as to the complexion is very decided
blondes prefer dark persons , or brunettes ; but the latter seldom prefer the former
the reason is , that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type , almost an abnormity , analogous to white mice , or at least to grey horses
in no part of the world , not even in the vicinity of the pole , are they indigenous , except in europe , and are clearly of scandinavian origin
i may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man , but that by nature he has a black or brown skin , like our forefathers the hindus ; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature , and that thus there is no such thing as a white race , much as this is talked of , but every white man is a faded or bleached one
forced into the strange world , where he only exists like an exotic plant , and like this requires in winter the hothouse , in the course of thousands of years man became white
the gipsies , an indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago , show the transition from the complexion of the hindu to our own
therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type ; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature , though not so that the brown of the hindu repels us
finally , each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations , and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is
schopenhauer also maintained a marked metaphysical and political anti - judaism
he argued that christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of judaism , exhibiting an indian - influenced ethics reflecting the aryan - vedic theme of spiritual self - conquest
he saw this as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly jewish spirit
judaism is , therefore , the crudest and poorest of all religions and consists merely in an absurd and revolting theism
it amounts to this that the κύριος lord , who has created the world , desires to be worshipped and adored ; and so above all he is jealous , is envious of his colleagues , of all the other gods ; if sacrifices are made to them he is furious and his jews have a bad time it is most deplorable that this religion has become the basis of the prevailing religion of europe ; for it is a religion without any metaphysical tendency
while all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life , the religion of the jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war - cry in the struggle with other nations
in his 1851 essay on women , schopenhauer expressed opposition to what he called teutonico - christian stupidity of reflexive , unexamined reverence for the female ( abgeschmackten weiberveneration )
he wrote women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish , frivolous and short - sighted
he opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice , and expressed his opposition to monogamy
he claimed that woman is by nature meant to obey
the essay does give some compliments women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than men are , and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others
schopenhauers writings influenced many , from friedrich nietzsche to nineteenth - century feminists
feminism and the limits of equality
pa cain – ga
, 1989 his biological analysis of the difference between the sexes , and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction , anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists
when the elderly schopenhauer sat for a sculpture portrait by the prussian sculptor elisabet ney in 1859 , he was much impressed by the young womans wit and independence , as well as by her skill as a visual artist
after his time with ney , he told richard wagners friend malwida von meysenbug i have not yet spoken my last word about women
i believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass , or rather raising herself above the mass , she grows ceaselessly and more than a man
in the third , expanded edition of the world as will and representation ( 1859 ) , schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the metaphysics of sexual love
he wrote that pederasty has the benefit of preventing ill - begotten children
concerning this , he stated that the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature , and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims , although only indirectly , as a means for preventing greater evils
schopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that by expounding these paradoxical ideas , i wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour
i have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that i defend and commend pederasty
schopenhauer viewed personality and intellect as inherited
he quotes horaces saying , from the brave and good are the brave descended ( odes , iv , 4 , 29 ) and shakespeares line from cymbeline , cowards father cowards , and base things sire base ( iv , 2 ) to reinforce his hereditarian argument
mechanistically , schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his intellect through his mother , and personal character through the father
this belief in heritability of traits informed schopenhauers view of love—placing it at the highest level of importance
for schopenhauer the final aim of all love intrigues , be they comic or tragic , is really of more importance than all other ends in human life
what it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation
it is not the weal or woe of any one individual , but that of the human race to come , which is here at stake
this view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on eugenics or good breeding
here schopenhauer wrote
with our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties , we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within , not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation
plato had something of the kind in mind when , in the fifth book of his republic , he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste
if we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent , and give men of noble character a whole harem , and procure men , and indeed thorough men , for all girls of intellect and understanding , then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of pericles
in another context , schopenhauer reiterated his eugenic thesis if you want utopian plans , i would say the only solution to the problem is the despotism of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy , a genuine nobility , achieved by mating the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women
this proposal constitutes my utopia and my platonic republic
analysts ( for example , keith ansell - pearson ) have suggested that schopenhauers anti - egalitarianist sentiment and his support for eugenics influenced the neo - aristocratic philosophy of friedrich nietzsche , who initially considered schopenhauer his mentor
as a consequence of his monistic philosophy , schopenhauer was very concerned about animal welfare
for him , all individual animals , including humans , are essentially phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying will
for him the word will designates force , power , impulse , energy , and desire ; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the essence of all external things and our own direct , inner experience
since every living thing possesses will , humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other
for this reason , he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals , who are our fellow sufferers
in 1841 , he praised the establishment in london of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals , and in philadelphia of the animals friends society
schopenhauer went so far as to protest using the pronoun it in reference to animals because that led to treatment of them as though they were inanimate things
to reinforce his points , schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter
schopenhauer was very attached to his succession of pet poodles
he criticized spinozas belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans
schopenhauer read the latin translation of the ancient hindu texts , the upanishads , translated by french writer anquetil du perron and regarded the upanishads as the most profitable and elevating reading which is possible in the world
it has been the solace of my life , and will be the solace of my death
schopenhauer was first introduced to anquetil du perrons translation by friedrich majer in 1814
they met during the winter of 1813–1814 in weimar at the home of schopenhauers mother , according to the biographer safranski
majer was a follower of herder , and an early indologist
schopenhauer did not begin serious study of the indic texts until the summer of 1814
safranski maintains that , between 1815 and 1817 , schopenhauer had another important cross - pollination with indian thought in dresden
this was through his neighbor of two years , karl christian friedrich krause
krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with ancient indian wisdom
krause had also mastered sanskrit , unlike schopenhauer , and they developed a professional relationship
it was from krause that schopenhauer learned meditation and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning indian thought
the book oupnekhat ( upanishad ) always lay open on his table , and he invariably studied it before going to bed
he called the opening up of sanskrit literature the greatest gift of our century , and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the upanishads would become the cherished faith of the west
most noticeable , in the case of schopenhauers work , was the significance of the chandogya upanishad , whose mahāvākya , tat tvam asi , is mentioned throughout the world as will and representation
schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the four noble truths of buddhism

similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering , that suffering is caused by desire ( taṇhā ) , and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation
thus three of the four truths of the buddha correspond to schopenhauers doctrine of the will
in buddhism , while greed and lust are always unskillful , desire is ethically variable – it can be skillful , unskillful , or neutral
david burton , buddhism , knowledge and liberation a philosophical study

for schopenhauer , will had ontological primacy over the intellect ; desire is prior to thought
schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of puruṣārtha or goals of life in vedānta hinduism
buddhist nirvāṇa is not equivalent to the condition that schopenhauer described as denial of the will
nirvāṇa is not the extinguishing of the person as some western scholars have thought , but only the extinguishing ( the literal meaning of nirvana ) of the flames of greed , hatred , and delusion that assail a persons character
schopenhauer made the following statement in his discussion of religions
schopenhauer is often said to be the first modern western philosopher to attempt integration of his work with eastern ways of thinking
that he was the first is true , but the claim that he was influenced by indian thought needs qualification
there is a remarkable correspondence in broad terms between some central schopenhauerian doctrines and buddhism notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering , that suffering originates in desires , and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires
these three truths of the buddha are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will
( on this , see dorothea dauer , schopenhauer as transmitter of buddhist ideas

if i wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth , i should have to concede to buddhism pre - eminence over the others
in any case , it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own , for this numbers far more followers than any other
and this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me , inasmuch as in my philosophizing i have certainly not been under its influence emphasis added
for up till 1818 , when my work appeared , there was to be found in europe only a very few accounts of buddhism
buddhist philosopher keiji nishitani sought to distance buddhism from schopenhauer
while schopenhauers philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary , his methodology was resolutely empirical , rather than speculative or transcendental
philosophy is a science , and as such has no articles of faith ; accordingly , in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically , or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions
this actual world of what is knowable , in which we are and which is in us , remains both the material and the limit of our consideration
the argument that buddhism affected schopenhauers philosophy more than any other dharmic faith loses credence since he did not begin a serious study of buddhism until after the publication of the world as will and representation in 1818
scholars have started to revise earlier views about schopenhauers discovery of buddhism
proof of early interest and influence appears in schopenhauers 1815–16 notes ( transcribed and translated by urs app ) about buddhism
they are included in a recent case study that traces schopenhauers interest in buddhism and documents its influence

; schopenhauers early notes on buddhism reproduced in appendix )
this study provides an overview of the actual discovery of buddhism by schopenhauer
other scholarly work questions how similar schopenhauers philosophy actually is to buddhism
some traditions in western esotericism and parapsychology interested schopenhauer and influenced his philosophical theories
he praised animal magnetism as evidence for the reality of magic in his on the will in nature , and went so far as to accept the division of magic into left - hand and right - hand magic , although he doubted the existence of demons
schopenhauer grounded magic in the will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human will , not on ritual
this theory notably parallels aleister crowleys system of magick and its emphasis on human will
given the importance of the will to schopenhauers overarching system , this amounts to suggesting his whole philosophical system had magical powers
schopenhauer rejected the theory of disenchantment and claimed philosophy should synthesize itself with magic , which he believed amount to practical metaphysics
neoplatonism , including the traditions of plotinus and to a lesser extent marsilio ficino , has also been cited as an influence on schopenhauer
in his student years , schopenhauer went more often to lectures in the sciences than philosophy
he kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death , and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library
many evenings were spent in the theatre , opera and ballet ; schopenhauer especially liked the operas of mozart , rossini and bellini
as a polyglot , he knew german , italian , spanish , french , english , latin and ancient greek , and was an avid reader of poetry and literature
he particularly revered goethe , petrarch , calderón and shakespeare
if goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with kant in order to counterbalance him , so to speak , in the spirit of the age , the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction
but now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the german spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity
in philosophy , his most important influences were , according to himself , kant , plato and the upanishads
concerning the upanishads and vedas , he writes in the world as will and representation
if the reader has also received the benefit of the vedas , the access to which by means of the upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century ( 1818 ) may claim before all previous centuries , if then the reader , i say , has received his initiation in primeval indian wisdom , and received it with an open heart , he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what i have to tell him
it will not sound to him strange , as to many others , much less disagreeable ; for i might , if it did not sound conceited , contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the upanishads , may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which i have to enunciate , though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there
schopenhauer saw bruno and spinoza as philosophers not bound to their age or nation
both were fulfilled by the thought , that as manifold the appearances of the world may be , it is still one being , that appears in all of them
consequently , there is no place for god as creator of the world in their philosophy , but god is the world itself
schopenhauer expressed regret that spinoza stuck for the presentation of his philosophy with the concepts of scholasticism and cartesian philosophy , and tried to use geometrical proofs that do not hold because of vague and overly broad definitions
bruno on the other hand , who knew much about nature and ancient literature , presented his ideas with italian vividness , and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near platos poetic and dramatic power of exposition
schopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics , and it is therefore very remarkable that spinoza called his main work ethics
in fact , it could be considered complete from the standpoint of life - affirmation , if one completely ignores morality and self - denial
as the key to tractatus de intellectus emendatione
the importance of kant for schopenhauer , in philosophy as well as on a personal level , cannot be overstated
kants philosophy was the foundation of schopenhauers , and he had high praise for the transcendental aesthetic section of kants critique of pure reason
schopenhauer maintained that kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as berkeley and plato , as copernicus to hicetas , philolaus , and aristarchus kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted
schopenhauer writes about kants influence on his work in the preface to the second edition of the world as will and representation
in his study room , one bust was of buddha , the other was of kant
the bond which schopenhauer felt with the philosopher of königsberg is demonstrated in an unfinished poem he dedicated to kant ( included in volume 2 of the parerga )
schopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work , the world as will and representation , to a detailed criticism of the kantian philosophy
schopenhauer praised kant for his distinction between appearance and the thing - in - itself , whereas the general consensus in german idealism was that this was the weakest spot of kants theory ,
the leading figures of post - kantian philosophy—johann gottlieb fichte , schelling and hegel—were not respected by schopenhauer
he argued that they were not philosophers at all , for they lacked the first requirement of a philosopher , namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry
rather , they were merely sophists who , excelling in the art of beguiling the public , pursued their own selfish interests ( such as professional advancement within the university system )
diatribes against the vacuity , dishonesty , pomposity , and self - interest of these contemporaries are to be found throughout schopenhauers published writings
the following passage is an example
schopenhauer deemed schelling the most talented of the three and wrote that he would recommend his elucidatory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of kant concerning the intelligible character , if he had been honest enough to admit he was parroting kant , instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner
schopenhauer reserved his most unqualified damning condemnation for hegel , whom he considered less worthy than fichte or schelling
whereas fichte was merely a windbag ( windbeutel ) , hegel was a commonplace , inane , loathsome , repulsive , and ignorant charlatan
the philosophers karl popper and mario bunge agreed with this distinction
hegel , schopenhauer wrote in the preface to his two fundamental problems of ethics , not only performed no service to philosophy , but he has had a detrimental influence on philosophy , and thereby on german literature in general , really a downright stupefying , or we could even say a pestilential influence , which it is therefore the duty of everyone capable of thinking for himself and judging for himself to counteract in the most express terms at every opportunity
schopenhauer remained the most influential german philosopher until the first world war
his philosophy was a starting point for a new generation of philosophers including julius bahnsen , paul deussen , lazar von hellenbach , karl robert eduard von hartmann , ernst otto lindner , philipp mainländer , friedrich nietzsche , olga plümacher and agnes taubert
his legacy shaped the intellectual debate , and forced movements that were utterly opposed to him , neo - kantianism and positivism , to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored , and in doing so he changed them markedly
the french writer maupassant commented that to - day even those who execrate him seem to carry in their own souls particles of his thought
other philosophers of the 19th century who cited his influence include hans vaihinger , volkelt , solovyov and weininger
schopenhauer was well read by physicists , most notably einstein , schrödinger , wolfgang pauli , in his berlin study three figures hung on the wall faraday , maxwell , schopenhauer
when erwin schrödinger discovered schopenhauer ( the greatest savant of the west ) he considered switching his study of physics to philosophy
but most of all schopenhauer is famous for his influence on artists
richard wagner became one of the earliest and most famous adherents of the schopenhauerian philosophy
the admiration was not mutual , and schopenhauer proclaimed i remain faithful to rossini and mozart so he has been nicknamed the artists philosopher
see also influence of schopenhauer on tristan und isolde
under the influence of schopenhauer , leo tolstoy became convinced that the truth of all religions lies in self - renunciation
when he read schopenhauers philosophy , tolstoy exclaimed at present i am convinced that schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men
it is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection
he said that what he has written in war and peace is also said by schopenhauer in the world as will and representation
jorge luis borges remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view , despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular , was because schopenhauer had already written it for him
other figures in literature who were strongly influenced by schopenhauer were thomas mann , thomas hardy , afanasy fet , - huysmans and george santayana
schopenhauers attraction to and discussions of both eastern and western religions in conjunction with each other made an impression on melville in his final years
sergei prokofiev , although initially reluctant to engage with works noted for their pessimism , became fascinated with schopenhauer after reading aphorisms on the wisdom of life in parerga and paralipomena
with his truths schopenhauer gave me a spiritual world and an awareness of happiness
friedrich nietzsche owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading the world as will and representation and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected , dedicating to him his essay schopenhauer als erzieher one of his untimely meditations
early in his career , ludwig wittgenstein adopted schopenhauers epistemological idealism , and some traits of schopenhauers influence ( particularly schopenhauerian transcendentalism ) can be observed in the tractatus logico - philosophicus
later on , wittgenstein rejected epistemological transcendental idealism for gottlob freges conceptual realism
in later years , wittgenstein became highly dismissive of schopenhauer , describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker
his friend bertrand russell had a low opinion on the philosopher , and even came to attack him in his history of western philosophy for hypocritically praising asceticism yet not acting upon it
opposite to russell on the foundations of mathematics , the dutch mathematician brouwer incorporated kants and schopenhauers ideas in the philosophical school of intuitionism , where mathematics is considered as a purely mental activity instead of an analytic activity wherein objective properties of reality are revealed
brouwer was also influenced by schopenhauers metaphysics , and wrote an essay on mysticism
schopenhauers philosophy has made its way into a novel , the schopenhauer cure , by american existential psychiatrist and emeritus professor of psychiatry irvin yalom
schopenhauers philosophy , and the discussions on philosophical pessimism it has engendered , has been the focus of contemporary thinkers such as david benatar , thomas ligotti , and eugene thacker
their work also served as an inspiration for the popular hbo tv series true detective
angola , officially the republic of angola , is a country on the west coast of southern africa
it is the second - largest lusophone ( portuguese - speaking ) country in both total area and population ( behind brazil in both cases ) , and is the seventh - largest country in africa
it is bordered by namibia to the south , the dr congo to the north , zambia to the east , and the atlantic ocean to the west
angola has an exclave province , the province of cabinda , that borders the republic of the congo and the democratic republic of the congo
the capital and most populated city is luanda
angola has been inhabited since the paleolithic age
its formation as a nation - state originates from portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century
in the 19th century , european settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior
the portuguese colony that became angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century , owing to resistance by native groups such as the cuamato , the kwanyama and the mbunda
after a protracted anti - colonial struggle , angola achieved independence in 1975 as a marxist–leninist one - party republic
the country descended into a devastating civil war the same year , between the ruling peoples movement for the liberation of angola ( mpla ) , backed by the soviet union and cuba , the insurgent anti - communist national union for the total independence of angola ( unita ) , supported by the united states and south africa , and the militant organisation national liberation front of angola ( fnla ) , backed by the democratic republic of the congo
the country has been governed by mpla ever since its independence in 1975
following the end of the war in 2002 , angola emerged as a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic
angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest - growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , economic growth is highly uneven , with most of the nations wealth concentrated in a disproportionately small sector of the population and highly concentrated in china and in the united states
since 2017 , the government of joão lourenço has made fighting corruption its flagship , so much so that many individuals of the previous government are either jailed or awaiting trial
whilst this effort has been recognised by foreign diplomats to be legitimate ,
angola is a member of the united nations , opec , african union , the community of portuguese language countries , and the southern african development community
as of 2021 , the angolan population is estimated at 32 million
angola is multicultural and multiethnic
angolan culture reflects centuries of portuguese influence , namely the predominance of the portuguese language and of the catholic church , intermingled with a variety of indigenous customs and traditions
the name angola comes from the portuguese colonial name the toponym was derived by the portuguese from the title
modern angola was populated predominantly by nomadic khoi and san prior to the first bantu migrations
the khoi and san peoples were neither pastoralists nor cultivators , but rather hunter - gatherers
bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of bananas and taro , as well as large cattle herds , to angolas central highlands and the luanda plain
a number of political entities were established ; the best - known of these was the kingdom of the kongo , based in angola , which extended northward to what is now the democratic republic of the congo , the republic of the congo and gabon
it established trade routes with other city - states and civilisations up to and down the coast of southwestern and western africa and even with great zimbabwe and the mutapa empire , although it engaged in little or no transoceanic trade
portuguese explorer diogo cão reached the area in 1484
the previous year , the portuguese had established relations with the kongo , which stretched at the time from modern gabon in the north to the kwanza river in the south
the portuguese established their primary early trading post at soyo , which is now the northernmost city in angola apart from the cabinda exclave
paulo dias de novais founded são paulo de loanda ( luanda ) in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers
benguela was fortified in 1587 and became a township in 1617
the portuguese established several other settlements , forts and trading posts along the angolan coast , principally trading in angolan slaves for plantations
local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the portuguese empire ,
despite portugals territorial claims in angola , its control over much of the countrys vast interior was minimal

jahrhundert , colónia / alemanha köppe , 1996
during the portuguese restoration war , the dutch west india company occupied the principal settlement of luanda in 1641 , using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against portuguese holdings elsewhere
a fleet under salvador de sá retook luanda in 1648 ; reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650
new treaties with the kongo were signed in 1649 ; others with njingas kingdom of matamba and ndongo followed in 1656
the conquest of pungo andongo in 1671 was the last major portuguese expansion from luanda , as attempts to invade kongo in 1670 and matamba in 1681 failed
colonial outposts also expanded inward from benguela , but until the late 19th century the inroads from luanda and benguela were very limited
hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s , portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of angolan territory
the slave trade was abolished in angola in 1836 , and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves
four years later , a more progressive administration appointed by portugal abolished slavery altogether
however , these decrees remained largely unenforceable , and the portuguese depended on assistance from the british royal navy to enforce their ban on the slave trade
this coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions into the bush
by the mid - nineteenth century portugal had established its dominion as far north as the congo river and as far south as mossâmedes
until the late 1880s , portugal entertained proposals to link angola with its colony in mozambique but was blocked by british and belgian opposition
in this period , the portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in angola
the berlin conference in 1884–1885 set the colonys borders , delineating the boundaries of portuguese claims in angola , although many details were unresolved until the 1920s
trade between portugal and its african territories rapidly increased as a result of protective tariffs , leading to increased development , and a wave of new portuguese immigrants
under colonial law , black angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions
during the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from ad hoc labour activism in the rural workforce
portugals refusal to address increasing angolan demands for self - determination provoked an armed conflict , which erupted in 1961 with the baixa de cassanje revolt and gradually evolved into a protracted war of independence that persisted for the next twelve years

the national front for the liberation of angola ( fnla ) recruited from bakongo refugees in zaire
people on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical kingdom of kongo
though as foreigners skilled angolans could not take advantage of mobutu sese sekos state employment programme , some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures
the migrants eventually formed the fnla with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to angola
a largely ovimbundu guerrilla initiative against the portuguese in central angola from 1966 was spearheaded by jonas savimbi and the national union for the total independence of angola ( unita )
it remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders , the ethnic fragmentation of the ovimbundu , and the isolation of peasants on european plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise
during the late 1950s , the rise of the marxist–leninist popular movement for the liberation of angola ( mpla ) in the east and dembos hills north of luanda came to hold special significance
formed as a coalition resistance movement by the angolan communist party , the organisations leadership remained predominantly ambundu and courted public sector workers in luanda
although both the mpla and its rivals accepted material assistance from the soviet union or the peoples republic of china , the former harboured strong anti - imperialist views and was openly critical of the united states and its support for portugal
this allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front , soliciting support from nonaligned governments in morocco , ghana , guinea , mali , and the united arab republic
the mpla attempted to move its headquarters from conakry to léopoldville in october 1961 , renewing efforts to create a common front with the fnla , then known as the union of angolan peoples ( upa ) and its leader holden roberto
roberto turned down the offer
when the mpla first attempted to insert its own insurgents into angola , the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by upa partisans on robertos orders—setting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the angolan civil war
throughout the war of independence , the three rival nationalist movements were severely hampered by political and military factionalism , as well as their inability to unite guerrilla efforts against the portuguese
the collapse of portugals estado novo government following the 1974 carnation revolution suspended all portuguese military activity in africa and the brokering of a ceasefire pending negotiations for angolan independence
encouraged by the organisation of african unity , holden roberto , jonas savimbi , and mpla chairman agostinho neto met in mombasa in early january 1975 and agreed to form a coalition government

in august 1975 , the mpla requested direct assistance from the soviet union in the form of ground troops
the soviets declined , offering to send advisers but no troops ; however , cuba was more forthcoming and in late september dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to angola , along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies
by independence , there were over a thousand cuban soldiers in the country
they were kept supplied by a massive airbridge carried out with soviet aircraft
the persistent buildup of cuban and soviet military aid allowed the mpla to drive its opponents from luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by zairean and south african troops , which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the fnla and unita
the fnla was largely annihilated , although unita managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces
from there , savimbi continued to mount a determined insurgent campaign against the mpla
between 1975 and 1991 , the mpla implemented an economic and political system based on the principles of scientific socialism , incorporating central planning and a marxist–leninist one - party state
the ruling party survived an attempted coup détat by the maoist - oriented communist organisation of angola ( oca ) in 1977 , which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges left thousands of oca supporters dead
the mpla abandoned its former marxist ideology at its third party congress in 1990 , and declared social democracy to be its new platform
angola subsequently became a member of the international monetary fund ; restrictions on the market economy were also reduced in an attempt to draw foreign investment
on 22 march 2002 , jonas savimbi was killed in action against government troops
unita and the mpla reached a cease - fire shortly afterwards
unita gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of a major opposition party
although the political situation of the country began to stabilise , regular democratic processes did not prevail until the elections in angola in 2008 and 2012 and the adoption of a new constitution in 2010 , all of which strengthened the prevailing dominant - party system
angola has a serious humanitarian crisis ; the result of the prolonged war , of the abundance of minefields , and the continued political agitation in favour of the independence of the exclave of cabinda ( carried out in the context of the protracted cabinda conflict by the flec )
while most of the internally displaced have now squatted around the capital , in musseques ( shanty towns ) the general situation for angolans remains desperate
a drought in 2016 caused the worst food crisis in southern africa in 25 years , affecting 1 million people across seven of angolas 18 provinces
food prices rose and acute malnutrition rates doubled , with more than 95 , 000 children affected
josé eduardo dos santos stepped down as president of angola after 38 years in 2017 , being peacefully succeeded by joão lourenço , santos chosen successor
at angola is the worlds twenty - fourth largest country - comparable in size to mali , or twice the size of france or of texas
it lies mostly between latitudes 4° and 18°s , and longitudes 12° and 24°e
angola borders namibia to the south , zambia to the east , the democratic republic of the congo to the north - east and the south atlantic ocean to the west
the coastal exclave of cabinda in the north has borders with the republic of the congo to the north and with the democratic republic of the congo to the south
angola had a 2018 forest landscape integrity index mean score of 8 / 10 , ranking it 23rd globally out of 172 countries
angola , although located in a tropical zone , has a climate uncharacteristic of this zone , due to the confluence of three factors
while the coastline has high rainfall rates , decreasing from north to south and from , with average annual temperatures above , one can divide the interior zone into three areas
with an area of approximately wide , of the democratic republic of congo along the lower congo river
cabinda borders the congo republic to the north and north - northeast and the drc to the east and south
the town of cabinda is the chief population centre
according to a 1995 census , cabinda had an estimated population of 600 , 000 , approximately 400 , 000 of whom are citizens of neighboring countries
population estimates are , however , highly unreliable
consisting largely of tropical forest , cabinda produces hardwoods , coffee , cocoa , crude rubber and palm oil
the product for which it is best known , however , is its oil , which has given it the nickname , the kuwait of africa
cabindas petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of angolas output
most of the oil along its coast was discovered under portuguese rule by the cabinda gulf oil company ( cabgoc ) from 1968 onwards
ever since portugal handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of angola to the local independence groups ( mpla , unita and fnla ) , the territory of cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the government of angola ( which has employed its armed forces , the faa—forças armadas angolanas ) and cabindan separatists
the front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda - armed forces of cabinda ( flec - fac ) announced the virtual federal republic of cabinda under the presidency of nzita henriques tiago
one of the characteristics of the cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation , into smaller and smaller factions
the angolan government is composed of three branches of government executive , legislative and judicial
the executive branch of the government is composed of the president , the vice - presidents and the council of ministers
the legislative branch comprises a 220 - seat unicameral legislature , the national assembly of angola , elected from both provincial and nationwide constituencies
for decades , political power has been concentrated in the presidency
in what has been described as a political purge to cement his power and reduce the influence of the dos santos family , lourenço subsequently sacked the chief of the national police , ambrósio de lemos , and the head of the intelligence service , apolinário josé pereira
both are considered allies of former president dos santos
the constitution of 2010 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens
the legal system is based on portuguese law and customary law but is weak and fragmented , and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities
a supreme court serves as the appellate tribunal ; a constitutional court does not hold the powers of judicial review
governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by the president
after the end of the civil war , the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international community to become more democratic and less authoritarian
its reaction was to implement a number of changes without substantially changing its character
the new constitution , adopted in 2010 , did away with presidential elections , introducing a system in which the president and the vice - president of the political party that wins the parliamentary elections automatically become president and vice - president
directly or indirectly , the president controls all other organs of the state , so there is de facto no separation of powers
in the classifications used in constitutional law , this government falls under the category of authoritarian regime
the angolan armed forces ( faa , forças armadas angolanas ) are headed by a chief of staff who reports to the minister of defence
there are three divisions—the army ( exército ) , navy ( marinha de guerra , mga ) and national air force ( força aérea nacional , fan )
total manpower is 107 , 000 ; plus paramilitary forces of 10 , 000 ( 2015 est
its equipment includes russian - manufactured fighters , bombers and transport planes
there are also brazilian - made emb - 312 tucanos for training , czech - made l - 39s for training and bombing , and a variety of western - made aircraft such as the c - 212aviocar , sud aviation alouette iii , etcetera a small number of faa personnel are stationed in the democratic republic of the congo ( kinshasa )
the national police departments are public order , criminal investigation , traffic and transport , investigation and inspection of economic activities , taxation and frontier supervision , riot police and the rapid intervention police
the national police are in the process of standing up an air wing ,
the national police have implemented a modernisation and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force
in addition to administrative reorganisation , modernisation projects include procurement of new vehicles , aircraft and equipment , construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories , restructured training programmes and the replacement of akm rifles with 9mm uzis for officers in urban areas
a supreme court serves as a court of appeal
the constitutional court is the supreme body of the constitutional jurisdiction , established with the approval of law no
2 / 08 , of 17 june – organic law of the constitutional court and law n
3 / 08 , of 17 june – organic law of the constitutional process
the legal system is based on portuguese and customary law
there are 12 courts in more than 140 counties in the country
its first task was the validation of the candidacies of the political parties to the legislative elections of 5 september 2008
thus , on 25 june 2008 , the constitutional court was institutionalized and its judicial counselors assumed the position before the president of the republic
currently , seven advisory judges are present , four men and three women
in 2014 , a new penal code took effect in angola
the classification of money - laundering as a crime is one of the novelties in the new legislation
angola is a founding member state of the community of portuguese language countries ( cplp ) , also known as the lusophone commonwealth , an international organization and political association of lusophone nations across four continents , where portuguese is an official language
on 16 october 2014 , angola was elected for the second time a non - permanent member of the united nations security council , with 190 favorable votes out of a total of 193
the term of office began on 1 january 2015 and expired on 31 december 2016
since january 2014 , the republic of angola has been chairing the international conference for the great lakes region ( cirgl )
80 in 2015 , cirgl executive secretary ntumba luaba said that angola is the example to be followed by the members of the organization , due to the significant progress made during the 12 years of peace , namely in terms of socio - economic stability and political - military
angola is classified as not free by freedom house in the freedom in the world 2014 report
the report noted that the august 2012 parliamentary elections , in which the ruling popular movement for the liberation of angola won more than 70 of the vote , suffered from serious flaws , including outdated and inaccurate voter rolls
voter turnout dropped from 80 in 2008 to 60
a 2012 report by the department of state said , the three most important human rights abuses in 2012 were official corruption and impunity ; limits on the freedoms of assembly , association , speech , and press ; and cruel and excessive punishment , including reported cases of torture and beatings as well as unlawful killings by police and other security personnel
angola ranked forty - two of forty - eight sub - saharan african states on the 2007 index of african governance list and scored poorly on the 2013 ibrahim index of african governance
in 2019 , homosexual acts were decriminalized in angola , and the government also prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation
the vote was overwhelming 155 for , 1 against , 7 abstaining
angola has diamonds , oil , gold , copper and rich wildlife ( which was dramatically depleted during the civil war ) , forest and fossil fuels
since independence , oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource
smallholder and plantation agriculture dramatically dropped in the angolan civil war , but began to recover after 2002
angolas economy has in recent years moved on from the disarray caused by a quarter - century of angolan civil war to become the fastest - growing economy in africa and one of the fastest - growing in the world , with an average gdp growth of 20 between 2005 and 2007
in the period 2001–10 , angola had the worlds highest annual average gdp growth , at 11
in 2004 , the exim bank of china approved a 2billion line of credit to angola , to be used for rebuilding angolas infrastructure , and to limit the influence of the international monetary fund there
china is angolas biggest trade partner and export destination as well as the fourth - largest source of imports
bilateral trade reached 27billion in 2011 , up 11 year - on - year
chinas imports , mainly crude oil and diamonds , increased 9 to 24billion while chinas exports to angola , including mechanical and electrical products , machinery parts and construction materials , surged 38
the angolan economy grew 18 in 2005 , 26 in 2006 and 17 in 2007
due to the global recession , the economy contracted an estimated −0 in 2009
the security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has allowed the resettlement of 4million displaced persons and a resulting large - scale increase in agriculture production
angolas economy is expected to grow by 3 per cent in 2014 said the international monetary fund ( imf ) , robust growth in the non - oil economy , mainly driven by a very good performance in the agricultural sector , is expected to offset a temporary drop in oil production
angolas financial system is maintained by the national bank of angola and managed by the governor jose de lima massano
according to a study on the banking sector , carried out by deloitte , the monetary policy led by banco nacional de angola ( bna ) , the angolan national bank , allowed a decrease in the inflation rate put at 7 in december 2013 , which contributed to the sectors growth trend
although the countrys economy has grown significantly since angola achieved political stability in 2002 , mainly due to fast - rising earnings in the oil sector , angola faces huge social and economic problems these are in part a result of almost continual armed conflict from 1961 on , although the highest level of destruction and socio - economic damage took place after the 1975 independence , during the long years of civil war
however , high poverty rates and blatant social inequality chiefly stems from persistent authoritarianism , neo - patrimonial practices at all levels of the political , administrative , military and economic structures , and of a pervasive corruption
the main beneficiaries are political , administrative , economic and military power holders , who have accumulated ( and continue to accumulate ) enormous wealth
secondary beneficiaries are the middle strata that are about to become social classes
however , almost half the population has to be considered poor , with dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities , where slightly more than 50 of the people reside
a study carried out in 2008 by the angolan instituto nacional de estatística found that in rural areas roughly 58 must be classified as poor according to un norms but in the urban areas only 19 , and an overall rate of 37
in cities , a majority of families , well beyond those officially classified as poor , must adopt a variety of survival strategies
in january 2020 , a leak of government documents known as the luanda leaks showed that consulting companies such as boston consulting group , mckinsey company , and pricewaterhousecoopers had helped members of the family of former president josé eduardo dos santos ( especially his daughter isabel dos santos ) corruptly run sonangol for their own personal profit , helping them use the companys revenues to fund vanity projects in france and switzerland
the enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem for the angolan economy , illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in luanda and neighbouring bengo province , while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression
one of the economic consequences of social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in angolan private investments abroad
the small fringe of angolan society where most of the asset accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets , for reasons of security and profit
for the time being , the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in portugal where the angolan presence ( including the family of the state president ) in banks as well as in the domains of energy , telecommunications , and mass media has become notable , as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of tourism enterprises
angola has upgraded critical infrastructure , an investment made possible by funds from the nations development of oil resources
however , at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country for so long has not diminished , but has deepened in all respects
with a stock of assets corresponding to 70billion kz ( us6billion ) , angola is now the third - largest financial market in sub - saharan africa , surpassed only by nigeria and south africa
according to the angolan minister of economy , abraão gourgel , the financial market of the country grew modestly since 2002 and now occupies third place in sub - saharan africa
on 19 december 2014 , the capital market in angola was launched
bodiva ( angola stock exchange and derivatives , in english ) was allocated the secondary public debt market , and was expected to launch the corporate debt market by 2015 , though the stock market itself was only expected to commence trading in 2016
the economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 of angolas economy , almost all of the countrys revenue and all of its dominant exports
according to the heritage foundation , a conservative american think tank , oil production from angola has increased so significantly that angola now is chinas biggest supplier of oil
growing oil revenues also created opportunities for corruption according to a recent human rights watch report , 32billion us dollars disappeared from government accounts in 2007–2010
in 2002 , angola demanded compensation for oil spills allegedly caused by chevron corporation , the first time it had fined a multinational corporation operating in its waters
operations in its diamond mines include partnerships between state - run endiama and mining companies such as alrosa which operate in angola
access to biocapacity in angola is higher than world average
in 2016 , angola had 1 global hectares in 2016 , angola used 1 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their ecological footprint of consumption
this means they use about half as much biocapacity as angola contains
as a result , angola is running a biocapacity reserve
agriculture and forestry is an area of potential opportunity for the country
the african economic outlook organization states that angola requires 4 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55 of the maize it needs , 20 of the rice and just 5 of its required wheat
angola 2014 retrieved from http / / www

in addition , the world bank estimates that less than 3 per cent of angolas abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited
before independence in 1975 , angola was a bread - basket of southern africa and a major exporter of bananas , coffee and sisal , but three decades of civil war ( 1975–2002 ) destroyed fertile countryside , left it littered with landmines and drove millions into the cities
the country now depends on expensive food imports , mainly from south africa and portugal , while more than 90 of farming is done at the family and subsistence level
thousands of angolan small - scale farmers are trapped in poverty
on 11 march 2015 , the first angolan forum of telecommunications and information technology was held in luanda under the motto the challenges of telecommunications in the current context of angola , a study of this sector , presented at the forum , said angola had the first telecommunications operator in africa to test lte – with speeds up to 400 mbit / s – and mobile penetration of about 75 ; there are about 3 million smartphones in the angolan market ; there are about
the first angolan satellite , angosat - 1 , was launched into orbit on 26 december 2017
due to an on - board power failure during solar panel deployment , on 27 december , rsc energia revealed that they lost communications contact with the satellite
although , subsequent attempts to restore communications with the satellite were successful , the satellite eventually stopped sending data and rsc energia confirmed that angosat - 1 was inoperable
the launch of angosat - 1 was aimed at ensuring telecommunications throughout the country
a replacement satellite named angosat - 2 is in the works and was expected to be in service by 2020

angola has a population of 24 , 383 , 301 inhabitants according to the preliminary results of its 2014 census , the first one conducted or carried out since 15 december 1970
it is composed of ovimbundu ( language umbundu ) 37 , ambundu ( language kimbundu ) 23 , bakongo 13 , and 32 other ethnic groups ( including the chokwe , the ovambo , the ganguela and the xindonga ) as well as about 2 mulattos ( mixed european and african ) , 1 chinese and 1 european
the ambundu and ovimbundu ethnic groups combined form a majority of the population , at 62
the population is forecast to grow to over 60 million people in 2050 , 2 times the 2014 population
however , on 23 march 2016 , official data revealed by angolas national statistic institute – instituto nacional de estatística ( ine ) , states that angola has a population of 25 , 789 , 024 inhabitants
it is estimated that angola was host to 12 , 100 refugees and 2 , 900 asylum seekers by the end of 2007
11 , 400 of those refugees were originally from the democratic republic of congo , who arrived in the 1970s
nb this figure is highly doubtful , as it makes no clear distinction between migrant workers , refugees and immigrants
at least 220 , 000 portuguese , 1 million angolans are mixed race ( black and white )
since 2003 , more than 400 , 000 congolese migrants have been expelled from angola
the chinese population stands at 258 , 920 , mostly composed of temporary migrants
the languages in angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups and portuguese , introduced during the portuguese colonial era
the most widely spoken indigenous languages are umbundu , kimbundu and kikongo , in that order
portuguese is the official language of the country
although the exact numbers of those fluent in portuguese or who speak portuguese as a first language are unknown , a 2012 study mentions that portuguese is the first language of 39 of the population
according to the 2014 census , portuguese is spoken by 71 of angolans , umbundu by 23 , kikongo by 8 , kimbundu by 7 , chokwe by 6 , nyaneka by 3 , ngangela by 3 , fiote by 2 , kwanyama by 2 , muhumbi by 2 , luvale by 1 , and other languages by 4
there are about 1 , 000 religious communities , mostly christian , in angola
while reliable statistics are nonexistent , estimates have it that more than half of the population are catholics , while about a quarter adhere to the protestant churches introduced during the colonial period the congregationalists mainly among the ovimbundu of the central highlands and the coastal region to its west , the methodists concentrating on the kimbundu speaking strip from luanda to malanje , the baptists almost exclusively among the bakongo of the north - west ( now present in luanda as well ) and dispersed adventists , reformed and lutherans
in luanda and region there subsists a nucleus of the syncretic tocoists and in the north - west a sprinkling of kimbanguism can be found , spreading from the congo / zaïre
since independence , hundreds of pentecostal and similar communities have sprung up in the cities , whereby now about 50 of the population is living ; several of these communities / churches are of brazilian origin
in a study assessing nations levels of religious regulation and persecution with scores ranging from 0 to 10 where 0 represented low levels of regulation or persecution , angola was scored 0 on government regulation of religion , 4 on social regulation of religion , 0 on government favoritism of religion and 0 on religious persecution
foreign missionaries were very active prior to independence in 1975 , although since the beginning of the anti - colonial fight in 1961 the portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro - independence sentiments
missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s , although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations
the catholic church and some major protestant denominations mostly keep to themselves in contrast to the new churches which actively proselytize
catholics , as well as some major protestant denominations , provide help for the poor in the form of crop seeds , farm animals , medical care and education
epidemics of cholera , malaria , rabies and african hemorrhagic fevers like marburg hemorrhagic fever , are common diseases in several parts of the country
many regions in this country have high incidence rates of tuberculosis and high hiv prevalence rates
dengue , filariasis , leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region
angola has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world and one of the worlds lowest life expectancies
a 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in angola

this cancer institute will be assumed as a reference institution in the central and southern regions of africa
in 2014 , angola launched a national campaign of vaccination against measles , extended to every child under ten years old and aiming to go to all 18 provinces in the country
a yellow fever outbreak , the worst in the country in three decades began in december 2015

pupils are often responsible for paying additional school - related expenses , including fees for books and supplies
in 1999 , the gross primary enrollment rate was 74 per cent and in 1998 , the most recent year for which data are available , the net primary enrollment rate was 61 per cent
gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of pupils formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance
there continue to be significant disparities in enrollment between rural and urban areas
in 1995 , 71 per cent of children ages 7 to 14 years were attending school
it is reported that higher percentages of boys attend school than girls
during the angolan civil war ( 1975–2002 ) , nearly half of all schools were reportedly looted and destroyed , leading to current problems with overcrowding
the ministry of education recruited 20 , 000 new teachers in 2005 and continued to implement teacher training
teachers tend to be underpaid , inadequately trained and overworked ( sometimes teaching two or three shifts a day )
some teachers may reportedly demand payment or bribes directly from their pupils
other factors , such as the presence of landmines , lack of resources and identity papers , and poor health prevent children from regularly attending school
although budgetary allocations for education were increased in 2004 , the education system in angola continues to be extremely under - funded
according to estimates by the unesco institute for statistics , the adult literacy rate in 2011 was 70
82 of men and 54 of women are literate as of 2001
since independence from portugal in 1975 , a number of angolan students continued to be admitted every year at high schools , polytechnical institutes and universities in portugal and brazil through bilateral agreements ; in general , these students belong to the elites
in september 2014 , the angolan ministry of education announced an investment of 16 million euros in the computerisation of over 300 classrooms across the country
the project also includes training teachers at a national level , as a way to introduce and use new information technologies in primary schools , thus reflecting an improvement in the quality of teaching
in 2010 , the angolan government started building the angolan media libraries network , distributed throughout several provinces in the country to facilitate the peoples access to information and knowledge
each site has a bibliographic archive , multimedia resources and computers with internet access , as well as areas for reading , researching and socialising
at this time , the mobile media libraries are already operating in the provinces of luanda , malanje , uíge , cabinda and lunda south
as for rema , the provinces of luanda , benguela , lubango and soyo have currently working media libraries
angolan culture has been heavily influenced by portuguese culture , especially in language and religion , and the culture of the indigenous ethnic groups of angola , predominantly bantu culture
the diverse ethnic communities—the ovimbundu , ambundu , bakongo , chokwe , mbunda and other peoples—to varying degrees maintain their own cultural traits , traditions and languages , but in the cities , where slightly more than half of the population now lives , a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times ; in luanda , since its foundation in the 16th century
in this urban culture , portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant
african roots are evident in music and dance and is moulding the way in which portuguese is spoken
this process is well reflected in contemporary angolan literature , especially in the works of angolan authors
in 2014 , angola resumed the national festival of angolan culture after a 25 - year break

this article is about the demographic features of the population of angola , including population density , ethnicity , education level , health of the populace , economic status , religious affiliations and other aspects of the population
ethnically , there are three main groups , each speaking a bantu language the ovimbundu who represent 37 of the population , the ambundu with 25 , and the bakongo 13
other numerically important groups include the closely interrelated chokwe and lunda , the ganguela and nyaneka - khumbi ( in both cases classification terms that stand for a variety of small groups ) , the ovambo , the herero , the xindonga and scattered residual groups of san
in addition , mixed race ( european and african ) people amount to about 2 , with a small ( 1 ) population of whites , mainly ethnically portuguese
as a former overseas territory of portugal until 1975 , angola possesses a portuguese population of over 200 , 000 , a number that has been growing from 2000 onwards , because of angolas growing demand for qualified human resources
currently , over 300 , 000 angolans are white , 1 million angolans are mixed race ( black and white ) and 50 , 000 angolans are from china , which accounts for 1 million people
in 1974 , white angolans made up a population of 330 , 000 to 350 , 000 people in an overall population of 6 million angolans at that time
the only reliable source on these numbers is gerald bender stanley yoder , whites in angola on the eve of independence the politics of numbers , africa today , 21 ( 4 ) 1974 , pp
today , many angolans who are not ethnic portuguese can claim portuguese nationality under portuguese law
estimates on the overall population are given in http / / www
net / pt / opais / det7192 o país in 1974 / 75 , over 25 , 000 cuban soldiers arrived in angola to help the mpla forces at the beginning of the angolan civil war
once this was over , a massive development cooperation in the field of health and education brought in numerous civil personnel from cuba
however , only a very small percentage of all these people has remained in angola , either for personal reasons ( intermarriage ) or as professionals ( for example , medical doctors )
the largest religious denomination is catholicism , to which adheres about half the population
roughly 26 are followers of traditional forms of protestantism ( congregationals , methodists , baptista , lutherans , reformed ) , but over the last decades there has in addition been a growth of pentecostal communities and african initiated churches
in 2006 , one out of 221 people were jehovahs witnesses
blacks from mali , nigeria and senegal are mostly sunnite muslims , but do not make up more than 1 - 2 of the population
by now few angolans retain african traditional religions following different ethnic faiths
according to the 2022 revision of the world factbook the total population was 34 , 795 , 287 in 2022
the proportion of children below the age of 14 in 2020 was 47 , 49 was between 15 and 65 years of age , while 2 was 65 years or older
registration of vital events is in angola not complete
the population department of the united nations and the cia world factbook prepared the following estimates
the population is growing by 3 annually
there are 44 births and 9 deaths per 1 , 000 citizens
the net migration rate is 0 migrants per 1 , 000 citizens
the fertility rate of angola is 6 children born per woman as of 2017
the infant mortality rate is 67 deaths for every 1 , 000 live births with 73 deaths for males and 61 deaths for females for every 1 , 000 live births
life expectancy at birth is 60 years ; 58 years for males and 62 years for females
according to the cia world factbook , 2 of adults ( aged 15–49 ) are living with hiv / aids ( as of 2009 )
the risk of contracting disease is very high
there are food and waterborne diseases , bacterial and protozoal diarrhea , hepatitis a , and typhoid fever ; vectorborne diseases , malaria , african trypanosomiasis ( sleeping sickness ) ; respiratory disease meningococcal meningitis , and schistosomiasis , a water contact disease , as of 2005
roughly 37 of angolans are ovimbundu , 25 are ambundu , 13 are bakongo , 2 are mestiço , 1 - 2 are white africans , and people from other african ethnicities make up 22 of angolas population
angola is a majority christian country
official statistics do not exist , however it is estimated that over 80 belong to a christian church or community
more than half are catholic , the remaining ones comprising members of traditional protestant churches as well as of pentecostal communities
only 0 are muslims - generally immigrants from other african countries
traditional indigenous religions are practiced by a very small minority , generally in peripheral rural societies
literacy is quite low , with 71 of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in portuguese
82 of males and 60 of women are literate as of 2015
portuguese is the official language of angola , but bantu and other african languages are also widely spoken
in fact , kikongo , kimbundu , umbundu , tuchokwe , nganguela , and ukanyama have the official status of national languages
the mastery of portuguese is widespread ; in the cities the overwhelming majority are either fluent in portuguese or have at least a reasonable working knowledge of this language ; an increasing minority are native portuguese speakers and have a poor , if any , knowledge of an african language
since the adoption of a new constitution in 2010 , the politics of angola takes place in a framework of a presidential republic , whereby the president of angola is both head of state and head of government , and of a multi - party system
executive power is exercised by the government
legislative power is vested in the president , the government and parliament
angola changed from a one - party marxist - leninist system ruled by the popular movement for the liberation of angola ( mpla ) , in place since independence in 1975 , to a multiparty democracy based on a new constitution adopted in 1992
that same year the first parliamentary and presidential elections were held
the mpla won an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections
in the presidential elections , president josé eduardo dos santos won the first round election with more than 49 of the vote to jonas savimbis 40
a runoff election would have been necessary , but never took place
the renewal of civil war immediately after the elections , which were considered as fraudulent by unita , and the collapse of the lusaka protocol , created a split situation
to a certain degree the new democratic institutions worked , notably the national assembly , with the active participation of unitas and the fnlas elected mps - while josé eduardo dos santos continued to exercise his functions without democratic legitimation
however the armed forces of the mpla ( now the official armed forces of the angolan state ) and of unita fought each other until the leader of unita , jonas savimbi , was killed in action in 2002
from 2002 to 2010 , the system as defined by the constitution of 1992 functioned in a relatively normal way
the executive branch of the government was composed of the president , the prime minister and council of ministers
the council of ministers , composed of all ministers and vice ministers , met regularly to discuss policy issues
governors of the 18 provinces were appointed by and served at the pleasure of the president
the 26 - year - long civil war has ravaged the countrys political and social institutions
the un estimates of 1 million internally displaced persons ( idps ) , while generally the accepted figure for war - affected people is 4 million
daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically luanda ( population approximately 6 million ) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions
the ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions
hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment , schools are without books , and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day - to - day work
the 2010 constitution grants the president almost absolute power
elections for the national assembly are to take place every five years , and the president is automatically the leader of the winning party or coalition
it is for the president to appoint ( and dismiss ) all of the following
the president is also provided a variety of powers , like defining the policy of the country
even though its not up to him / her to make laws ( only to promulgate them and make edicts ) , the president is the leader of the winning party
the only relevant post that is not directly appointed by the president is the vice - president , which is the second in the winning party
josé eduardo dos santos stepped down as president of angola after 38 years in 2017 , being peacefully succeeded by joão lourenço , santos chosen successor
the national assembly ( assembleia nacional ) has 223 members , elected for a four - year term , 130 members by proportional representation , 90 members in provincial districts , and 3 members to represent angolans abroad
the general elections in 1997 were rescheduled for 5 september 2008
the ruling party mpla won 82 ( 191 seats in the national assembly ) and the main opposition party won only 10 ( 16 seats )
the elections however have been described as only partly free but certainly not fair
supreme court ( or tribunal da relacao ) judges of the supreme court are appointed by the president
the constitutional court , with the power of judicial review , contains 11 justices
four are appointed by the president , four by the national assembly , two by the superior council of the judiciary , and one elected by the public
angola has eighteen provinces bengo , benguela , bie , cabinda , cuando cubango , cuanza norte , cuanza sul , cunene , huambo , huila , luanda , lunda norte , lunda sul , malanje , moxico , namibe , uige , zaire

the economy of angola remains heavily influenced by the effects of four decades of conflict in the last part of the 20th century , the war for independence from portugal ( 1961–75 ) and the subsequent civil war ( 1975–2002 )
despite extensive oil and gas resources , diamonds , hydroelectric potential , and rich agricultural land , angola remains poor , and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture
since 2002 , when the 27 - year civil war ended , government policy prioritized the repair and improvement of infrastructure and strengthening of political and social institutions
during the first decade of the 21st century , angolas economy was one of the fastest - growing in the world , birgitte refslund sørensen and marc vincent
caught between borders response strategies of the internally displaced , 2001
with reported annual average gdp growth of 11 percent from 2001 to 2010
corruption is rife throughout the economy with the end of the oil boom , from 2015 angola entered into a period of economic contraction
the angolan economy has been dominated by the production of raw materials and the use of cheap labor since european rule began in the sixteenth century
the portuguese used angola principally as a source for the thriving slave trade across the atlantic ; luanda became the greatest slaving port in africa
after the portuguese empire abolished the slave trade in angola in 1858 , it began using concessional agreements , granting exclusive rights to a private company to exploit land , people , and all other resources within a given territory
in mozambique , this policy spawned a number of companies notorious for their exploitation of local labor
but in angola , only diamang showed even moderate success
at the same time , portuguese began emigrating to angola to establish farms and plantations ( fazendas ) to grow cash crops for export
although these farms were only partially successful before world war ii , they formed the basis for the later economic growth
the principal exports of the post - slave economy in the 19th century were rubber , beeswax , and ivory
grains , sugar , and rum were also produced for local consumption
legislation against foreign traders was implemented in the 1890s
the territorys prosperity , however , continued to depend on plantations worked by labor indentured from the interior
before world war ii , the portuguese government was concerned primarily with keeping its colonies self - sufficient and therefore invested little capital in angolas local economy
it built no roads until the mid - 1920s , and the first railroad , the benguela railway , was not completed until 1929
between 1900 and 1940 , only 35 , 000 portuguese emigrants settled in angola , and most worked in commerce in the cities , facilitating trade with portugal
in the rural areas , portuguese settlers often found it difficult to make a living because of fluctuating world prices for sugarcane and sisal and the difficulties in obtaining cheap labor to farm their crops
as a result , they often suspended their operations until the market prices rose and instead marketed the produce of angolan farmers
but in the wake of world war ii , the rapid growth of industrialization worldwide and the parallel requirements for raw materials led portugal to develop closer ties with its colonies and to begin actively developing the angolan economy
in the 1930s , portugal started to develop closer trade ties with its colonies , and by 1940 it absorbed 63 percent of angolan exports and accounted for 47 percent of angolan imports , up from 39 percent and 37 percent , respectively , a decade earlier
when the price of angolas principal crops—coffee and sisal—jumped after the war , the portuguese government began to reinvest some profits inside the country , initiating a series of projects to develop infrastructure
during the 1950s , portugal built dams , hydroelectric power stations , and transportation systems in addition , portuguese citizens were encouraged to emigrate to angola , where planned settlements ( colonatos ) were established for them in the rural areas
finally , the portuguese initiated mining operations for iron ore , manganese , and copper to complement industrial activities at home , and in 1955 the first successful oil wells were drilled in angola
by 1960 the angolan economy had been completely transformed , boasting a successful commercial agricultural sector , a promising mineral and petroleum production enterprise , and an incipient manufacturing industry
yet by 1976 , these encouraging developments had been reversed
the economy was in complete disarray in the aftermath of the war of independence and the subsequent internal fighting of the liberation movements
according to the ruling mpla - pt , in august 1976 more than 80 percent of the agricultural plantations had been abandoned by their portuguese owners ; only 284 out of 692 factories continued to operate ; more than 30 , 000 medium - level and high - level managers , technicians , and skilled workers had left the country ; and 2 , 500 enterprises had been closed ( 75 percent of which had been abandoned by their owners )
furthermore , only 8 , 000 vehicles remained out of 153 , 000 registered , dozens of bridges had been destroyed , the trading network was disrupted , administrative services did not exist , and files and studies were missing
angolas economic ills can also be traced to the legacy of portuguese colonial development
many of the white settlers had come to angola after 1950 and were understandably quick to repatriate during the war of independence
during their stay , however , these settlers had appropriated angolan lands , disrupting local peasant production of cash and subsistence crops
moreover , angolas industries depended on trade with portugal—the colonys overwhelmingly dominant trade partner—for both markets and machinery
only the petroleum and diamond industries boasted a wider clientele for investment and markets
most important , the portuguese had not trained angolans to operate the larger industrial or agricultural enterprises , nor had they actively educated the population
upon independence angola thus found itself without markets or expertise to maintain even minimal economic growth
as a result , the government intervened , nationalizing most businesses and farms abandoned by the portuguese
it established state farms to continue producing coffee , sugar , and sisal , and it took over the operations of all factories to maintain production
these attempts usually failed , primarily because of the lack of experienced managers and the continuing disruptions in rural areas caused by the unita insurgency
only the petroleum sector continued to operate successfully , and by 1980 this sector had helped the gross domestic product reach us3 billion , its highest level up to 1988
in the face of serious economic problems and the continuing war throughout the countryside , in 1987 the government announced plans to liberalize economic policies and promote private investment and involvement in the economy
united nations angola verification mission iii and monua spent us1billion overseeing implementation of the lusaka protocol , a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war
the protocol prohibited unita from buying foreign arms , a provision the united nations largely did not enforce , so both sides continued to build up their stockpile
unita purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in albania and bulgaria , and from zaire , south africa , republic of the congo , zambia , togo , and burkina faso
in october 1997 the un imposed travel sanctions on unita leaders , but the un waited until july 1998 to limit unitas exportation of diamonds and freeze unita bank accounts
while the government gave us250million to unita between 1986 and 1991 , unita made us1billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds , primarily through zaire to europe
at the same time the angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of belarus , brazil , bulgaria , china , and south africa
while no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol , no country informed the register on conventional weapons as required

the civil war internally displaced 3million people , 32 of the population , by 2001

angola produced over and production was expected to grow to by 2020 , angola had a national debt of 76 billion , of which 20 billion is to china
the construction industry is taking advantage of the growing economy , with various housing projects stimulated by the government initiatives for example the angola investe program and the casa feliz or meña projects
not all public construction projects are functional
a case in point kilamba kiaxi , where a whole new satellite town of luanda , consisting of housing facilities for several hundreds of thousands of people , was completely uninhabited for over four years because of skyrocketing prices , but completely sold out after the government decreased the original price and created mortgage plans at around the election time thus made it affordable for middle - class people

reported total manpower in 2021 was about 107 , 000
the faa is headed by the chief of the general staff antónio egídio de sousa santos since 2018 , who reports to the minister of national defense , currently joão ernesto dos santos
the faa succeeded to the previous peoples armed forces for the liberation of angola ( fapla ) following the abortive bicesse accord with the armed forces of the liberation of angola ( fala ) , armed wing of the national union for the total independence of angola ( unita )
as part of the peace agreement , troops from both armies were to be demilitarized and then integrated
integration was never completed as unita and fala went back to war in 1992
later , consequences for fala personnel in luanda were harsh with fapla veterans persecuting their erstwhile opponents in certain areas and reports of vigilantism
the angolan armed forces were created on 9 october 1991
the institutionalization of the faa was made in the bicesse accords , signed in 1991 , between the angolan government and unita
the principles that would govern the faa were defined in a joint proposal presented on september 24 , 1991 and approved on 9 october
on 14 november 1991 , generals joão baptista de matos and abílio kamalata numa were appointed to the superior command of the armed forces

it is organized in two naval zones ( north and south ) , with naval bases in luanda , lobito and moçâmedes
it includes a marines brigade and a marines school , based in ambriz
the navy numbers about 1 , 000 personnel and operates only a handful of small patrol craft and barges
the navy has been neglected and ignored as a military arm mainly due to the guerrilla struggle against the portuguese and the nature of the civil war
from the early 1990s to the present the angolan navy has shrunk from around 4 , 200 personnel to around 1 , 000 , resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment
in order to protect angolas 1 600km long coastline , the angolan navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways
portugal has been providing training through its technical military cooperation ( ctm ) programme
the navy is requesting procurement of a frigate , three corvettes , three offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats
most of the vessels in the navys inventory dates back from the 1980s or earlier , and many of its ships are inoperable due to age and lack of maintenance
however the navy acquired new boats from spain and france in the 1990s
germany has delivered several fast attack craft for border protection in 2011
in september 2014 it was reported that the angolan navy would acquire seven macaé - class patrol vessels from brazil as part of a technical memorandum of understanding ( mou ) covering the production of the vessels as part of angolas naval power development programme ( pronaval )
the military of angola aims to modernize its naval capability , presumably due to a rise in maritime piracy within the gulf of guinea which may have an adverse effect on the countrys economy
the faa include several types of special forces , namely the commandos , the special operations and the marines
the angolan special forces follow the general model of the analogous portuguese special forces , receiving a similar training
the commandos and the special forces are part of the special forces brigade ( brife , brigada de forças especiais ) , based at cabo ledo , in the bengo province
the brife includes two battalions of commandos , a battalion of special operations and sub - units of combat support and service support
the brife also included the special actions group ( gae , grupo de ações especiais ) , which is presently inactive and that was dedicated to long range reconnaissance , covert and sabotage operations
in the cabo ledo base is also installed the special forces training school ( effe , escola de formação de forças especiais )
both the brife and the effe are directly under the directorate of special forces of the general staff of the armed forces
the marines ( fuzileiros navais ) constitute the marines brigade of the angolan navy
the marines brigade is not permanently dependent of the directorate of special forces , but can detach their units and elements to be put under the command of that body for the conduction of exercises or real operations
since the disbandment of the angolan parachute battalion in 2004 , the faa do not have a specialized paratrooper unit
however , elements of the commandos , special operations and marines are parachute qualified
the directorate of peoples defense and territorial troops of the defence ministry or odp was established in late 1975
it had 600 , 000 members , having personnel in virtually every village by 1979
it had both armed and unarmed units dispersed in villages throughout the country
it provides specialized medical assistance in accordance with the military health system ; it also promotes post - graduate education and scientific research
currently , the main military hospital serves 39 special medical specialties
it is a headed by a director general whose main supporting body is the board of directors
the supreme military court is the highest organ of the hierarchy of military courts
the presiding judge , the deputy presiding judge and the other counselor judges of the supreme military court are appointed by the president of the republic
the composition , organization , powers and functioning of the supreme military court are established by law
the faa maintains portuguese - style military bands in all three branches and in individual units
the primary band is the 100 - member music band of the presidential security household
and four years later , on 15 august 1998 , the national air force created a music band within an artistic brigade
the faplas main counterinsurgency effort was directed against unita in the southeast , and its conventional capabilities were demonstrated principally in the undeclared south african border war
library of congress country studies the fapla first performed its external assistance mission with the dispatch of 1 , 000 to 1 , 500 troops to são tomé and príncipe in 1977 to bolster the socialist regime of president manuel pinto da costa
during the next several years , angolan forces conducted joint exercises with their counterparts and exchanged technical operational visits
the angolan expeditionary force was reduced to about 500 in early 1985
the angolan armed forces were controversially involved in training the armed forces of fellow lusophone states cape verde and guinea - bissau
in the case of the latter , the 2012 guinea - bissau coup détat was cited by the coup leaders as due to angolas involvement in trying to reform the military in connivance with the civilian leadership
a small number of faa personnel are stationed in the democratic republic of the congo ( kinshasa ) angola is basically interested in the participation of the faa operations of the african union and has formed special units for this purpose

angola sent a team of 20 officers to participate
the foreign relations of angola are based on angolas strong support of foreign policy as the angolan economy is dependent on foreign aid
from 1975 to 1989 , angola was aligned with the eastern bloc , in particular the soviet union , libya , and cuba
since then , it has focused on improving relationships with western countries , cultivating links with other portuguese - speaking countries , and asserting its own national interests in central africa through military and diplomatic intervention
in 1993 , it established formal diplomatic relations with the united states
it has entered the southern african development community as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely anglophone neighbors to the south
zimbabwe and namibia joined angola in its military intervention in the democratic republic of the congo , where angolan troops remain in support of the joseph kabila government
it also has intervened in the republic of the congo ( brazzaville ) to support the existing government in that country
since 1998 , angola has successfully worked with the united nations security council to impose and carry out sanctions on unita
more recently , it has extended those efforts to controls on conflict diamonds , the primary source of revenue for unita during the civil war that ended in 2002
at the same time , angola has promoted the revival of the community of portuguese - speaking countries ( cplp ) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with portugal ( its former ruler ) and brazil ( which shares many cultural affinities with angola ) in particular
angola is a member of the port management association of eastern and southern africa ( pmaesa )

many thousands of angolans fled the country after the civil war
more than 20 , 000 people were forced to leave the democratic republic of the congo in 2009 , an action the dr congo said was in retaliation for regular expulsion of congolese diamond miners who were in angola illegally
angola sent a delegation to dr congos capital kinshasa and succeeded in stopping government - forced expulsions which had become a tit - for - tat immigration dispute
congo and angola have agreed to suspend expulsions from both sides of the border , said lambert mende , dr congo information minister , in october 2009
following a request by the government of guinea - bissau , angola sent there a contingent of about 300 troops meant to help putting an end to the political - military unrest in that country , and to reorganize the local military forces
in fact , these troops were perceived as a kind of pretorian guard for the ruling party , paigc
in the beginning of april 2012 , when a new military coup détat was under preparation , the angolan regime decided to withdraw its military mission from guinea - bissau

angolan - nigerian relations are primarily based on their roles as oil exporting nations
both are members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries , the african union and other multilateral organizations
angola - south africa relations are quite strong as the ruling parties in both nations , the african national congress in south africa and the mpla in angola , fought together during the angolan civil war and south african border war

nelson mandela mediated between the mpla and unita factions during the last years of angolas civil war
angola - zimbabwe relations have remained cordial since the birth of both states , angola in 1975 and zimbabwe in 1979 , during the cold war
while angolas foreign policy shifted to a pro - stance based on substantial economic ties , under the rule of president robert mugabe zimbabwes ties with the west soured in the late 1990s
commercial and economic ties dominate the relations of each country
parts of both countries were part of the portuguese empire from the early 16th century until brazils independence in 1822
as of november 2007 , trade between the two countries is booming as never before
canada - angola relations were established in 1978 , and canada is accredited to angola from its embassy in harare , zimbabwe
ties have grown since the end of the civil war in 2002 , with increased engagement in areas of mutual interest
as chair of the united nations security councils angola sanctions committee , canada limited the ability of unita to continue its military campaign , sanctions helped to bring a ceasefire agreement to end angolas conflict
during angolas civil war cuban forces fought to install a marxist–leninist mpla - pt government , against western - backed unita and flna guerrillas and the south - african army

relations between the two countries have not always been cordial due to the former french governments policy of supporting militant separatists in angolas cabinda province and the international angolagate scandal embarrassed both governments by exposing corruption and illicit arms deals
following french president nicolas sarkozys visit in 2008 , relations have improved
angola - portugal relations have significantly improved since the angolan government abandoned communism and nominally embraced democracy in 1991 , embracing a pro - and to a lesser degree pro - europe foreign policy
portugal ruled angola for 400 years , colonizing the territory from 1483 until independence in 1975

albert sidney johnston ( february 2 , 1803 – april 6 , 1862 ) served as a general in three different armies the texian army , the united states army , and the confederate states army
he saw extensive combat during his 34 - year military career , fighting actions in the black hawk war , the texas war of independence , the mexican–american war , the utah war , and the american civil war
considered by confederate states president jefferson davis to be the finest general officer in the confederacy before the later emergence of robert lee , he was killed early in the civil war at the battle of shiloh on april 6 , 1862
johnston was the highest - ranking confederate officer killed during the entire war
davis believed the loss of general johnston was the turning point of our fate
johnston was born in washington , kentucky , the youngest son of dr
john and abigail ( harris ) johnston
his father was a native of salisbury , connecticut
although albert johnston was born in kentucky , he lived much of his life in texas , which he considered his home
he was first educated at transylvania university in lexington , kentucky , where he met fellow student jefferson davis
both were appointed to the united states military academy at west point , new york , davis two years behind johnston
in 1826 , chisholm , p
472 johnston graduated eighth of 41 cadets in his class from west point with a commission as a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd infantry
johnston was assigned to posts in new york and missouri and served in the brief black hawk war in 1832 as chief of staff to bvt
henry atkinson
in 1829 , he married henrietta preston , sister of kentucky politician and future civil war general william preston
they had one son , william preston johnston , who became a colonel in the confederate states army
the senior johnston resigned his commission in 1834 in order to care for his dying wife in kentucky , who succumbed two years later to tuberculosis
after serving as secretary of war for the republic of texas from 1838 to 1840 , johnston resigned and returned to kentucky
in 1843 , he married eliza griffin , his late wifes first cousin
the couple moved to texas , where they settled on a large plantation in brazoria county
johnston named the property china grove
here they raised johnstons two children from his first marriage and the first three children born to eliza and him
a sixth child was born later when the family lived in los angeles , where they had permanently settled
in 1836 , johnston moved to texas
he enlisted as a private in the texian army during the texas war of independence from the republic of mexico
he was named adjutant general as a colonel in the republic of texas army on august 5 , 1836
on january 31 , 1837 , he became senior brigadier general in command of the texas army
on february 5 , 1837 , he fought in a duel with texas brig
felix huston , who was angered and offended by johnstons promotion
johnston was shot through the hip and severely wounded , requiring him to relinquish his post during his recovery
on december 22 , 1838 , mirabeau lamar , the second president of the republic of texas , appointed johnston as secretary of war
he provided for the defense of the texas border against mexican invasion , and in 1839 conducted a campaign against indians in northern texas
in february 1840 , he resigned and returned to kentucky
johnston returned to texas during the mexican–american war ( 1846–1848 ) , under general zachary taylor as a colonel of the 1st texas rifle volunteers
the polk administrations preference for officers associated with the democratic party prevented the promotion of those , such as johnston , who were perceived as whigs
the enlistments of johnstons volunteers ran out just before the battle of monterrey
johnston convinced a few volunteers to stay and fight as he served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of monterrey and buena vista
future union general , joseph hooker , was with johnston at monterrey
hooker wrote it was through johnstons agency , mainly , that our division was saved from a cruel slaughter the coolness and magnificent presence that he displayed on this field left an impression on my mind that i have never forgotten
he remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by later 12th president zachary taylor to the army as a major and was made a paymaster in december 1849
he served in that role for more than five years , making six tours , and traveling more than annually on the indian frontier of texas
he served on the texas frontier at fort mason and elsewhere in the west
in 1855 , 14th president franklin pierce appointed him colonel of the new 2nd cavalry ( the unit that preceded the modern 5th ) , a new regiment , which he organized , his lieutenant colonel being robert lee , and his majors william hardee and george thomas
other subordinates in this unit included earl van dorn , edmund kirby smith , nathan evans , innis palmer , george stoneman , johnson , john hood , and charles field , all future civil war generals
as a key figure in the utah war , johnston took command of the s forces in november 1857
this army was sent to install alfred cummings as governor of the utah territory , in place of brigham young
after the army wintered at fort bridger , wyoming , a peaceful resolution was reached and in late june 1858 johnston led the army through salt lake city without incident to establish camp floyd some 50 miles distant
he received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in 1857 for his service in utah
he spent 1860 in kentucky until december 21 , when he sailed for california to take command of the department of the pacific
johnston was a proponent of slavery and a slaveholder
in 1846 , he owned a family of four slaves in texas
in 1855 , having discovered that a slave was stealing from the army payroll , johnston refused to have him physically punished and instead sold him for 1 , 000 to recoup the losses
johnston explained that whipping will not restore what is lost and it will not benefit the culprit , whom a lifetime of kind treatment has failed to make honest
in 1856 , he called abolitionism fanatical , idolotrous , negro worshipping in a letter to his son , fearing that the abolitionists would incite a servile insurrection in the south
upon moving to california , johnston sold one slave to his son and freed another , randolph or ran , who desired to accompany the family , on the condition of a 12 / month contract for five more years of servitude
ran accompanied johnston throughout the civil war , up until the latters death
johnstons wife , eliza , celebrated the lack of black people in california , writing where the darky is in any numbers it should be as slaves
at the outbreak of the american civil war , johnston was the commander of the army department of the pacific in california
like many regular army officers from the south , he was opposed to secession
but he resigned his commission soon after he heard of the secession of the southern states
it was accepted by the war department on may 6 , 1861 , effective may 3
on april 28 he moved to los angeles , the home of his wifes brother john griffin
considering staying in california with his wife and five children , johnston remained there until may
a sixth child was born in the family home at los angeles , where his eldest son , capt
albert johnston , jr
was later killed in an accidental explosion on a steamer ship while on liberty , in 1863
soon , johnston enlisted in the los angeles mounted rifles as a private , leaving warners ranch may 27
he participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to texas , crossing the colorado river into the confederate territory of arizona on july 4 , 1861
his escort was commanded by alonzo ridley , undersheriff of los angeles , who remained at johnstons side until he was killed
early in the civil war , confederate president jefferson davis decided that the confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible , and therefore distributed military forces around its borders and coasts
in the summer of 1861 , davis appointed several generals to defend confederate lines from the mississippi river east to the allegheny mountains
the most sensitive , and in many ways the most crucial areas , along the mississippi river and in western tennessee along the tennessee and the cumberland rivers were placed under the command of maj
leonidas polk and brig
gideon pillow
the latter had initially been in command in tennessee as that states top general
their impolitic occupation of columbus , kentucky , on september 3 , 1861 , two days before johnston arrived in the confederacys capital of richmond , virginia , after his cross - country journey , drove kentucky from its stated neutrality
the majority of kentuckians allied with the union camp
polk and pillows action gave union brig
ulysses grant an excuse to take control of the strategically located town of paducah , kentucky , without raising the ire of most kentuckians and the pro - union majority in the state legislature
on september 10 , 1861 , johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the confederacy west of the allegheny mountains , except for coastal areas
he became commander of the confederacys western armies in the area often called the western department or western military department
johnstons appointment as a full general by his friend and admirer jefferson davis already had been confirmed by the confederate senate on august 31 , 1861
the appointment had been backdated to rank from may 30 , 1861 , making him the second highest ranking general in the confederate states army
only adjutant general and inspector general samuel cooper ranked ahead of him
after his appointment , johnston immediately headed for his new territory
he was permitted to call on governors of arkansas , tennessee and mississippi for new troops , although this authority was largely stifled by politics , especially with respect to mississippi
on september 13 , 1861 , johnston ordered brig
felix zollicoffer with 4 , 000 men to occupy cumberland gap in kentucky in order to block union troops from coming into eastern tennessee
the kentucky legislature had voted to side with the union after the occupation of columbus by polk
by september 18 , johnston had brig
simon bolivar buckner with another 4 , 000 men blocking the railroad route to tennessee at bowling green , kentucky
johnston had fewer than 40 , 000 men spread throughout kentucky , tennessee , arkansas and missouri
of these , 10 , 000 were in missouri under missouri state guard maj
sterling price
johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors , but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had
as the confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the east , they gave johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material
johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did , a strategy that worked for several months
johnstons tactics had so annoyed and confused union brig
william tecumseh sherman in kentucky that he became paranoid and mentally unstable
sherman overestimated johnstons forces , and had to be relieved by brig
don carlos buell on november 9 , 1861
however , in his memoirs sherman strongly refutes this account
east tennessee ( a heavily pro - union region of the south during the civil war ) was held for the confederacy by two unimpressive brigadier generals appointed by jefferson davis felix zollicoffer , a brave but untrained and inexperienced officer , and soon - to - be maj
george crittenden , a former army officer with apparent alcohol problems while crittenden was away in richmond , zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper cumberland river near mill springs ( now nancy , kentucky ) , putting the river to his back and his forces into a trap
zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of union troops
when union brig
george thomas moved against the confederates , crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of thomass command at logans cross roads near mill springs before the union forces could unite
at the battle of mill springs on january 19 , 1862 , the ill - prepared confederates , after a night march in the rain , attacked the union force with some initial success
as the battle progressed , zollicoffer was killed , crittenden was unable to lead the confederate force ( he may have been intoxicated ) , and the confederates were turned back and routed by a union bayonet charge , suffering 533 casualties from their force of 4 , 000
the confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as general crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct
after the confederate defeat at the mill springs , davis sent johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements
he also assigned him gen
beauregard , who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war , and act as a competent subordinate for johnston
the brigade was led by brig
john floyd , considered incompetent
he took command at fort donelson as the senior general present just before union brig
ulysses grant attacked the fort
historians believe the assignment of beauregard to the west stimulated union commanders to attack the forts before beauregard could make a difference in the theater
union officers heard that he was bringing 15 regiments with him , but this was an exaggeration of his forces
based on the assumption that kentucky neutrality would act as a shield against a direct invasion from the north , circumstances that no longer applied in september 1861 , tennessee initially had sent men to virginia and concentrated defenses in the mississippi valley
even before johnston arrived in tennessee , construction of two forts had been started to defend the tennessee and the cumberland rivers , which provided avenues into the state from the north
both forts were located in tennessee in order to respect kentucky neutrality , but these were not in ideal locations
142 fort henry on the tennessee river was in an unfavorable low - lying location , commanded by hills on the kentucky side of the river
fort donelson on the cumberland river , although in a better location , had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats
polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command
after johnston took command , polk at first refused to comply with johnstons order to send an engineer , lt
joseph dixon , to inspect the forts
after johnston asserted his authority , polk had to allow dixon to proceed
dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened , although they were not in ideal locations , because much work had been done on them and the confederates might not have time to build new ones
johnston accepted his recommendations
johnston wanted major alexander stewart to command the forts but president davis appointed brig
lloyd tilghman as commander
to prevent polk from dissipating his forces by allowing some men to join a partisan group , johnston ordered him to send brig
gideon pillow and 5 , 000 men to fort donelson
pillow took up a position at nearby clarksville , tennessee and did not move into the fort until february 7 , 1862
alerted by a union reconnaissance on january 14 , 1862 , johnston ordered tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite fort henry , which polk had failed to do despite johnstons orders
tilghman failed to act decisively on these orders , which in any event were too late to be adequately carried out
beauregard arrived at johnstons headquarters at bowling green on february 4 , 1862 , and was given overall command of polks force at the western end of johnstons line at columbus , kentucky
on february 6 , 1862 , union navy gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of ill - sited fort henry , inflicting 21 casualties on the small remaining confederate force
lloyd tilghman surrendered the 94 remaining officers and men of his approximately 3 , 000 - man force which had not been sent to fort donelson before grants force could even take up their positions
johnston knew he could be trapped at bowling green if fort donelson fell , so he moved his force to nashville , the capital of tennessee and an increasingly important confederate industrial center , beginning on february 11 , 1862
johnston also reinforced fort donelson with 12 , 000 more men , including those under floyd and pillow , a curious decision in view of his thought that the union gunboats alone might be able to take the fort
he did order the commanders of the fort to evacuate the troops if the fort could not be held
the senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison , gideon pillow and john floyd , squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on february 16 , 1862 , brig
simon buckner , having been abandoned by floyd and pillow , surrendered fort donelson
colonel nathan bedford forrest escaped with his cavalry force of about 700 men before the surrender
the confederates suffered about 1 , 500 casualties with an estimated 12 , 000 to 14 , 000 taken prisoner
union casualties were 500 killed , 2 , 108 wounded , 224 missing
johnston , who had little choice in allowing floyd and pillow to take charge at fort donelson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison , took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because a full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the confederate position
his passive defensive performance while positioning himself in a forward position at bowling green , spreading his forces too thinly , not concentrating his forces in the face of union advances , and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians
the fall of the forts exposed nashville to imminent attack , and it fell without resistance to union forces under brig
buell on february 25 , 1862 , two days after johnston had to pull his forces out in order to avoid having them captured as well
johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territory and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off
johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command , the army of central kentucky , from the vicinity of nashville
with beauregards help , mcpherson , p
johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under polk and now already under beauregards command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of corinth , mississippi , which he reached by a circuitous route
johnston kept the union forces , now under the overall command of the ponderous maj
henry halleck , confused and hesitant to move , allowing johnston to reach his objective undetected
this delay allowed jefferson davis finally to send reinforcements from the garrisons of coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly general , braxton bragg , to help organize the western forces
bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk , who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces , before johnstons arrival on march 24 , 1862
johnstons army of 17 , 000 men gave the confederates a combined force of about 40 , 000 to 44 , 669 men at corinth
on march 29 , 1862 , johnston officially took command of this combined force , which continued to use the army of the mississippi name under which it had been organized by beauregard on march 5
johnston now planned to defeat the union forces piecemeal before the various union units in kentucky and tennessee under grant with 40 , 000 men at nearby pittsburg landing , tennessee , and the now maj
don carlos buell on his way from nashville with 35 , 000 men , could unite against him
johnston started his army in motion on april 3 , 1862 , intent on surprising grants force as soon as the next day , but they moved slowly due to their inexperience , bad roads , and lack of adequate staff planning
due to the delays , as well as several contacts with the enemy , johnstons second in command , beauregard , felt the element of surprise had been lost and recommended calling off the attack
johnston decided to proceed as planned , stating i would fight them if they were a million
his army was finally in position within a mile or two of grants force , and undetected , by the evening of april 5 , 1862
johnston launched a massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against grant at the battle of shiloh on april 6 , 1862
as the confederate forces overran the union camps , johnston personally rallied troops up and down the line on his horse
one of his famous moments in the battle occurred when he witnessed some of his soldiers breaking from the ranks to pillage and loot the union camps , and was outraged to see a young lieutenant among them
none of that , sir , johnston roared at the officer , we are not here for plunder
then , realizing he had embarrassed the man , he picked up a tin cup from a table and announced , let this be my share of the spoils today , before directing his army onward
at about 230pm , while leading one of those charges against a union camp near the peach orchard , he was wounded , taking a bullet behind his right knee
the bullet clipped a part of his popliteal artery and his boot filled up with blood
there were no medical personnel on scene at the time , since johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded confederate troops and union prisoners earlier in the battle
within a few minutes , johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting
among his staff was isham harris , the governor of tennessee , who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that abraham lincoln had appointed andrew johnson as military governor of tennessee
seeing johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale , harris asked general , are you wounded johnston glanced down at his leg wound , then faced harris and replied in a weak voice his last words yes and i fear seriously
harris and other staff officers removed johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the hornets nest and desperately tried to aid the general , who had lost consciousness by this point
harris then sent an aide to fetch johnstons surgeon but did not apply a tourniquet to johnsons wounded leg
a few minutes later , before a doctor could be found , johnston died from blood loss
it is believed that johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound
ironically , it was later discovered that johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket when he died
harris and the other officers wrapped general johnstons body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops morale with the sight of the dead general
johnston and his wounded horse , fire eater , were taken to his field headquarters on the corinth road , where his body remained in his tent for the remainder of the battle
beauregard assumed command of the army and resumed leading the confederate assault , which continued advancing and pushed the union force back to a final defensive line near the tennessee river
with his army exhausted and daylight almost gone , beauregard called off the final confederate attack around 1900 hours , figuring he could finish off the union army the following morning
however , grant was reinforced by 20 , 000 fresh troops from don carlos buells army of the ohio during the night , and led a successful counter - attack the following day , driving the confederates from the field and winning the battle
as the confederate army retreated back to corinth , johnstons body was taken to the home of colonel william inge , which had been his headquarters in corinth
it was covered in the confederate flag and lay in state for several hours
it is possible that a confederate soldier fired the fatal round , as many confederates were firing at the union lines while johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers
alonzo ridley of los angeles commanded the bodyguard “the guides” of gen
johnston , and was by his side when he fell
johnston was the highest - ranking fatality of the war on either side , and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the confederacy
at the time , davis considered him the best general in the country
johnston was survived by his wife eliza and six children
his wife and five younger children , including one born after he went to war , chose to live out their days at home in los angeles with elizas brother , dr
john strother griffin
upon his passing general johnston received the highest praise ever given by the confederate government accounts were published , on december 20 , 1862 , and thereafter , in the los angeles star of his familys hometown
johnston street , hancock street , and griffin avenue , each in northeast los angeles , are named after the general and his family , who lived in the neighborhood
johnston was initially buried in new orleans
in 1866 , a joint resolution of the texas legislature was passed to have his body moved and reinterred at the texas state cemetery in austin
the re - interment occurred in 1867
the texas historical commission has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once johnstons plantation
an adjacent marker was erected by the san jacinto chapter of the daughters of the republic of texas and the lee , roberts , and davis chapter of the united daughters of the confederate states of america
in 1916 , the university of texas at austin recognized several confederate veterans ( including johnston ) with statues on its south mall
on august 21 , 2017 , as part of the wave of confederate monument removals in america , johnstons statue was taken down
plans were announced to add it to the briscoe center for american history on the east side of the university campus
in the fall of 2018 , johnston elementary school in dallas , texas , was renamed cedar crest elementary
johnston middle school in houston , texas was also renamed to meyerland middle school
three additional elementary schools named for confederate veterans were renamed at the same time
an android is a humanoid robot often made from a flesh - like material
historically , androids were completely within the domain of science fiction and frequently seen in film and television , but recent advances in robot technology now allow the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots
while the term android is used in reference to human - looking robots in general ( not necessarily male - looking humanoid robots ) , a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as a gynoid
besides one can refer to robots without alluding to their sexual appearance by calling them anthrobots ( merging the radical anthrōpos and the word robot ; see anthrobotics ) or anthropoids ( short for anthropoid robots ; the term humanoids is not appropriate because it is already commonly used to refer to human - like organic species in the context of scientific fiction , futurism and speculative astrobiology )
the oxford english dictionary traces the earliest use ( as androides ) to ephraim chambers 1728 cyclopaedia , in reference to an automaton that st
albertus magnus allegedly created
by the late 1700s , androides , elaborate mechanical devices resembling humans performing human activities , were displayed in exhibit halls
the term android appears in us patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human - like toy automatons
the term android was used in a more modern sense by the french author auguste villiers de lisle - adam in his work tomorrows eve ( 1886 )
this story features an artificial humanlike robot named hadaly
as said by the officer in the story , in this age of realien advancement , who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls
the term made an impact into english pulp science fiction starting from jack williamsons the cometeers ( 1936 ) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by edmond hamiltons captain future stories ( 1940–1944 )
although karel čapeks robots in ( rossums universal robots ) ( 1921 ) —the play that introduced the word robot to the world—were organic artificial humans , the word robot has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans , animals , and other beings
the term android can mean either one of these , while a cyborg ( cybernetic organism or bionic man ) would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts
the term droid , popularized by george lucas in the original star wars film and now used widely within science fiction , originated as an abridgment of android , but has been used by lucas and others to mean any robot , including distinctly non - human form machines like r2 - d2
the word android was used in star trek the original series episode what are little girls made of the abbreviation andy , coined as a pejorative by writer philip dick in his novel do androids dream of electric sheep , has seen some further usage , such as within the tv series total recall 2070
authors have used the term android in more diverse ways than robot or cyborg
in some fictional works , the difference between a robot and android is only superficial , with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot - like internal mechanics
in other stories , authors have used the word android to mean a wholly organic , yet artificial , creation
other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between
eric wilson , who defines an android as a synthetic human being , distinguishes between three types of android , based on their bodys composition
although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots , the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts simulacra ( devices that exhibit likeness ) and automata ( devices that have independence )
several projects aiming to create androids that look , and , to a certain degree , speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway
in 1984 , wabot - 2 was revealed , and made a number of improvements
it was capable of playing the organ
wabot - 2 had ten fingers and two feet , and was able to read a score of music
it was also able to accompany a person
the intelligent robotics lab , directed by hiroshi ishiguro at osaka university , and the kokoro company demonstrated the actroid at expo 2005 in aichi prefecture , japan and released the telenoid r1 in 2010
in 2006 , kokoro developed a new der 2 android
the height of the human body part of der2 is 165cm
there are 47 mobile points
der2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body
the air servosystem which kokoro developed originally is used for the actuator
as a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem , the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise
der2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder
outwardly der2 has a more beautiful proportion
compared to the previous model , der2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions
once programmed , it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice
the intelligent mechatronics lab , directed by hiroshi kobayashi at the tokyo university of science , has developed an android head called saya , which was exhibited at robodex 2002 in yokohama , japan
there are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time , which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future
now saya is working at the science university of tokyo as a guide
the waseda university ( japan ) and ntt docomos manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape - shifting robot wd - 2
it is capable of changing its face
at first , the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline , eyes , nose , and so on of a certain person
the robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions , they say
the first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003
after that , a year later , they made a couple of major improvements to the design
the robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy
it uses a driving system with a 3dof unit
the wd - 2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask , with each point possessing three degrees of freedom
this one has 17 facial points , for a total of 56 degrees of freedom
as for the materials they used , the wd - 2s mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called septom , with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength
other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point , driven by a dc motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw
apparently , the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces
to copy a face , they need only a 3d scanner to determine the locations of an individuals 17 facial points
after that , they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards
in addition , the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individuals hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3d mask
prof nadia thalmann , a nanyang technological university scientist , directed efforts of the institute for media innovation along with the school of computer engineering in the development of a social robot , nadine
nadine is powered by software similar to apples siri or microsofts cortana
nadine may become a personal assistant in offices and homes in future , or she may become a companion for the young and the elderly
assoc prof gerald seet from the school of mechanical aerospace engineering and the beingthere centre led a three - year rd development in tele - presence robotics , creating edgar
a remote user can control edgar with the users face and expressions displayed on the robots face in real time
the robot also mimics their upper body movements
kitech researched and developed ever - 1 , an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial musculature and capable of rudimentary conversation , having a vocabulary of around 400 words
she is , matching the average figure of a korean woman in her twenties
ever - 1s name derives from the biblical eve , plus the letter r for robot
ever - 1s advanced computing processing power enables speech recognition and vocal synthesis , at the same time processing lip synchronization and visual recognition by 90 - degree micro - ccd cameras with face recognition technology
an independent microchip inside her artificial brain handles gesture expression , body coordination , and emotion expression
her whole body is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly silicon and with 60 artificial joints in her face , neck , and lower body ; she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing
in south korea , the ministry of information and communication has an ambitious plan to put a robot in every household by 2020
the new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers , as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions
the countrys new robotics ethics charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future , setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers , as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa
walt disney and a staff of imagineers created great moments with mr
lincoln that debuted at the 1964 new york worlds fair
william barry , an education futurist and former visiting west point professor of philosophy and ethical reasoning at the united states military academy , created an ai android character named maria bot
this interface ai android was named after the infamous fictional robot maria in the 1927 film metropolis , as a well - behaved distant relative
maria bot is the first ai android teaching assistant at the university level
maria bot has appeared as a keynote speaker as a duo with barry for a tedx talk in everett , washington in february 2020
resembling a human from the shoulders up , maria bot is a virtual being android that has complex facial expressions and head movement and engages in conversation about a variety of subjects
she uses ai to process and synthesize information to make her own decisions on how to talk and engage
she collects data through conversations , direct data inputs such as books or articles , and through internet sources
maria bot was built by an international high - tech company for barry to help improve education quality and eliminate education poverty
maria bot is designed to create new ways for students to engage and discuss ethical issues raised by the increasing presence of robots and artificial intelligence
barry also uses maria bot to demonstrate that programming a robot with life - affirming , ethical framework makes them more likely to help humans to do the same
hanson robotics , inc
, of texas and kaist produced an android portrait of albert einstein , using hansons facial android technology mounted on kaists life - size walking bipedal robot body
this einstein android , also called albert hubo , thus represents the first full - body walking android in history
and the university of texas at arlington also developed the android portrait of sci - fi author philip dick ( creator of do androids dream of electric sheep , the basis for the film blade runner ) , with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the authors works
in 2005 , the pkd android won a first - place artificial intelligence award from aaai
androids are a staple of science fiction
isaac asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the science of robotics and artificial intelligence , notably in his 1950s series i , robot
one thing common to most fictional androids is that the real - life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human - like robots—such as the creation of strong artificial intelligence—are assumed to have been solved
van riper , op
fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans—moving , thinking and speaking as fluidly as them
the tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance—or even human ambitions—of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions
some android heroes seek , like pinocchio , to become human , as in the film bicentennial man , or data in star trek the next generation
others , as in the film westworld , rebel against abuse by careless humans
android hunter deckard in do androids dream of electric sheep and its film adaptation blade runner discovers that his targets appear to be , in some ways , more human than he is
android stories , therefore , are not essentially stories about androids ; they are stories about the human condition and what it means to be human
one aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring racism in society , as in blade runner
more recently , the androids bishop and annalee call in the films aliens and alien resurrection are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an other
the 2018 video game detroit become human also explores how androids are treated as second class citizens in a near future society
female androids , or gynoids , are often seen in science fiction , and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical perfect woman
although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism and misogyny in society
the 2015 japanese film sayonara , starring geminoid f , was promoted as the first movie to feature an android performing opposite a human actor
alberta is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of canada
it is part of western canada and is one of the three prairie provinces
alberta is bordered by british columbia to the west , saskatchewan to the east , the northwest territories ( nwt ) to the north , and the state of montana to the south
it is one of the only two landlocked provinces in canada ( saskatchewan being the other )
alberta is the 4th largest province by area at and the 4th most populous , being home to 4 , 262 , 635 people
albertas capital is edmonton , while calgary is its largest city
more than half of albertans live in either edmonton or calgary , which contributes to continuing the rivalry between the two cities
english is the official language of the province
in 2016 , 76 of albertans were anglophone , 1 were francophone and 22 were allophone
albertas economy is based on hydrocarbons , petrochemical industries , livestock and agriculture
the oil and gas industry has been a pillar of albertas economy since 1947 , when substantial oil deposits were discovered at leduc no
billion , 15 of canadas gdp
in the past , albertas political landscape hosted parties like the centre - left liberals and the agrarian united farmers of alberta
today , alberta is generally perceived as a conservative province
the right - wing social credit party held office continually from 1935 to 1971 before the centre - right progressive conservatives held office continually from 1971 to 2015 , the latter being the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial or federal level in canadian history
before becoming part of canada , alberta was home to several first nations like plain indians and woodland cree
it was also a territory used by fur traders of the rival companies hbc and nwc
the dominion of canada bought the lands that would become alberta as part of the nwt in 1870
massive oil reserves were discovered in 1947
the exploitation of oil sands began in 1967
alberta is renowned for its natural beauty , richness in fossils and for housing important nature reserves
alberta is home to six unesco designated world heritage sites the canadian rocky mountain parks , dinosaur provincial park , the head - smashed - in buffalo jump , waterton - glacier international peace park , wood buffalo national park and writing - on - stone provincial park
other popular sites include banff national park , elk island national park , jasper national park , waterton lakes national park , and drumheller
the name alberta itself is a feminine latinized form of albert , the name of princess louises father , the prince consort ( germanic cognates , ultimately derived from the proto - germanic language aþalaberhtaz ( compound of noble bright / famous )
albertas southern border is the 49th parallel north , which separates it from the state of montana
the 60th parallel north divides alberta from the northwest territories
the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of saskatchewan ; while on the west its boundary with british columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the northwest territories at 60°n until it reaches the continental divide at the rocky mountains , and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the continental divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the montana border at 49°n
the province extends east to west at its maximum width
its highest point is on the slave river in wood buffalo national park in the northeast
with the exception of the semi - arid climate of the steppe in the south - eastern section , the province has adequate water resources
there are numerous rivers and lakes in alberta used for swimming , fishing and a range of water sports
there are three large lakes , lake claire , and lake athabasca ( from the columbia icefield in the rocky mountains to lake athabasca
the largest river is the peace river with an average flow of
the peace river originates in the rocky mountains of northern british columbia and flows through northern alberta and into the slave river , a tributary of the mackenzie river
albertas capital city , edmonton , is located at about the geographic centre of the province
it is the most northerly major city in canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern canada
with its proximity to canadas largest oil fields , the region has most of western canadas oil refinery capacity
calgary is about north of montana , surrounded by extensive ranching country
almost 75 of the provinces population lives in the calgary–edmonton corridor
the land grant policy to the railways served as a means to populate the province in its early years
most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest , while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely temperate coniferous forests of the alberta mountain forests and alberta–british columbia foothills forests
the southern quarter of the province is prairie , ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it
the central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests , from calgary , north to edmonton , and then east to lloydminster , contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population
much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming , with mixed farming more common in the north and centre , while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south
the alberta badlands are located in southeastern alberta , where the red deer river crosses the flat prairie and farmland , and features deep canyons and striking landforms dinosaur provincial park , near brooks , showcases the badlands terrain , desert flora , and remnants from albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape
northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate
the agricultural area of southern alberta has a semi - arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants
the southeastern corner of alberta , part of the palliser triangle , experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province , and as a result , suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts
western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds
central and parts of northwestern alberta in the peace river region are largely aspen parkland , a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north
alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters
the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north , which often produce cold winter conditions
as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta , the temperature can change rapidly
arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from in southern alberta , although temperatures at these extremes are rare
in the summer , continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from in southeastern alberta
in the rocky mountain valleys and far north , up to around in the dry prairie of the southeast
the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures
the south and east - central portions are prone to drought - like conditions sometimes persisting for several years , although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation , sometimes resulting in flooding
in the winter , the alberta clipper , a type of intense , fast - moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and , pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream , descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states
in just one hour
the region around lethbridge has the most chinooks , averaging 30 to 35 chinook days per year
calgary has a 56 chance of a white christmas , while edmonton has an 86 chance
after saskatchewan , alberta experiences the most tornadoes in canada with an average of 15 verified per year
thunderstorms , some of them severe , are frequent in the summer , especially in central and southern alberta
the region surrounding the calgary–edmonton corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in canada , which is caused by orographic lifting from the nearby rocky mountains , enhancing the updraft / downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail
in central and northern alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the prairie crocus ( pulsatilla nuttalliana ) anemone ; this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as march , though april is the usual month for the general population
members of the sunflower ( helianthus ) family blossom on the prairie in the summer months between july and september
which dries up as summer lengthens , to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower ( ratibida ) , fleabane , and sage ( artemisia )
both yellow and white sweet clover ( melilotus ) can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province
the trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides
these are largely deciduous , typically aspen , poplar , and willow
many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain
north of the north saskatchewan river , evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres
aspen poplar , balsam poplar ( populus balsamifera ) ( or in some parts cottonwood ( populus deltoides ) , and paper birch ( betula papyrifera ) are the primary large deciduous species
conifers include jack pine ( pinus banksiana ) , rocky mountain pine , lodgepole pine ( pinus contorta ) , both white and black spruce , and the deciduous conifer tamarack ( larix laricina )
the four climatic regions ( alpine , boreal forest , parkland , and prairie ) of alberta are home to many different species of animals
the south and central prairie was the homeland of the american bison , also known as buffalo , with its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo
the buffalo population was decimated during early settlement , but since then , buffalo have made a comeback , living on farms and in parks all over alberta
herbivores are found throughout the province
moose , mule deer , elk , and white - tailed deer are found in the wooded regions , and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern alberta
bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the rocky mountains
rabbits , porcupines , skunks , squirrels , and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province
alberta is home to only one venomous snake species , the prairie rattlesnake
alberta is home to many large carnivores such as wolves , grizzly bears , black bears , and mountain lions , which are found in the mountains and wooded regions
smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes , red foxes , canada lynx , and bobcats
wolverines can also be found in the northwestern areas of the province
central and northern alberta and the region farther north are the nesting ground of many migratory birds
vast numbers of ducks , geese , swans and pelicans arrive in alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern alberta
eagles , hawks , owls , and crows are plentiful , and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect - eating birds can be found
alberta , like other temperate regions , is home to mosquitoes , flies , wasps , and bees
rivers and lakes are populated with pike , walleye , whitefish , rainbow , speckled , brown trout , and sturgeon
native to the province , the bull trout , is the provincial fish and an official symbol of alberta
turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province
frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in alberta
alberta is the only province in canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of norwegian rats
since the early 1950s , the government of alberta has operated a rat - control program , which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported , usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail
in 2006 , alberta agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats ; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners
it is illegal for individual albertans to own or keep norwegian rats of any description ; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos , universities and colleges , and recognized research institutions
in 2009 , several rats were
alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of late cretaceous dinosaur fossils worldwide
taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons , isolated material , microvertebrate remains , and even mass graves
at least 38 dinosaur type specimens were collected in the province
the foremost formation , oldman formation and dinosaur park formations collectively comprise the judith river group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur - bearing strata in alberta
dinosaur - bearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta
the dinosaur provincial park area contains outcrops of the dinosaur park formation and oldman formation
in albertas central and southern regions are intermittent scollard formation outcrops
in the drumheller valley and edmonton regions there are exposed horseshoe canyon facies
other formations have been recorded as well , like the milk river and foremost formations
the latter two have a lower diversity of documented dinosaurs , primarily due to their lower total fossil quantity and neglect from collectors who are hindered by the isolation and scarcity of exposed outcrops
their dinosaur fossils are primarily teeth recovered from microvertebrate fossil sites
additional geologic formations that have produced only a few fossils are the belly river group and st
mary river formations of the southwest and the northwestern wapiti formation , which contains two pachyrhinosaurus bone beds
the bearpaw formation represents strata deposited during a marine transgression
dinosaurs are known from this formation , but represent specimens washed out to sea or reworked from older sediments

paleo - indians arrived in alberta at least 10 , 000 years ago , toward the end of the last ice age
they are thought to have migrated from siberia to alaska on a land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas
others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland
over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples , including the plains indians of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree , who generally lived by hunting buffalo , and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted , trapped , and fished for a living
after the british arrival in canada , approximately half of the province of alberta , south of the athabasca river drainage , became part of ruperts land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay
this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudsons bay company ( hbc ) in 1670 , and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it
the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay , and they were prime habitats for fur - bearing animals
the first european explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond , who learned of the methye portage , which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of ruperts land
other north american fur traders formed the north west company ( nwc ) of montreal to compete with the hbc in 1779
the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory
peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in 1778
roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in 1788
his cousin , sir alexander mackenzie , followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton , then setting northward on foot , trekked to the athabasca river , which he followed to lake athabasca
it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the mackenzie river—which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean
returning to lake athabasca , he followed the peace river upstream , eventually reaching the pacific ocean , and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexico
the extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french ( and spanish ) territory of louisiana and was sold to the united states in 1803
in the treaty of 1818 , the portion of louisiana north of the forty - ninth parallel was ceded to great britain
fur trade expanded in the north , but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc , and in 1821 the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities
the amalgamated hudsons bay company dominated trade in alberta until 1870 when the newly formed canadian government purchased ruperts land
northern alberta was included in the north - western territory until 1870 , when it and ruperts land became canadas north - west territories
first nations negotiated the numbered treaties with the crown in which the crown gained title to the land that would later become alberta , and the crown committed to the ongoing support of the first nations and guaranteed their hunting and fishing rights
the most significant treaties for alberta are treaty 6 ( 1876 ) , treaty 7 ( 1877 ) and treaty 8 ( 1899 )
the district of alberta was created as part of the north - west territories in 1882
as settlement increased , local representatives to the north - west legislative assembly were added
after a long campaign for autonomy , in 1905 , the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status , with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premier
less than a decade later , the first world war presented special challenges to the new province as an extraordinary number of volunteers left relatively few workers to maintain services and production
over 50 of albertas doctors volunteered for service overseas
on june 21 , 2013 , during the 2013 alberta floods alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the bow , elbow , highwood and oldman rivers and tributaries
a dozen municipalities in southern alberta declared local states of emergency on june 21 as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders
in 2016 , the fort mcmurray wildfire resulted in the largest fire evacuation of residents in albertas history , as more than 80 , 000 people were ordered to evacuate
the 2021 canadian census reported alberta had a population of 4 , 262 , 635 living in 1 , 633 , 220 of its 1 , 772 , 670 total dwellings , an 4 change from its 2016 population of 4 , 067 , 175
with a land area of in 2021
statistics canada estimated the province to have a population of 4 , 464 , 170 in q4 of 2021
since 2000 , albertas population has experienced a relatively high rate of growth , mainly because of its burgeoning economy
between 2003 and 2004 , the province had high birthrates ( on par with some larger provinces such as british columbia ) , relatively high immigration , and a high rate of interprovincial migration compared to other provinces
about 81 of the population lives in urban areas and only about 19 in rural areas
the calgary–edmonton corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of canada
albertas population rose from 73 , 022 in 1901
according to the 2016 census alberta has 779 , 155 residents ( 19 ) between the ages of 0–14 , 2 , 787 , 805 residents ( 68 ) between the ages of 15–64 , and 500 , 215 residents ( 12 ) aged 65 and over

alberta has considerable ethnic diversity
in line with the rest of canada , many are descended from immigrants of western european nations , notably england , scotland , ireland , wales and france , but large numbers later came from other regions of europe , notably germany , ukraine and scandinavia
according to statistics canada , alberta is home to the second - highest proportion ( 2 ) of francophones in western canada ( after manitoba )
despite this , relatively few albertans claim french as their mother tongue
many of albertas french - speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province , after migration from other areas of canada or descending from métis
as reported in the 2001 census , the chinese represented nearly 4 of albertas population , and south asians represented more than 2
both edmonton and calgary have historic chinatowns , and calgary has canadas third - largest chinese community
the chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the canadian pacific railway in the 1880s
indigenous albertans makeup approximately 3 of the population
in the 2006 canadian census , the most commonly reported ethnic origins among albertans were 885 , 825 english ( 27 ) ; 679 , 705 german ( 20 ) ; 667 , 405 canadian ( 20 ) ; 661 , 265 scottish ( 20 ) ; 539 , 160 irish ( 16 ) ; 388 , 210 french ( 11 ) ; 332 , 180 ukrainian ( 10 ) ; 172 , 910 dutch ( 5 ) ; 170 , 935 polish ( 5 ) ; 169 , 355 north american indian ( 5 ) ; 144 , 585 norwegian ( 4 ) ; and 137 , 600 chinese ( 4 )
( each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable
) amongst those of british heritage , the scots have had a particularly strong influence on place - names , with the names of many cities and towns including calgary , airdrie , canmore , and banff having scottish origins
alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of visible minorities after british columbia and ontario with 13 of the population consisting of visible minorities in 2006
aboriginal identity peoples made up 5 of the population in 2006 , about half of whom consist of first nations and the other half are métis
there are also a small number of inuit people in alberta
the remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations , none of which constituted more than 2 of the population
members of lds church are mostly concentrated in the extreme south of the province
alberta has a population of hutterites , a communal anabaptist sect similar to the mennonites , and has a significant population of seventh - day adventists
alberta is home to several byzantine rite churches as part of the legacy of eastern european immigration , including the ukrainian catholic eparchy of edmonton , and the ukrainian orthodox church of canadas western diocese which is based in edmonton
muslims made up 3 of the population , sikhs 1 , buddhists 1 , and hindus 1
many of these are immigrants , but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies
canadas oldest mosque , the al - rashid mosque , is located in edmonton , alberta is also home to a growing jewish population of about 15 , 400 people who constituted 0 of albertas population
most of albertas jews live in the metropolitan areas of calgary ( 8 , 200 ) and edmonton ( 5 , 500 )
albertas economy was one of the strongest in the world , supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent , agriculture and technology
in 2013 , albertas per capita gdp exceeded that of the united states , norway , or switzerland , according to the 2006 census ,
albertas debt - to - gdp ratio is projected to peak at 12 in fiscal year 2021–2022 , falling to 11 the following year
the calgary - edmonton corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in canada
the region covers a distance of roughly it is also one of the fastest - growing regions in the country
a 2003 study by td bank financial group found the corridor to be the only canadian urban centre to amass a united states level of wealth while maintaining a canadian style quality of life , offering universal health care benefits
the study found that gdp per capita in the corridor was 10 above average united states metropolitan areas and 40 above other canadian cities at that time
the fraser institute states that alberta also has very high levels of economic freedom and rates alberta as the freest economy in canada ,
in 2014 , merchandise exports totalled us121billion
energy revenues totalled 111billion and energy resource exports totalled 90billion
farm cash receipts from agricultural products totalled 12billion
shipments of forest products totalled 5billion while exports were 2billion
manufacturing sales totalled 79billion , and albertas information and communications technology ( ict ) industries generated over 13billion in revenue
in total , albertas 2014 gdp amassed 364billion in 2007 dollars , or 414billion in 2015 dollars
in 2015 , albertas gdp grew unstably despite low oil prices , with growth rates as high 4 and as low as 0
agriculture has a significant position in the provinces economy
the province has over three million head of cattle , and alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market
nearly one half of all canadian beef is produced in alberta
alberta is one of the top producers of plains buffalo ( bison ) for the consumer market
sheep for wool and mutton are also raised
wheat and canola are primary farm crops , with alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production ; other grains are also prominent
much of the farming is dryland farming , often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation
continuous cropping ( in which there is no fallow season ) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion
across the province , the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing ; farmers typically truck the grain to central points
alberta is the leading beekeeping province of canada , with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern alberta , then migrating north during the summer into the peace river valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed
hybrid canola also requires bee pollination , and some beekeepers service this need
forestry plays a vital role in albertas economy , providing over 15 , 000 jobs and contributing billions of dollars annually
uses for harvested timber include pulpwood , hardwood , engineered wood and bioproducts such as chemicals and biofuels
alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil , synthetic crude , natural gas and gas products in canada
alberta is the worlds second - largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth - largest producer
two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in north america are located in central and north - central alberta
in both red deer and edmonton , polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world
edmontons oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of edmonton
the athabasca oil sands surrounding fort mcmurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world , estimated to be 1trillion barrels ( 254km3 )
many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non - conventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands
as of late 2006 , there were over 100billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern alberta
another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil
the oil price increases since 2003 have made it profitable to extract this oil , which in the past would give little profit or even a loss
by mid - 2014 , rising costs and stabilizing oil prices threatened the economic viability of some projects
an example of this was the shelving of the joslyn north project in the athabasca region in may 2014
with concerted effort and support from the provincial government , several high - tech industries have found their birth in alberta , notably patents related to interactive liquid - crystal display systems with a growing economy , alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds
alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the 20th century , with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing , hiking , and camping , shopping locales such as west edmonton mall , calgary stampede , outdoor festivals , professional athletic events , international sporting competitions such as the commonwealth games and olympic games , as well as more eclectic attractions
according to alberta economic development , calgary and edmonton both host over four million visitors annually
banff , jasper and the rocky mountains are visited by about three million people per year
alberta tourism relies heavily on southern ontario tourists , as well as tourists from other parts of canada , the united states , and many other countries
there are also natural attractions like elk island national park , wood buffalo national park , and the columbia icefield
albertas rockies include well - known tourist destinations banff national park and jasper national park
the two mountain parks are connected by the scenic icefields parkway
banff is located west of edmonton on the yellowhead highway
five of canadas fourteen unesco world heritage sites are located within the province canadian rocky mountain parks , waterton - glacier international peace park , wood buffalo national park , dinosaur provincial park and head - smashed - in buffalo jump
a number of these areas hold ski resorts , most notably banff sunshine , lake louise , marmot basin , norquay and nakiska
about 1million people visit the calgary stampede , edmonton was the gateway to the only all - canadian route to the yukon gold fields , and the only route which did not require gold - seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous chilkoot pass
another tourist destination that draws more than 650 , 000 visitors each year is the drumheller valley , located northeast of calgary
drumheller , dinosaur capital of the world , offers the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology
drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of western canadas largest coal producers during the war years
another attraction in east - central alberta is alberta prairie railway excursions , a popular tourist attraction operated out of stettler , that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year
the government of alberta is organized as a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral legislature
its unicameral legislature—the legislative assembly—consists of 87 members elected first past the post ( fptp ) from single - member constituencies
locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately
their boundaries do not necessarily coincide
as queen of canada , elizabeth ii is the head of state for the government of alberta
her duties in alberta are carried out by lieutenant governor salma lakhani
the queen and lieutenant governor are figureheads whose actions are highly restricted by custom and constitutional convention
the lieutenant governor handles numerous honorific duties in the name of the queen
the government is headed by the premier
the premier is normally a member of the legislative assembly , and draws all the members of the cabinet from among the members of the legislative assembly
the city of edmonton is the seat of the provincial government—the capital of alberta
the premier is jason kenney , sworn in on april30 , 2019
albertas elections have tended to yield much more conservative outcomes than those of other canadian provinces
since the 1960s , alberta has had three main political parties , the progressive conservatives ( conservatives or tories ) , the liberals , and the social democratic new democrats
the wildrose party , a more conservative party formed in early 2008 , gained much support in the 2012 election and became the official opposition , a role it held until 2017 when it was dissolved and succeeded by the new united conservative party created by the merger of wildrose and the progressive conservatives
the strongly conservative social credit party was a power in alberta for many decades , but fell from the political map after the progressive conservatives came to power in 1971
for 44 years the progressive conservatives governed alberta
they lost the 2015 election to the ndp ( which formed their own government for the first time in provincial history , breaking almost 80 consecutive years of right - wing rule ) , since becoming a province in 1905 , alberta has seen only five changes of government—only six parties have governed alberta the liberals , from 1905 to 1921 ; the united farmers of alberta , from 1921 to 1935 ; the social credit party , from 1935 to 1971 ; the progressive conservative party , from 1971 to 2015 ; from 2015 to 2019 , the alberta new democratic party ; and from 2019 , the united conservative party , with the most recent transfer of power being the first time in provincial history that an incumbent government was not returned to a second term
the province is divided into ten types of local governments – urban municipalities ( including cities , towns , villages and summer villages ) , specialized municipalities , rural municipalities ( including municipal districts ( often named as counties ) , improvement districts , and special areas ) , métis settlements , and indian reserves
all types of municipalities are governed by local residents and were incorporated under various provincial acts , with the exception of improvement districts ( governed by either the provincial or federal government ) , and indian reserves ( governed by local band governments under federal jurisdiction )
policing in the province of alberta upon its creation was the responsibility of the royal northwest mounted police
in 1917 , due to pressures of the first world war , the alberta provincial police was created
this organization policed the province until it was disbanded as a great depression - era cost - cutting measure in 1932
it was at that time the , now renamed , royal canadian mounted police resumed policing of the province , specifically rcmp k division
with the advent of the alberta sheriffs branch , the distribution of duties of law enforcement in alberta has been evolving as certain aspects , such as traffic enforcement , mobile surveillance and the close protection of the premier of alberta have been transferred to the sheriffs
in 2006 , alberta formed the alberta law enforcement response teams ( alert ) to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it
alert is made up of members of the rcmp , sheriffs branch , and various major municipal police forces in alberta
military bases in alberta include canadian forces base ( cfb ) cold lake , cfb edmonton , cfb suffield and cfb wainwright
air force units stationed at cfb cold lake have access to the cold lake air weapons range
cfb suffield hosts british troops and is the largest training facility in canada
according to albertas 2009 budget , government revenue in that year came mainly from royalties on non - renewable natural resources ( 30 ) , personal income taxes ( 22 ) , corporate and other taxes ( 19 ) , and grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects ( 9 )
according to the 2018–2021 fiscal plan , the two top sources of revenue in 2016 were personal income tax at 10 , 763million and federal transfers of 7 , 976million with total resource revenue at 3 , 097million
alberta is the only province in canada without a provincial sales tax
alberta residents are subject to the federal sales tax , the goods and services tax of 5
from 2001 to 2016 , alberta was the only canadian province to have a flat tax of 10 of taxable income , which was introduced by premier , ralph klein , as part of the alberta tax advantage , which also included a zero - percent tax on income below a generous personal exemption
in 2016 , under premier rachel notley , while most albertans continued to pay the 10 income tax rate , new tax brackets 12 , 14 , and 15 for those with higher incomes ( 128 , 145 annually or more ) were introduced
albertas personal income tax system maintained a progressive character by continuing to grant residents personal tax exemptions of 18 , 451 , albertas municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments who usually work in co - operation with the provincial government
by 2018 , most albertans continued to pay the 10 income tax rate
according to a march 2015 statistics canada report , the median household income in alberta in 2014 was about 100 , 000 , which is 23 higher than the canadian national average
based on statistic canada reports , low - income albertans , who earn less than 25 , 000 and those in the high - income bracket earning 150 , 000 or more , are the lowest - taxed people in canada
those in the middle income brackets representing those that earn about 25 , 000 to 75 , 000according to a 2018 cbc article , albertans whose annual income is less than 25 , 000 pay the least income tax in canada ; those that earn about 50 , 000 pay more than both ontarians and british columbians
residents of british columbia who earn about 75 , 000 pay 1 , 200 less in provincial taxes than those in alberta
albertans who earn about 100 , 000 , pay less than ontarians but still more than people in alberta taxpayers who earn 250 , 000 a year or more , pay 4 , 000 less in provincial taxes than someone with a similar income in and about 18 , 000 less than in quebec
pay more in provincial taxes than residents in british columbia and ontario
in terms of income tax , alberta is the best province for those with a low income because there is no provincial income tax for those who earn 18 , 915 or less
even with the 2016 progressive tax brackets up to 15 , albertans who have the highest incomes , those with a 150 , 000 annual income or more—about 178 , 000 people in 2015 , pay the least in taxes in canada
— about 1million albertans earned between 25 , 000 and 150 , 000 in 2015
alberta also privatized alcohol distribution
by 2010 , privatization had increased outlets from 304 stores to 1 , 726 ; 1 , 300 jobs to 4 , 000 jobs ; and 3 , 325 products to 16 , 495 products
tax revenue also increased from 400million to 700million
in 2017 / 18 alberta collected about 2billion in education property taxes from municipalities
the value of assessed property in alberta was approximately 727billion in 2011
depending on the property type , property owners may appeal a property assessment to their municipal local assessment review board , composite assessment review board , or the alberta municipal government board
summer brings many festivals to the province of alberta , especially in edmonton
the edmonton fringe festival is the worlds second - largest after the edinburgh festival
both calgary and edmonton host many annual festivals and events , including folk music festivals
the citys heritage days festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups
edmontons churchill square is home to a large number of the festivals , including the large taste of edmonton and the works art design festival throughout the summer months
the city of calgary is also famous for its stampede , dubbed the greatest outdoor show on earth
the stampede is canadas biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions , such as calf roping and bull riding
in line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique alberta western heritage crafts
in 2019 , the then minister of culture and tourism ricardo miranda announced the alberta artist in residence program in conjunction with the provinces first month of the artist the artist is selected each year via a public and competitive process is expected to do community outreach and attend events to promote the arts throughout the province
the award comes with 60 , 000 funding which includes travel and materials costs
on january 31 , 2019 , lauren crazybull named albertas 1st artist in residence
alberta is the first province to launch an artist in residence program in canada
as with any canadian province , the alberta legislature has ( almost ) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education
since 1905 , the legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905 , as well as to create and regulate universities , colleges , technical institutions , and other educational forms and institutions ( public charter schools , private schools , homeschooling )
there are forty - two public school jurisdictions in alberta , and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions
sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a catholic electorate , and one ( st
albert ) has a protestant electorate
in addition , one protestant separate school district , glen avon , survives as a ward of the st
paul education region
the city of lloydminster straddles the albertan / saskatchewan border , and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers both of them operate according to saskatchewan law
for many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing k–12 education
prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as supplementary support for local education
in 1994 , the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards , but not for separate school boards
since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of k–12 education ; the difference is that the provincial government now sets the mill rate , the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government
the relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to support k–12 education provided by school boards
the provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them , according to a formula , to public and separate school jurisdictions and francophone authorities
public and separate school boards , charter schools , and private schools all follow the program of studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education ( alberta education )
homeschool tutors may choose to follow the program of studies or develop their own program of studies
public and separate schools , charter schools , and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by alberta education , they administer provincial achievement tests and diploma examinations set by alberta education , and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by alberta education
the university of alberta , located in edmonton and established in 1908 , is albertas oldest and largest university
the university of calgary , once affiliated with the university of alberta , gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second - largest university in alberta
athabasca university , which focuses on distance learning , and the university of lethbridge are located in athabasca and lethbridge respectively
in early september 2009 , mount royal university became calgarys second public university , and in late september 2009 , a similar move made macewan university edmontons second public university
there are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding , along with two technical institutes , northern alberta institute of technology and southern alberta institute of technology
there are also many private post - secondary institutions , mostly christian universities , bringing the total number of universities to 12
students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions
there was some controversy in 2005 over the rising cost of post - secondary education for students ( as opposed to taxpayers )
in 2005 , premier ralph klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs
alberta provides a publicly funded , fully integrated health system , through alberta health services ( ahs ) —a quasi - independent agency that delivers health care on behalf of the government of albertas ministry of health
the alberta government provides health services for all its residents as set out by the provisions of the canada health act of 1984
alberta became canadas second province ( after saskatchewan ) to adopt a tommy douglas - style program in 1950 , a precursor to the modern medicare system
albertas health care budget was 22billion during the 2018–2019 fiscal year ( approximately 45 of all government spending ) , making it the best - funded health - care system per - capita in canada
notable health , education , research , and resources facilities in alberta , all of which are located within calgary or edmonton
health centres in calgary include
the edmonton clinic complex , completed in 2012 , provides a similar research , education , and care environment as the mayo clinic in the united states
all public health care services funded by the government of alberta are delivered operationally by alberta health services
ahs is the provinces single health authority , established on july 1 , 2008 , which replaced nine regional health authorities
ahs also funds all ground ambulance services in the province , as well as the province - wide shock trauma air rescue service ( stars ) air ambulance service
alberta is well - connected by air , with international airports in both calgary and edmonton
calgary international airport and edmonton international airport are the fourth - and fifth - busiest in canada , respectively
calgarys airport is a hub for westjet airlines and a regional hub for air canada , primarily serving the prairie provinces ( alberta , saskatchewan and manitoba ) for connecting flights to british columbia , eastern canada , fifteen major united states centres , nine european airports , one asian airport and four destinations in mexico and the caribbean
calgary , edmonton , red deer , medicine hat , and lethbridge have substantial public transit systems in addition to buses , calgary and edmonton operate light rail transit ( lrt ) systems edmonton lrt , which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside the cbd , was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in north america , while the calgary c train has one of the highest numbers of daily riders of any lrt system in north america
there are more than of operating mainline railway in alberta
the vast majority of this trackage is owned by the canadian pacific railway ( cp ) and canadian national railway ( cn ) companies , which operate freight transport across the province
additional railfreight service in the province is provided by two shortline railways the battle river railway and forty mile rail
passenger trains include via rails canadian ( toronto–vancouver ) and jasper–prince rupert trains , which use the cn mainline and pass through jasper national park and parallel the yellowhead highway during at least part of their routes
the rocky mountaineer operates two sections one from vancouver to banff over cp tracks , and a section that travels over cn tracks to jasper
north of edmonton , the highway continues to athabasca , then northwesterly along the south shore of lesser slave lake into high prairie , north to peace river , west to fairview and finally south to grande prairie , where it ends at an interchange with highway43
the section of highway2 between calgary and edmonton has been named the queen elizabethii highway to commemorate the visit of the monarch in 2005
highway2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it highway 22 , west of highway2 , known as cowboy trail , and highway21 , east of highway2
highway43 travels northwest into grande prairie and the peace river country
travelling northeast from edmonton , the highway 63 connects to fort mcmurrayand the athabasca oil sands
alberta has two main east–west corridors
the southern corridor , part of the trans - canada highway system , enters the province near medicine hat , runs westward through calgary , and leaves alberta through banff national park
the northern corridor , also part of the trans - canada network and known as the yellowhead highway ( highway16 ) , runs west from lloydminster in eastern alberta , through edmonton and jasper national park into british columbia
one of the most scenic drives is along the icefields parkway , which runs for west of stettler
the highway connects many of the smaller towns in central alberta with calgary and edmonton , as it crosses highway2 just west of red deer
urban stretches of albertas major highways and freeways are often called trails
for example , highway2 , the main north–south highway in the province , is called deerfoot trail as it passes through calgary but becomes calgary trail ( southbound ) and gateway boulevard ( northbound ) as it enters edmonton and then turns into st
albert trail as it leaves edmonton for the city of st
calgary , in particular , has a tradition of calling its largest urban expressways trails and naming many of them after prominent first nations individuals and tribes , such as crowchild trail , deerfoot trail , and stoney trail
actinopterygii ( having raysgrc ) , members of which are known as ray - finned fishes , is a clade ( traditionally class or subclass ) of the bony fishes
the ray - finned fishes are so - called because their fins are webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines ( rays ) , as opposed to the fleshy , lobed fins that characterize the class sarcopterygii ( lobe - finned fish )
these actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements , the radials , which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton ( for example , pelvic and pectoral girdles )
by species count , actinopterygians dominate the vertebrates , and they comprise nearly 99 of the over 30 , 000 species of fish
they are ubiquitous throughout freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams extant species can range in size from paedocypris , at , and the long - bodied oarfish , at
the vast majority of actinopterygii ( 95 ) are teleosts
ray - finned fishes occur in many variant forms the main features of a typical ray - finned fish are shown in the adjacent diagram
the swim bladder is the more derived structure
ray - finned fishes have many different types of scales ; but all teleosts , the most advanced actinopterygians , have leptoid scales
the outer part of these scales fan out with bony ridges while the inner part is crossed with fibrous connective tissue
leptoid scales are thinner and more transparent than other types of scales , and lack the hardened enamel or dentine - like layers found in the scales of many other fish
unlike ganoid scales , which are found in non - teleost actinopterygians , new scales are added in concentric layers as the fish grows
ray - finned and lobe - finned fishes , including tetrapods , possessed lungs used for aerial respiration
only bichirs retain ventrally budding lungs
ray - finned fish vary in size and shape , in their feeding specializations , and in the number and arrangement of their ray - fins
in nearly all ray - finned fish , the sexes are separate , and in most species the females spawn eggs that are fertilized externally , typically with the male inseminating the eggs after they are laid
development then proceeds with a free - swimming larval stage
most families use external rather than internal fertilization
viviparity , ovoviviparity , or some form of parental care for eggs , whether by the male , the female , or both parents is seen in a significant fraction ( 21 ) of the 422 teleost families ; no care is likely the ancestral condition
the oldest case of viviparity in ray - finned fish is found in middle triassic species of viviparity is relatively rare and is found in about 6 of living teleost species ; male care is far more common than female care
there are a few examples of fish that self - fertilise
the mangrove rivulus is an amphibious , simultaneous hermaphrodite , producing both eggs and spawn and having internal fertilisation
this mode of reproduction may be related to the fishs habit of spending long periods out of water in the mangrove forests it inhabits
males are occasionally produced at temperatures below
actinopterygii is divided into the classes cladistia and actinopteri
the latter comprises the subclasses chondrostei and neopterygii
the neopterygii , in turn , is divided into the infraclasses holostei and teleostei
during the mesozoic ( triassic , jurassic , cretaceous ) and cenozoic the teleosts in particular diversified widely
as a result , 96 of living fish species are teleosts ( 40 of all fish species belong to the teleost subgroup acanthomorpha ) , while all other groups of actinopterygians represent depauperate lineages
the cladogram below shows the main clades of living actinopterygians and their evolutionary relationships to other extant groups of fishes and the four - limbed vertebrates ( tetrapods )
the latter include mostly terrestrial species but also groups that became secondarily aquatic ( for example whales and dolphins )
tetrapods evolved from a group of bony fish during the devonian period
approximate divergence dates for the different actinopterygian clades ( in millions of years , mya ) are from near and others , 2012
the polypterids ( bichirs and reedfish ) are the sister lineage of all other actinopterygians , the acipenseriformes ( sturgeons and paddlefishes ) are the sister lineage of neopterygii , and holostei ( bowfin and gars ) are the sister lineage of teleosts
the elopomorpha ( eels and tarpons ) appear to be the most basal teleosts
the earliest known fossil actinopterygian is andreolepis hedei , dating back 420million years ( late silurian )
remains have been found in russia , sweden , and estonia
although it is suspected that teleosts originated already during the paleozoic era
the listing below is a summary of all extinct ( indicated by a dagger , † ) and living groups of actinopterygii with their respcective taxonomic rank
the taxonomy follows phylogenetic classification of bony fishes and fishbase and xu 2021
albert einstein ( ; , which arises from relativity theory , has been dubbed the worlds most famous equation
his work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science
he received the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect , a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory
his intellectual achievements and originality resulted in einstein becoming synonymous with genius
in 1905 , a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ( miracle year ) , einstein published four groundbreaking papers
these outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect , explained brownian motion , introduced special relativity , and demonstrated mass - energy equivalence
einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field , which led him to develop his special theory of relativity
he then extended the theory to gravitational fields ; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 , introducing his theory of gravitation
in 1917 , he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe
he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory , which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules
he also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation , which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light
however , for much of the later part of his career , he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors
first , despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics , he opposed what it evolved into , objecting that nature does not play dice
second , he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism
as a result , he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics
einstein was born in the german empire , but moved to switzerland in 1895 , forsaking his german citizenship ( as a subject of the kingdom of württemberg ) the following year
in 1897 , at the age of 17 , he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the swiss federal polytechnic school in zürich , graduating in 1900
in 1901 , he acquired swiss citizenship , which he kept for the rest of his life , and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the swiss patent office in bern
in 1905 , he was awarded a phd by the university of zurich
in 1914 , einstein moved to berlin in order to join the prussian academy of sciences and the humboldt university of berlin
in 1917 , einstein became director of the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics ; he also became a german citizen again , this time prussian
in 1933 , while einstein was visiting the united states , adolf hitler came to power in germany
einstein , of jewish origin , objected to the policies of the newly elected nazi government ; he settled in the united states and became an american citizen in 1940
on the eve of world war ii , he endorsed a letter to president franklin roosevelt alerting him to the potential german nuclear weapons program and recommending that the us begin similar research
einstein supported the allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons
albert einstein was born in ulm , in the kingdom of württemberg in the german empire , on 14 march 1879 into a family of secular ashkenazi jews
his parents were hermann einstein , a salesman and engineer , and pauline koch
in 1880 , the family moved to munich , where einsteins father and his uncle jakob founded elektrotechnische fabrik einstein cie , a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current
albert attended a catholic elementary school in munich , from the age of five , for three years
at the age of eight , he was transferred to the luitpold - gymnasium ( now known as the albert - einstein - gymnasium ) , where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the german empire seven years later
in 1894 , hermann and jakobs company lost a bid to supply the city of munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current ( dc ) standard to the more efficient alternating current ( ac ) standard
the loss forced the sale of the munich factory
in search of business , the einstein family moved to italy , first to milan and a few months later to pavia
when the family moved to pavia , einstein , then 15 , stayed in munich to finish his studies at the luitpold gymnasium
his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering , but einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the schools regimen and teaching method
he later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning
at the end of december 1894 , he traveled to italy to join his family in pavia , convincing the school to let him go by using a doctors note
einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age , reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers
the 12 - year - old einstein taught himself algebra and euclidean geometry over a single summer
einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the pythagorean theorem at age 12
a family tutor max talmud says that after he had given the 12 - year - old einstein a geometry textbook , after a short time einstein had worked through the whole book
he thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high i could not follow
einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12 , and as a 14 - year - old he says he had mastered integral and differential calculus
in 1895 , at the age of 16 , einstein took the entrance examinations for the swiss federal polytechnic school in zürich ( later the eidgenössische technische hochschule , eth )
he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination , on the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school , he attended the argovian cantonal school ( gymnasium ) in aarau , switzerland , in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling
while lodging with the family of jost winteler , he fell in love with wintelers daughter , marie
alberts sister maja later married wintelers son paul
in september 1896 he passed the swiss matura with mostly good grades , including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects , on a scale of 1–6
einsteins future wife , a 20 - year - old serbian named mileva marić , also enrolled at the polytechnic school that year
she was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course
over the next few years , einsteins and marićs friendship developed into a romance , and they spent countless hours debating and reading books together on extra - curricular physics in which they were both interested
einstein wrote in his letters to marić that he preferred studying alongside her
there is eyewitness evidence and several letters over many years that indicate marić might have collaborated with einstein prior to his landmark 1905 papers , known as the annus mirabilis papers , and that they developed some of the concepts together during their studies , although some historians of physics who have studied the issue disagree that she made any substantive contributions
early correspondence between einstein and marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named lieserl , born in early 1902 in novi sad where marić was staying with her parents
marić returned to switzerland without the child , whose real name and fate are unknown
the contents of einsteins letter in september 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy
einstein and marić married in january 1903
in may 1904 , their son hans albert einstein was born in bern , switzerland
their son eduard was born in zürich in july 1910
the couple moved to berlin in april 1914 , but marić returned to zürich with their sons after learning that , despite their close relationship before , einsteins chief romantic attraction was now his cousin elsa löwenthal ; einstein and marić divorced on 14 february 1919 , having lived apart for five years
in letters revealed in 2015 , einstein wrote to his early love marie winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her
he wrote in 1910 , while his wife was pregnant with their second child i think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be
he spoke about a misguided love and a missed life regarding his love for marie
in 1923 , einstein fell in love with a secretary named betty neumann , the niece of a close friend , hans mühsam
einstein described about six women , including margarete lebach ( a blonde austrian ) , estella katzenellenbogen ( the rich owner of a florist business ) , toni mendel ( a wealthy jewish widow ) and ethel michanowski ( a berlin socialite ) , with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to elsa
later , after the death of his second wife elsa , einstein was briefly in a relationship with margarita konenkova
einsteins son eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia
his mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods , finally , after her death , being committed permanently to burghölzli , the psychiatric university hospital in zürich
after graduating in 1900 , einstein spent almost two years searching for a teaching post
he acquired swiss citizenship in february 1901 , as an assistant examiner – level iii
einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter
in 1903 , his position at the swiss patent office became permanent , although he was passed over for promotion until he fully mastered machine technology
much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical - mechanical synchronization of time , two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time
with a few friends he had met in bern , einstein started a small discussion group in 1902 , self - mockingly named the olympia academy , which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy
sometimes they were joined by mileva who attentively listened but did not participate
in 1900 einsteins paper folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen ( conclusions from the capillarity phenomena ) was published in the journal annalen der physik
with alfred kleiner , serving as pro - forma advisor
his thesis was accepted in july 1905 , and einstein was awarded a phd on january 15 , 1906
also in 1905 , which has been called einsteins annus mirabilis ( amazing year ) , he published four groundbreaking papers , on the photoelectric effect , brownian motion , special relativity , and the equivalence of mass and energy , which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world , at the age of 26
by 1908 , he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the university of bern
the following year , after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the university of zurich , alfred kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics
einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909
einstein became a full professor at the german charles - ferdinand university in prague in april 1911 , accepting austrian citizenship in the austro - hungarian empire to do so
during his prague stay , he wrote 11 scientific works , five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids
in july 1912 , he returned to his alma mater in zürich
from 1912 until 1914 , he was a professor of theoretical physics at the eth zurich , where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics
he also studied continuum mechanics , the molecular theory of heat , and the problem of gravitation , on which he worked with mathematician and friend marcel grossmann
when the manifesto of the ninety - three was published in october 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent german intellectuals that justified germanys militarism and position during the first world war—einstein was one of the few german intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic manifesto to the europeans
in the spring of 1913 , einstein was enticed to move to berlin with an offer that included membership in the prussian academy of sciences , and a linked university of berlin professorship , enabling him to concentrate exclusively on research
on 3 july 1913 , he became a member of the prussian academy of sciences in berlin
max planck and walther nernst visited him the next week in zurich to persuade him to join the academy , additionally offering him the post of director at the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics , which was soon to be established
after moving into his dahlem apartment on 1 april 1914
in 1911 , einstein used his 1907 equivalence principle to calculate the deflection of light from another star by the suns gravity
in 1913 , einstein improved upon those calculations by using riemannian space - time to represent the gravity field
by the fall of 1915 , einstein had successfully completed his general theory of relativity , which he used to calculate that deflection , and the perihelion precession of mercury
in 1919 , that deflection prediction was confirmed by sir arthur eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 may 1919
those observations were published in the international media , making einstein world - famous
on 7 november 1919 , the leading british newspaper the times printed a banner headline that read revolution in science– new theory of the universe– newtonian ideas overthrown
in 1920 , he became a foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences
in 1922 , he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect
while the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial , the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law , as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the planck spectrum by bose
einstein was elected a foreign member of the royal society ( formemrs ) in 1921
he also received the copley medal from the royal society in 1925
einstein resigned from the prussian academy in march 1933
einsteins scientific accomplishments while in berlin , included finishing the general theory of relativity , proving the gyromagnetic effect , contributing to the quantum theory of radiation , and bose–einstein statistics
einstein visited new york city for the first time on 2 april 1921 , where he received an official welcome by mayor john francis hylan , followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions

com / history / one - hundred - years - ago - einstein - was - given - heros - welcome - americas - jews - 180977386 / one hundred years ago , einstein was given a heros welcome by americas jews
he also published an essay , my first impression of the , in july 1921 , in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of americans , much as had alexis de tocqueville , who published his own impressions in democracy in america ( 1835 )
for some of his observations , einstein was clearly surprised what strikes a visitor is the joyous , positive attitude to life the american is friendly , self - confident , optimistic , and without envy
in 1922 , his travels took him to asia and later to palestine , as part of a six - month excursion and speaking tour , as he visited singapore , ceylon and japan , where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of japanese
after his first public lecture , he met the emperor and empress at the imperial palace , where thousands came to watch
in a letter to his sons , he described his impression of the japanese as being modest , intelligent , considerate , and having a true feel for art
because of einsteins travels to the far east , he was unable to personally accept the nobel prize for physics at the stockholm award ceremony in december 1922
in his place , the banquet speech was made by a german diplomat , who praised einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist
on his return voyage , he visited palestine for 12 days , his only visit to that region
he was greeted as if he were a head of state , rather than a physicist , which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the british high commissioner , sir herbert samuel
during one reception , the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him
in einsteins talk to the audience , he expressed happiness that the jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world
einstein visited spain for two weeks in 1923 , where he briefly met santiago ramón y cajal and also received a diploma from king alfonso xiii naming him a member of the spanish academy of sciences
from 1922 to 1932 , einstein was a member of the international committee on intellectual cooperation of the league of nations in geneva ( with a few months of interruption in 1923–1924 ) , a body created to promote international exchange between scientists , researchers , teachers , artists , and intellectuals
originally slated to serve as the swiss delegate , secretary - general eric drummond was persuaded by catholic activists oskar halecki and giuseppe motta to instead have him become the german delegate , thus allowing gonzague de reynold to take the swiss spot , from which he promoted traditionalist catholic values
einsteins former physics professor hendrik lorentz and the polish chemist marie curie were also members of the committee
in the months of march and april 1925 , einstein visited south america , where he spent about a month in argentina , a week in uruguay , and a week in rio de janeiro , brazil
with the support of several argentine scholars , including julio rey pastor , jakob laub , and leopoldo lugones
the visit by einstein and his wife was financed primarily by the council of the university of buenos aires and the asociación hebraica argentina ( argentine hebraic association ) with a smaller contribution from the argentine - germanic cultural institution
in december 1930 , einstein visited america for the second time , originally intended as a two - month working visit as a research fellow at the california institute of technology
after the national attention , he received during his first trip to the us , he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy
although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly , he declined them all
after arriving in new york city , einstein was taken to various places and events , including chinatown , a lunch with the editors of the new york times , and a performance of carmen at the metropolitan opera , where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival
during the days following , he was given the keys to the city by mayor jimmy walker and met the president of columbia university , who described einstein as the ruling monarch of the mind
also during his stay in new york , he joined a crowd of 15 , 000 people at madison square garden during a hanukkah celebration
einstein next traveled to california , where he met caltech president and nobel laureate robert millikan
his friendship with millikan was awkward , as millikan had a penchant for patriotic militarism , where einstein was a pronounced pacifist
this aversion to war also led einstein to befriend author upton sinclair and film star charlie chaplin , both noted for their pacifism
carl laemmle , head of universal studios , gave einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to chaplin
they had an instant rapport , with chaplin inviting einstein and his wife , elsa , to his home for dinner
chaplin said einsteins outward persona , calm and gentle , seemed to conceal a highly emotional temperament , from which came his extraordinary intellectual energy
chaplins film , city lights , was to premiere a few days later in hollywood , and chaplin invited einstein and elsa to join him as his special guests
walter isaacson , einsteins biographer , described this as one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity
in february 1933 , while on a visit to the united states , einstein knew he could not return to germany with the rise to power of the nazis under germanys new chancellor , adolf hitler
while at american universities in early 1933 , he undertook his third two - month visiting professorship at the california institute of technology in pasadena
in february and march 1933 , the gestapo repeatedly raided his familys apartment in berlin
the nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a hitler youth camp
in april 1933 , einstein discovered that the new german government had passed laws barring jews from holding any official positions , including teaching at universities
a month later , einsteins works were among those targeted by the german student union in the nazi book burnings , with nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaiming , jewish intellectualism is dead
in a subsequent letter to physicist and friend max born , who had already emigrated from germany to england , einstein wrote , i must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise
einstein was now without a permanent home , unsure where he would live and work , and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in germany
he rented a house in de haan , belgium , where he lived for a few months
in late july 1933 , he went to england for about six weeks at the personal invitation of british naval officer commander oliver locker - lampson , who had become friends with einstein in the preceding years
locker - lampson invited him to stay near his
to protect einstein , locker - lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin ; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding einstein was published in the daily herald on 24 july 1933
locker - lampson took einstein to meet winston churchill at his home , and later , austen chamberlain and former prime minister lloyd george
einstein asked them to help bring jewish scientists out of germany
british historian martin gilbert notes that churchill responded immediately , and sent his friend , physicist frederick lindemann , to germany to seek out jewish scientists and place them in british universities
churchill later observed that as a result of germany having driven the jews out , they had lowered their technical standards and put the allies technology ahead of theirs
einstein later contacted leaders of other nations , including turkeys prime minister , i̇smet i̇nönü , to whom he wrote in september 1933 requesting placement of unemployed german - jewish scientists
as a result of einsteins letter , jewish invitees to turkey eventually totaled over 1 , 000 saved individuals
locker - lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend british citizenship to einstein , during which period einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in europe
in october 1933 , einstein returned to the us and took up a position at the institute for advanced study , noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing nazi germany
at the time , most american universities , including harvard , princeton and yale , had minimal or no jewish faculty or students , as a result of their jewish quotas , which lasted until the late 1940s
einstein was still undecided on his future
he had offers from several european universities , including christ church , oxford , where he stayed for three short periods between may 1931 and june 1933 and was offered a five - year studentship , but in 1935 , he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the united states and apply for citizenship
einsteins affiliation with the institute for advanced study would last until his death in 1955
he was one of the four first selected ( along with john von neumann and kurt gödel ) at the new institute , where he soon developed a close friendship with gödel
the two would take long walks together discussing their work
bruria kaufman , his assistant , later became a physicist
during this period , einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics , both unsuccessfully
in 1939 , a group of hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist leó szilárd attempted to alert washington to ongoing nazi atomic bomb research
the groups warnings were discounted
einstein and szilárd , along with other refugees such as edward teller and eugene wigner , regarded it as their responsibility to alert americans to the possibility that german scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb , and to warn that hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon
to make certain the us was aware of the danger , in july 1939 , a few months before the beginning of world war ii in europe , szilárd and wigner visited einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs , which einstein , a pacifist , said he had never considered
he was asked to lend his support by writing a letter , with szilárd , to president roosevelt , recommending the us pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research
the letter is believed to be arguably the key stimulus for the adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the entry into world war ii
in addition to the letter , einstein used his connections with the belgian royal family and the belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the white houses oval office
some say that as a result of einsteins letter and his meetings with roosevelt , the us entered the race to develop the bomb , drawing on its immense material , financial , and scientific resources to initiate the manhattan project
for einstein , war was a disease and he called for resistance to war
by signing the letter to roosevelt , some argue he went against his pacifist principles
in 1954 , a year before his death , einstein said to his old friend , linus pauling , i made one great mistake in my life—when i signed the letter to president roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made ; but there was some justification—the danger that the germans would make them in 1955 , einstein and ten other intellectuals and scientists , including british philosopher bertrand russell , signed a manifesto highlighting the danger of nuclear weapons
einstein became an american citizen in 1940
not long after settling into his career at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in american culture when compared to europe
he recognized the right of individuals to say and think what they pleased , without social barriers , and as a result , individuals were encouraged , he said , to be more creative , a trait he valued from his own early education
einstein joined the national association for the advancement of colored people ( naacp ) in princeton , where he campaigned for the civil rights of african americans
he considered racism americas worst disease , as part of his involvement , he corresponded with civil rights activist du bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951
when einstein offered to be a character witness for du bois , the judge decided to drop the case
in 1946 , einstein visited lincoln university in pennsylvania , a historically black college , where he was awarded an honorary degree
lincoln was the first university in the united states to grant college degrees to african americans ; alumni include langston hughes and thurgood marshall
einstein gave a speech about racism in america , adding , i do not intend to be quiet about it
a resident of princeton recalls that einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student
einstein has said being a jew myself , perhaps i can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination
einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the hebrew university of jerusalem , he also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs
among those , he advised first creating an institute of agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land
that should be followed , he suggested , by a chemical institute and an institute of microbiology , to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria , which he called an evil that was undermining a third of the countrys development
einstein was not a nationalist ; he was against the creation of an independent jewish state , which would be established without his help as israel in 1948
einstein felt that the waves of arriving jews of the aliyah could live alongside existing arabs in palestine
his views were not shared by the majority of jews seeking to form a new country ; as a result , einstein was limited to a marginal role in the zionist movement
chaim weizmann later became israels first president
upon his death while in office in november 1952 and at the urging of ezriel carlebach , prime minister david ben - gurion offered einstein the position of president of israel , a mostly ceremonial post
the offer was presented by israels ambassador in washington , abba eban , who explained that the offer embodies the deepest respect which the jewish people can repose in any of its sons
einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age
in his late journals he wrote if i were not a physicist , i would probably be a musician
i often think in music
i live my daydreams in music
i see my life in terms of music i get most joy in life out of music
his mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin , not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into german culture
according to conductor leon botstein , einstein began playing when he was 5
however , he did not enjoy it at that age
when he turned 13 , he discovered the violin sonatas of mozart , whereupon he became enamored of mozarts compositions and studied music more willingly
einstein taught himself to play without ever practicing systematically
he said that love is a better teacher than a sense of duty
at age 17 , he was heard by a school examiner in aarau while playing beethovens violin sonatas
the examiner stated afterward that his playing was remarkable and revealing of great insight
what struck the examiner , writes botstein , was that einstein displayed a deep love of the music , a quality that was and remains in short supply
music possessed an unusual meaning for this student
music took on a pivotal and permanent role in einsteins life from that period on
although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time , among those with whom einstein played chamber music were a few professionals , including kurt appelbaum , and he performed for private audiences and friends
chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in bern , zürich , and berlin , where he played with max planck and his son , among others
he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the köchel catalog of mozarts work ; that edition was prepared by alfred einstein , who may have been a distant relation
in 1931 , while engaged in research at the california institute of technology , he visited the zoellner family conservatory in los angeles , where he played some of beethoven and mozarts works with members of the zoellner quartet
near the end of his life , when the young juilliard quartet visited him in princeton , he played his violin with them , and the quartet was impressed by einsteins level of coordination and intonation
in 1918 , einstein was one of the founding members of the german democratic party , a liberal party
his opinions on the bolsheviks also changed with time
in 1925 , he criticized them for not having a well - regulated system of government and called their rule a regime of terror and a tragedy in human history
he later adopted a more moderated view , criticizing their methods but praising them , which is shown by his 1929 remark on vladimir lenin in lenin i honor a man , who in total sacrifice of his own person has committed his entire energy to realizing social justice
i do not find his methods advisable
one thing is certain , however men like him are the guardians and renewers of mankinds conscience
he strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation - states in the framework of a world federation
he wrote i advocate world government because i am convinced that there is no other possible way of eliminating the most terrible danger in which man has ever found himself
the fbi created a secret dossier on einstein in 1932 , and by the time of his death his fbi file was 1 , 427 pages long
einstein was deeply impressed by mahatma gandhi , with whom he exchanged written letters
he described gandhi as a role model for the generations to come
the initial connection was established on 27 september 1931 , when wilfrid israel took his indian guest sundaram to meet his friend einstein at his summer home in the town of caputh
sundaram was gandhis disciple and special envoy , whom wilfrid israel met while visiting india and visiting the indian leaders home in 1925
during the visit , einstein wrote a short letter to gandhi that was delivered to him through his envoy , and gandhi responded quickly with his own letter
although in the end einstein and gandhi were unable to meet as they had hoped , the direct connection between them was established through wilfrid israel
einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews
he said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic god of baruch spinozas philosophy
he clarified , however , that i am not an atheist , or a deeply religious nonbeliever
einstein was primarily affiliated with non - religious humanist and ethical culture groups in both the uk and us
he served on the advisory board of the first humanist society of new york , and was an honorary associate of the rationalist association , which publishes new humanist in britain
for the 75th anniversary of the new york society for ethical culture , he stated that the idea of ethical culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism
he observed , without ethical culture there is no salvation for humanity
in a german - language letter to philosopher eric gutkind , dated 3 january 1954 , einstein wrotethe word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses , the bible a collection of honorable , but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish
no interpretation no matter how subtle can ( for me ) change this
for me the jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions
and the jewish people to whom i gladly belong and with whose mentality i have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people
i cannot see anything chosen about them
on 17 april 1955 , einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm , which had previously been reinforced surgically by rudolph nissen in 1948
he took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of israels seventh anniversary with him to the hospital , but he did not live to complete it
einstein refused surgery , saying , i want to go when i want
it is tasteless to prolong life artificially
i have done my share ; it is time to go
i will do it elegantly
he died in the university medical center of princeton at plainsboro early the next morning at the age of 76 , having continued to work until near the end
during the autopsy , the pathologist thomas stoltz harvey removed einsteins brain for preservation without the permission of his family , in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent
einsteins remains were cremated in trenton , new jersey , and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location
in a memorial lecture delivered on 13 december 1965 at unesco headquarters , nuclear physicist robert oppenheimer summarized his impression of einstein as a person he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness there was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn
einstein bequeathed his personal archives , library , and intellectual assets to the hebrew university of jerusalem in israel
throughout his life , einstein published hundreds of books and articles
he published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non - scientific ones
on 5 december 2014 , universities and archives announced the release of einsteins papers , comprising more than 30 , 000 unique documents
einsteins intellectual achievements and originality have made the word einstein synonymous with genius
in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the bose–einstein statistics , the einstein refrigerator and others
the annus mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect ( which gave rise to quantum theory ) , brownian motion , the special theory of relativity , and e mc2 that einstein published in the annalen der physik scientific journal in 1905
these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space , time , and matter
the four papers are
einsteins first paper submitted in 1900 to annalen der physik was on capillary attraction
it was published in 1901 with the title folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen , which translates as conclusions from the capillarity phenomena
two papers he published in 1902–1903 ( thermodynamics ) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view
these papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on brownian motion , which showed that brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist
his research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena
einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations , giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point
ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density
at the critical point , this derivative is zero , leading to large fluctuations
the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered , making the fluid look milky white
einstein relates this to rayleigh scattering , which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength , and which explains why the sky is blue
einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter
einsteins zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper observationally , the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds ( where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light )
the theory developed in this paper later became known as einsteins special theory of relativity
there is evidence from einsteins writings that he collaborated with his first wife , mileva marić , on this work
the decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual , but the exact reason is unknown
this paper predicted that , when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer , a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down , and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion
this paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous
in his paper on mass–energy equivalence , einstein produced emc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations
einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics ( the study of moving bodies )
in 1908 , hermann minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime
einstein adopted minkowskis formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity
general relativity ( gr ) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by einstein between 1907 and 1915
according to general relativity , the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses
general relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics
it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes , regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape
as einstein later said , the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory , while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion ( even accelerated ones ) should appear more satisfactory
in 1911 , einstein published another article on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of light expanding on the 1907 article , in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies
thus , the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally
in 1916 , einstein predicted gravitational waves , ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves , traveling outward from the source , transporting energy as gravitational radiation
the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it
by contrast , gravitational waves cannot exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation , which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed
the first , indirect , detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars , psr b191316
the explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves
einsteins prediction was confirmed on 11 february 2016 , when researchers at ligo published the first observation of gravitational waves , detected on earth on 14 september 2015 , nearly one hundred years after the prediction
while developing general relativity , einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory
he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible
he gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only
in june 1913 , the entwurf ( draft ) theory was the result of these investigations
as its name suggests , it was a sketch of a theory , less elegant and more difficult than general relativity , with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions
after more than two years of intensive work , einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in november 1915
in 1917 , einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole
following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by edwin hubble in 1929 , einstein abandoned his static model of the universe , and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos , the friedmann - einstein universe of 1931 in each of these models , einstein discarded the cosmological constant , claiming that it was in any case theoretically unsatisfactory
in many einstein biographies , it is claimed that einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his biggest blunder
the astrophysicist mario livio has recently cast doubt on this claim , suggesting that it may be exaggerated
in late 2013 , a team led by the irish physicist cormac oraifeartaigh discovered evidence that , shortly after learning of hubbles observations of the recession of the nebulae , einstein considered a steady - state model of the universe
in a hitherto overlooked manuscript , apparently written in early 1931 , einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter , a process he associated with the cosmological constant
as he stated in the paper , in what follows , i would like to draw attention to a solution to equation ( 1 ) that can account for hubbels sic facts , and in which the density is constant over time if one considers a physically bounded volume , particles of matter will be continually leaving it
for the density to remain constant , new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space
it thus appears that einstein considered a steady - state model of the expanding universe many years before hoyle , bondi and gold
however , einsteins steady - state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea
general relativity includes a dynamical spacetime , so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum
noethers theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a lagrangian with translation invariance , but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry
the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by noethers prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason
einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates
he maintained that the non - covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was , in fact , the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field
this approach has been echoed by lev landau and evgeny lifshitz , and others , and has become standard
the use of non - covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by erwin schrödinger and others
in 1935 , einstein collaborated with nathan rosen to produce a model of a wormhole , often called einstein–rosen bridges
his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations , in line with the program outlined in the paper do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles
these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches
if one end of a wormhole was positively charged , the other end would be negatively charged
these properties led einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way
the theory of general relativity has a fundamental lawthe einstein field equations , which describe how space curves
the geodesic equation , which describes how particles move , may be derived from the einstein field equations
since the equations of general relativity are non - linear , a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields , like a black hole , would move on a trajectory which is determined by the einstein field equations themselves , not by a new law
so einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution , like a black hole , would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself
this was established by einstein , infeld , and hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum , and by roy kerr for spinning objects
in a 1905 paper , einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles ( quanta )
einsteins light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists , including max planck and niels bohr
this idea only became universally accepted in 1919 , with robert millikans detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect , and with the measurement of compton scattering
einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each , where h is plancks constant
he does not say much more , because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave
but he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results , notably the photoelectric effect
in 1907 , einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator
in the einstein model , each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator
einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult , but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics
peter debye refined this model
throughout the 1910s , quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems after ernest rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets , niels bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by planck and developed by einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms , and the periodic table of the elements
einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments wilhelm wien had made
wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process
einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant
arnold sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics
in 1924 , einstein received a description of a statistical model from indian physicist satyendra nath bose , based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles
einstein noted that boses statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles , and submitted his translation of boses paper to the zeitschrift für physik
einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications , among them the bose–einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures
it was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by eric allin cornell and carl wieman using ultra - cooling equipment built at the nist–jila laboratory at the university of colorado at boulder
bose–einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons
einsteins sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university
although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in 1906 , he had not given up on academia
in 1908 , he became a privatdozent at the university of bern
in über die entwicklung unserer anschauungen über das wesen und die konstitution der strahlung ( the development of our views on the composition and essence of radiation ) , on the quantization of light , and in an earlier 1909 paper , einstein showed that max plancks energy quanta must have well - defined momenta and act in some respects as independent , point - like particles
this paper introduced the photon concept ( although the name photon was introduced later by gilbert lewis in 1926 ) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics
einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new , unified foundation
in a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913 , planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero - point energy in his second quantum theory
soon , this idea attracted the attention of einstein and his assistant otto stern
assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero - point energy , they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data
the numbers matched nicely
however , after publishing the findings , they promptly withdrew their support , because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero - point energy
in 1917 , at the height of his work on relativity , einstein published an article in physikalische zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission , the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser
this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with plancks distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode
this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics , because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws
einstein discovered louis de broglies work and supported his ideas , which were received skeptically at first
in another major paper from this era , einstein gave a wave equation for de broglie waves , which einstein suggested was the hamilton–jacobi equation of mechanics
this paper would inspire schrödingers work of 1926
einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory , beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect
however , he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925 , despite its acceptance by other physicists
he was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism , stating that god is not playing at dice
until the end of his life , he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete
in 1935 , einstein returned to quantum mechanics , in particular to the question of its completeness , in a collaboration with boris podolsky and nathan rosen that laid out what would become known as the epr paradox
given einsteins concept of local realism , there were two possibilities ( 1 ) either the other particle had these properties already determined , or ( 2 ) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle
einstein rejected this second possibility ( popularly called spooky action at a distance )
einsteins belief in local realism led him to assert that , while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question , it must be incomplete
but as a physical principle , local realism was shown to be incorrect when the aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed bells theorem , which bell had delineated in 1964
the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical - like entities , each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated
although einstein was wrong about local realism , his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite , entangled quantum states , has resulted in the epr paper becoming among the most influential papers published in physical review
it is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory
following his research on general relativity , einstein attempted to generalize his theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity
in 1950 , he described his unified field theory in a scientific american article titled on the generalized theory of gravitation
although he was lauded for this work , his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful
notably , einsteins unification project did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces , neither of which were well understood until many years after his death
although mainstream physics long ignored einsteins approaches to unification , einsteins work has motivated modern quests for a theory of everything , in particular string theory , where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum - mechanical setting
einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned
these pertain to force , superconductivity , and other research
in addition to longtime collaborators leopold infeld , nathan rosen , peter bergmann and others , einstein also had some one - shot collaborations with various scientists
einstein and de haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons , nowadays known to be the spin
in order to show this , they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum
they confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate , because the electrons angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes
this experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small , but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization
einstein suggested to erwin schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a bose–einstein gas by considering a box
then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator
quantizing these oscillators , each level will have an integer occupation number , which will be the number of particles in it
this formulation is a form of second quantization , but it predates modern quantum mechanics
erwin schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas
schrödinger urged einstein to add his name as co - author , although einstein declined the invitation
in 1926 , einstein and his former student leó szilárd co - invented ( and in 1930 , patented ) the einstein refrigerator
this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input
on 11 november 1930 ,
while traveling , einstein wrote daily to his wife elsa and adopted stepdaughters margot and ilse
the letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the hebrew university of jerusalem
margot einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public , but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death ( she died in 1986 )
barbara wolff , of the hebrew universitys albert einstein archives , told the bbc that there are about 3 , 500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955
einsteins right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in california
although the court initially held that the right had expired , that ruling was immediately appealed , and the decision was later vacated in its entirety
the underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled
the right is enforceable , and the hebrew university of jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right
corbis , successor to the roger richman agency , licenses the use of his name and associated imagery , as agent for the university
einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities , beginning with the confirmation of his theory of general relativity in 1919
despite the general public having little understanding of his work , he was widely recognized and received adulation and publicity
in the period before world war ii , the new yorker published a vignette in their the talk of the town feature saying that einstein was so well known in america that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain that theory
he finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries
he told his inquirers pardon me , sorry always i am mistaken for professor einstein
einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels , films , plays , and works of music
he is a favorite model for depictions of absent - minded professors ; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated
time magazines frederic golden wrote that einstein was a cartoonists dream come true
einstein received numerous awards and honors , and in 1922 , he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect
none of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by alfred nobel , so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to einstein in 1922

afghanistan , officially the islamic emirate of afghanistan , it is bordered by pakistan to the east and south , iran to the west , turkmenistan to the northwest , uzbekistan to the north , tajikistan to the northeast , and china to the northeast and east
occupying , its population is 40 million , composed mostly of ethnic pashtuns , tajiks , hazaras , and uzbeks
kabul is the countrys largest city and serves as its capital
human habitation in afghanistan dates back to the middle paleolithic era , and the countrys strategic location along the historic silk road has led it to being described , picturesquely , as the ‘roundabout of the ancient world’
the land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by alexander the great , the maurya empire , arab muslims , the mongols , the british , the soviet union , and most recently by an american - led coalition
afghanistan also served as the source from which the greco - bactrians and the mughals , among others , rose to form major empires
the modern state of afghanistan began with the durrani dynasty in the 18th century , with the durrani afghan empire being formed by ahmad shah durrani
the durrani empire led conquests in which , at its peak , encompassed land that spanned from eastern iran to northern india
following its decline and the death of ahmad shah durrani , and timur shah , it was divided into multiple smaller independent kingdoms , including but not limited to herat , kandahar and kabul
afghanistan would be reunited in the 19th century after wars of unification led by dost mohammad khan , where he conquered the independent principalities in afghanistan
dost mohammad died in 1863 , weeks after his last campaign to unite afghanistan , and as a result , threw afghanistan back into civil war with his successors
during this time , afghanistan became a buffer state in the great game between the british empire ( in british - ruled india ) and the russian empire ; from india , the british attempted to subjugate afghanistan but were repelled in the first anglo - afghan war ; however , the second anglo - afghan war saw a british victory and the successful establishment of british political influence over afghanistan
following the third anglo - afghan war in 1919 , afghanistan became free of foreign dominance , and eventually emerged as the independent kingdom of afghanistan in june 1926 under amanullah khan
this monarchy lasted almost 50 years , until zahir shah was overthrown in 1973 , following which the republic of afghanistan was established
since the late 1970s , afghanistans history has been dominated by extensive warfare , including coups , revolutions , invasions , insurgencies , and civil wars
the country is currently under the control of the taliban , an islamist political movement that returned to power in 2021 after a 20 - year - long war with the united states and its allies
due to the effects of war , the country has dealt with high levels of terrorism , poverty , and child malnutrition
afghanistans economy is the worlds 96th - largest , with a gross domestic product ( gdp ) of 72 billion by purchasing power parity ; the country fares much worse in terms of per - capita gdp ( ppp ) , ranking 169th out of 186 countries
afghanistan is prominently rich in natural resources
those resources include lithium , iron , zinc , and copper , amongst many others
it is also the largest producer of opium
the country is a founding member of the united nations , the organisation of islamic cooperation , and the world trade organisation
the root name afghān is , according to some scholars , derived from the sanskrit name of the aśvakan or assakan , ancient inhabitants of the hindu kush region
historically , the ethnonym afghān was used to refer to ethnic pashtuns
the last part of the name , - stan is a persian suffix for place of
therefore , afghanistan translates to land of the afghans , or land of the pashtuns in a historical sense
according to the third edition of the encyclopedia of islam
many empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in afghanistan , such as the greco - bactrians , indo - scythians , kushans , kidarites , hephthalites , alkhons , nezaks , zunbils , turk shahis , hindu shahis , lawiks , saffarids , samanids , ghaznavids , ghurids , khaljis , kartids , lodis , surs , mughals , and finally , the hotak and durrani dynasties , which marked the political origins of the modern state
throughout millennia several cities within the modern day afghanistan served as capitals of various empires , namely , bactra ( balkh ) , alexandria on the oxus ( ai - khanoum ) , kapisi , sigal , kabul , kunduz , zaranj , firozkoh , herat , ghazna ( ghazni ) , binban ( bamyan ) , and kandahar
the country has been home to various peoples through the ages , among them the ancient iranian peoples who established the dominant role of indo - iranian languages in the region
at multiple points , the land has been incorporated within vast regional empires ; among them the achaemenid empire , the macedonian empire , the maurya empire , and the islamic empire
excavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now afghanistan at least 50 , 000 years ago , and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world
an important site of early historical activities , many believe that afghanistan compares to egypt in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites
archaeological exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east , west , and north
artifacts typical of the paleolithic , mesolithic , neolithic , bronze , and iron ages have been found in afghanistan
urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 bce , and the early city of mundigak ( near kandahar in the south of the country ) was a center of the helmand culture
more recent findings established that the indus valley civilization stretched up towards modern - day afghanistan , making the ancient civilization today part of pakistan , afghanistan , and india
in more detail , it extended from what today is northwest pakistan to northwest india and northeast afghanistan
an indus valley site has been found on the oxus river at shortugai in northern afghanistan
after 2000 bce , successive waves of semi - nomadic people from central asia began moving south into afghanistan ; among them were many indo - european - speaking indo - iranians
these tribes later migrated further into south asia , western asia , and toward europe via the area north of the caspian sea
the region at the time was referred to as ariana
by the middle of the 6th century bce , the achaemenids overthrew the medes and incorporated arachosia , aria , and bactria within its eastern boundaries
an inscription on the tombstone of darius i of persia mentions the kabul valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered
alexander the great and his macedonian forces arrived in afghanistan in 330 bce after defeating darius iii of persia a year earlier in the battle of gaugamela
following alexanders brief occupation , the successor state of the seleucid empire controlled the region until 305 bce when they gave much of it to the maurya empire as part of an alliance treaty
the mauryans controlled the area south of the hindu kush until they were overthrown in about 185 bce
their decline began 60 years after ashokas rule ended , leading to the hellenistic reconquest by the greco - bactrians
much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the indo - greek kingdom
they were defeated and expelled by the indo - scythians in the late 2nd century bce
the silk road appeared during the first century bce , and afghanistan flourished with trade , with routes to china , india , persia and north to the cities of bukhara , samarkand and khiva in present - day uzbekistan
mainly from the badakhshan region
during the first century bce , the parthian empire subjugated the region but lost it to their indo - parthian vassals
in the mid - to - late first century ce the vast kushan empire , centered in afghanistan , became great patrons of buddhist culture , making buddhism flourish throughout the region
the kushans were overthrown by the sassanids in the 3rd century ce , though the indo - sassanids continued to rule at least parts of the region
they were followed by the kidarites who , in turn , was replaced by the hephthalites
they were replaced by the turk shahi in the 7th century
the buddhist turk shahi of kabul was replaced by a hindu dynasty before the saffarids conquered the area in 870 , this hindu dynasty was called hindu shahi
arab muslims brought islam to herat and zaranj in 642ce and began spreading eastward ; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted
before the arrival of islam , the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults , often resulting in syncretism between the dominant religions such as zoroastrianism , buddhism or greco - buddhism , ancient iranian religions ,
by the 11th century , mahmud of ghazni defeated the remaining hindu rulers and effectively islamized the wider region , mahmud made ghazni into an important city and patronized intellectuals such as the historian al - biruni and the poet ferdowsi
in 1219ce , genghis khan and his mongol army overran the region
his troops are said to have annihilated the khwarazmian cities of herat and balkh as well as bamyan
mongol rule continued with the ilkhanate in the northwest while the khalji dynasty administered the afghan tribal areas south of the hindu kush until the invasion of timur ( aka tamerlane ) , who established the timurid empire in 1370
under the rule of shah rukh the city served as the focal point of the timurid renaissance , whose glory matched florence of the italian renaissance as the center of a cultural rebirth
in the early 16th century , babur arrived from ferghana and captured kabul from the arghun dynasty
between the 16th and 18th century , the uzbek khanate of bukhara , iranian safavids , and indian mughals ruled parts of the territory
in 1709 , mirwais hotak , a local ghilzai tribal leader , successfully rebelled against the safavids
he defeated gurgin khan and established his own kingdom
mirwais died of natural causes in 1715 and was succeeded by his brother abdul aziz , who was soon killed by mirwais son mahmud for possibly planning to concede territories back to the safavids
mahmud led the afghan army in 1722 to the persian capital of isfahan , captured the city after the battle of gulnabad and proclaimed himself king of persia
the afghan dynasty was ousted from persia by nader shah after the 1729 battle of damghan
in 1738 , nader shah and his forces captured kandahar in the siege of kandahar , the last hotak stronghold , from shah hussain hotak
soon after , the persian and afghan forces invaded india , nader shah had plundered delhi , alongside his 16 year old commander , ahmad shah durrani who had assisted him on these campaigns
nader shah was assassinated in 1747
after the death of nader shah in 1747 , ahmad shah durrani had returned to kandahar with a contingent of 4 , 000 pashtuns
the abdalis had unanimously accepted ahmad shah as their new leader
with his acension in 1747 , ahmad shah had led multiple campaigns against the mughal empire , maratha empire , and then receding , afsharid empire
ahmad shah had captured kabul and peshawar from the mughal appointed governor , nasir khan
ahmad shah had then conquered herat in 1750 , and had also captured kashmir in 1752
his first campaign had seen the siege of mashhad , however he was forced to retreat after 4 months
in november 1750 , he moved to siege nishapur , however he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751
ahmad shah returned in 1754 , he captured tun , and on 23 july , he sieged mashhad once again
mashhad had fallen on 2 december , however shah rokh was reappointed in 1755
he was forced to give up torshiz , bakharz , jam , khaf , and turbat - e haidari to the afghans
following this , ahmad shah had sieged nishapur once again , and captured it
ahmad shah invaded india 8 times during his reign
with the capture of peshawar , ahmad shah had used this as a convenient striking point to lead his military campaigns into punjab and india
ahmad shah had sought out multiple reasons for his invasions , ahmad shah saw afghanistan in a dire state , and one that needed to expand and exploit a weak but rich neighboring country , which ahmad shah had capitalized on in multiple opportunities during his invasions of india , he sought the reasons needed to fill his treasury in a war - plunder conquest based economy
ahmad shah had returned the next year in 1749 , where he had captured the area around lahore and punjab , presenting it as an afghan victory for this campaign
from 1749 to 1767 , ahmad shah would lead 6 more invasions , the most important being his sixth invasion , with the third battle of panipat , which created a power vacumn in northern india , halting maratha expansion
ahmad shah durrani had died in october 1772 , what followed would be a civil war in succession , with his named successor , timur shah durrani succeeding him after the defeat of his brother , suleiman mirza
timur shah durrani ascended to the throne in november 1772 , having defeated a coalition under shah wali khan , the influential prime minister of the durrani empire , and humayun mirza
timur shah began his reign by consolidating power toward himself and people loyal to him , purging durrani sardars and influential tribal leaders in kabul and kandahar to bring support toward himself
timur shahs reforms also saw the capital of the durrani empire being shifted from kandahar to kabul , being able to cover the empire better as a base of ordination since it was essentially the heartland of the empire
this reform saw kabul as the modern capital of afghanistan today
having consolidated power to himself , timur shah would fight multiple series of rebellions to consolidate and hold the empire apart , timur shah would also lead campaigns into punjab against the sikhs like his father did , however being more successful
most prominent example of his battles during this campaign would be where timur shah led his forces under zangi khan durrani , with over 18 , 000 men total of afghan , qizilbash , and mongol cavalrymen
against over 60 , 000 sikh men
the sikhs would lose over 30 , 000 in this battle and would stage a durrani resurgence in punjab
incorporating it into the durrani empire once again , reintegrating it as a province until the siege of multan ( 1818 )
timur shah would be succeeded by his son , zaman shah durrani after his death on 18 or 20 may 1793
timur shahs reign oversaw the attempted stabilization and consolidation of the empire
however , timur shah had over 24 sons , a mistake that would plunge the empire in civil war over succession crises
zaman shah durrani would succeed to the durrani throne following the death of his father , timur shah durrani
this instigated civil war with his brothers , mahmud shah durrani , and humayun mirza revolting against him
with humayun centered in kandahar , and mahmud shah centered in herat
securing his position on the throne , zaman shah had led 3 campaigns into punjab , with the first two campaigns capturing lahore , but being forced to retreat due to issues from a possible qajar invasion , or his brother , mahmud shah durrani revolting
zaman shah embarked on his third campaign for punjab in 1800 to deal with a rebellious ranjit singh
however , just under 2 years in his reign , mahmud shah durrani would be deposed by his brother , shah shuja durrani , on 13 july 1803
where mahmud shah durrani would defeat and force shah shuja to flee , with shah mahmud usurping the throne again for his second reign beginning on 3 may 1809
by the early 19th century , the afghan empire was under threat from the persians in the west and the sikh empire in the east
afghanistan was divided , including the emirate of herat centered in the east
fateh khan , leader of the barakzai tribe , installed many of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire , mostly ruling as governors of major cities and provinces
after his murder for apparent treason against the durrani king
fateh khan would be sentenced by mahmud shah durrani , having him executed
his brothers , notably including dost mohammad khan , rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves
during this turbulent period , afghanistan had many temporary rulers until dost mohammad khan declared himself emir in 1826
punjab and kashmir were lost to ranjit singh , who invaded khyber pakhtunkhwa in march 1823 and captured the city of peshawar at the battle of nowshera
in 1837 , during the battle of jamrud near the khyber pass , akbar khan and the afghan army failed to capture the jamrud fort from the sikh khalsa army , but killed sikh commander hari singh nalwa , thus ending the afghan - sikh wars
by this time the british were advancing from the east and the first major conflict during the great game was initiated
in 1838 , a british expeditionary force marched into afghanistan and arrested dost mohammad , sent him into exile in india and replaced him with shah shuja , the former durrani king as a puppet on the throne

in 1893 , amir abdur rahman signed an agreement in which the ethnic pashtun and baloch territories were divided by the durand line , which forms the modern - day border between pakistan and afghanistan
shia - dominated hazarajat and pagan kafiristan remained politically independent until being conquered by abdur rahman khan in 1891–1896
he was known as the iron amir for his features and his ruthless methods against tribes
he died in 1901 , succeeded by his son , habibullah khan
during the first world war , when afghanistan was neutral , habibullah khan was met by officials of the central powers in the niedermayer–hentig expedition , to declare full independence from the united kingdom , join them and attack british india , as part of the hindu–german conspiracy
their efforts to bring afghanistan into the central powers failed , but it caused discontent among the population for keeping neutrality against the british
habibullah was assassinated during a hunting trip in february 1919 , and amanullah khan eventually assumed power
a staunch supporter of the 1915–1916 expeditions , amanullah khan provoked the third anglo - afghan war , entering british india via the khyber pass
after the end of the third anglo - afghan war and the signing of the treaty of rawalpindi on 19 august 1919 , emir amanullah khan declared the emirate of afghanistan a sovereign and fully independent state
he moved to end his countrys traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community , particularly with the soviet union and the weimar republic of germany
he proclaimed himself king of afghanistan on 9 june 1926 , when the emirate of afghanistan became the kingdom of afghanistan
following a 1927–28 tour of europe and turkey , he introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation
a key force behind these reforms was mahmud tarzi , an ardent supporter of the education of women
he fought for article 68 of afghanistans 1923 constitution , which made elementary education compulsory
the institution of slavery was abolished in the emirate of afghanistan in 1923
some of the reforms that were put in place , such as the abolition of the traditional burqa for women and the opening of several co - educational schools , quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders , and this led to the afghan civil war ( 1928–1929 )
faced with the overwhelming armed opposition , king amanullah abdicated in january 1929 , and soon after kabul fell to saqqawist forces led by habibullah kalakani
he abandoned the reforms of king amanullah in favor of a more gradual approach to modernization , but was assassinated in 1933 by abdul khaliq , a fifteen - year - old hazara student who was an amanullah loyalist
mohammed zahir shah , nadir shahs 19 - year - old son , succeeded to the throne and reigned as king from 1933 to 1973
the tribal revolts of 1944–1947 saw king zahirs reign challenged by zadran , safi , mangal , and wazir tribesmen led by mazrak zadran , salemai , and mirzali khan , among others , many of whom were amanullah loyalists
close relations with the muslim states turkey , the hashemite kingdom of iraq and iran / persia were also pursued , while further international relations were sought by joining the league of nations in 1934
the 1930s saw the development of roads , infrastructure , the founding of a national bank , and increased education
road links in the north played a large part in a growing cotton and textile industry
the country built close relationships with the axis powers , with nazi germany having the largest share in afghan development at the time , along with the kingdom of italy and the empire of japan
until 1946 , king zahir ruled with the assistance of his uncle , who held the post of prime minister and continued the policies of nadir shah
another of zahir shahs uncles , shah mahmud khan , became prime minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom , but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected
he was replaced in 1953 by mohammed daoud khan , the kings cousin and brother - in - law , and a pashtun nationalist who sought the creation of a pashtunistan , leading to highly tense relations with pakistan
king zahir shah , like his father nadir shah , had a policy of maintaining national independence while pursuing gradual modernization , creating nationalist feeling , and improving relations with the united kingdom
however , afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in world war ii nor aligned with either power bloc in the cold war thereafter
however , it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the soviet union and the united states vied for influence by building afghanistans main highways , airports , and other vital infrastructure in the post - war period
on a per capita basis , afghanistan received more soviet development aid than any other country
afghanistan had , therefore , good relations with both cold war enemies
in 1973 , while the king was in italy , daoud khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first president of afghanistan , abolishing the monarchy
in april 1978 , the communist peoples democratic party of afghanistan ( pdpa ) seized power in a bloody coup détat against then - president mohammed daoud khan , in what is called the saur revolution
the pdpa declared the establishment of the democratic republic of afghanistan , with its first leader named as peoples democratic party general secretary nur muhammad taraki
the pdpa initiated various social , symbolic and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition , while also brutally oppressing political dissidents
this caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of civil war by 1979 , waged by guerrilla mujahideen ( and smaller maoist guerrillas ) against regime forces countrywide
it quickly turned into a proxy war as the pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers , the united states supported them through pakistans inter - services intelligence ( isi ) , meanwhile , there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the pdpa– the dominant khalq and the more moderate parcham
in september 1979 , pdpa general secretary taraki was assassinated in an internal coup orchestrated by fellow khalq member , then - prime minister hafizullah amin , who assumed the new general secretary of the peoples democratic party
the situation in the country deteriorated under amin and thousands of people went missing
and 2million afghans , and some cities such as herat and kandahar were also damaged from bombardment
pakistans north - west frontier province functioned as an organizational and networking base for the anti - soviet afghan resistance , with the provinces influential deobandi ulama playing a major supporting role in promoting the jihad

the soviet - afghan war had drastic social effects on afghanistan
the militarization of society led to heavily armed police , private bodyguards , openly armed civil defense groups and other such things becoming the norm in afghanistan for decades thereafter

the current population growth rate is 2 , the population of afghanistan increased steadily until the 1980s , when civil war caused millions to flee to other countries such as pakistan
afghanistans healthcare has recovered since the turn of the century , causing falls in infant mortality and increases in life expectancy , although it has the lowest life expectance of any country outside africa
this ( along with other factors such as returning refugees ) caused rapid population growth in the 2000s that has only recently started to slow down

there are a number of smaller regional languages , including uzbek , turkmen , balochi , pashayi , and nuristani
when it comes to foreign languages among the populace , many are able to speak or understand hindustani ( urdu - hindi ) , partly due to returning afghan refugees from pakistan and the popularity of bollywood films respectively

urbanization has increased rapidly , particularly in the capital kabul , due to returning refugees from pakistan and iran after 2001 , internally displaced people , and rural migrants
the only city with over a million residents is its capital , kabul , located in the east of the country
the other large cities are located generally in the ring around the central highlands , namely kandahar in the south , herat in the west , mazar - i - sharif and kunduz in the north , and jalalabad in the east

following the effective collapse of the islamic republic of afghanistan during the 2021 taliban offensive , the taliban declared the country an islamic emirate
a new caretaker government was announced on 7 september
as of 8 september 2021 , no other country had formally recognized the islamic emirate of afghanistan as the de jure government of afghanistan
a traditional instrument of governance in afghanistan is the loya jirga ( grand assembly ) , a pashtun consultative meeting that was mainly organized for choosing a new head of state , adopting a new constitution , or to settle national or regional issue such as war
with the most recent one occurring in august 2020
on 17 august 2021 , the leader of the taliban - affiliated hezb - e - islami gulbuddin party , gulbuddin hekmatyar , met with both hamid karzai , the former president of afghanistan , and abdullah abdullah , the former chairman of the high council for national reconciliation and former chief executive , in doha , qatar , with the aim of forming a national unity government
president ashraf ghani , having fled the country during the taliban advance to either tajikistan or uzbekistan , emerged in the united arab emirates and said that he supported such negotiations and was in talks to return to afghanistan
many figures within the taliban generally agreed that continuation of the 2004 constitution of afghanistan may , potentially , be workable as the basis for the new state as their objections to the former government were religious , and not political , in nature
hours after the final flight of american troops left kabul on 30 august , a taliban official interviewed said that a new government would likely be announced as early as friday 3 september after jumuah
it was added that hibatullah akhundzada would be officially named emir , with cabinet ministers being revealed at the arg in an official ceremony
abdul ghani baradar would be named head of government as prime minister , while other important positions would go to sirajuddin haqqani and mullah yaqoob

the discovered objects in a cave near xarrë include flint and jasper objects along with fossilised animal bones , while those discoveries at mount dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the aurignacian culture

231 the leading dans of both groups buried their dead under a circular tumulus of soil in the second millennium bc the main reservoir of the greek speakers was central albania and epirus , and it was from there that the founders of mycenaean civilization came to mycenae , c
1600 bc , and buried their nobles in grave circle further waves of immigrants passing through and from epirus people the greek peninsula and islands the last wave , called dorians , settling from 1100 onwards
the lands they left in central albania were occupied during the so - called dark age ( u10 - 800bc ) by illyrians , whose main habitat was in the area now called bosnia ,
in ancient times , the incorporated territory of albania was historically inhabited by indo - european peoples , among them numerous illyrian tribes , ancient greeks and thracians
in view of the illyrian tribes , there is no evidence that these tribes used any collective nomenclature for themselves , while it is regarded to be unlikely that they used a common endonym
the territory referred to as illyria corresponded roughly to the area east of the adriatic sea in the mediterranean sea extending in the south to the mouth of the vjosë
the first account of the illyrian groups comes from periplus of the euxine sea , an ancient greek text written in the middle of the 4th century bc
the west was inhabited by the thracian tribe of the bryges while the south was inhabited by the ancient greek - speaking tribe of the chaonians , whose capital was at phoenice
other colonies such as apollonia , epidamnos , and amantia , were established by ancient greek city - states on the coast by the 7th century bc
the illyrian ardiaei tribe , centred in montenegro , ruled over most of the territory of albania
their ardiaean kingdom reached its greatest extent under king agron , the son of pleuratus ii
agron extended his rule over other neighbouring tribes as well
in 229 bc , rome declared war gentius clashed with the romans in 168bc , initiating the third illyrian war
the conflict resulted in roman conquest of the region by 167bc
the romans split the region into three administrative divisions
the roman empire was split in 395 upon the death of theodosius i into an eastern and western roman empire in part because of the increasing pressure from threats during the barbarian invasions
from the 6th century into the 7th century , the slavs crossed the danube and largely absorbed the indigenous ancient greeks , illyrians and thracians in the balkans ; thus , the illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th century
in the 11th century , the great schism formalised the break of communion between the eastern orthodox and western catholic church that is reflected in albania through the emergence of a catholic north and orthodox south
the albanian people inhabited the west of lake ochrida and the upper valley of river shkumbin and established the principality of arbanon in 1190 under the leadership of progon of kruja
the realm was succeeded by his sons gjin and dhimitri
upon the death of dhimiter , the territory came under the rule of the albanian - greek gregory kamonas and subsequently under the golem of kruja
towards the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th centuries , serbs and venetians started to take possession over the territory
at this point the albanians were fully christianised
few years after the dissolution of arbanon , charles of anjou concluded an agreement with the albanian rulers , promising to protect them and their ancient liberties
in 1272 , he established the kingdom of albania and conquered regions back from the despotate of epirus
the kingdom claimed all of central albania territory from dyrrhachium along the adriatic sea coast down to butrint
a catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading catholicism in the balkan peninsula
this plan found also the support of helen of anjou , a cousin of charles of anjou
around 30 catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule mainly in northern albania
internal power struggles within the byzantine empire in the 14th century enabled serbs most powerful medieval ruler , stefan dusan , to establish a short - lived empire that included all of albania except durrës
in 1367 , various albanian rulers established the despotate of arta
during that time , several albanian principalities were created , notably the principality of albania , principality of kastrioti , lordship of berat and principality of dukagjini
in the first half of the 15th century , the ottoman empire invaded most of albania , and the league of lezhë was held under skanderbeg as a ruler , who became the national hero of the albanian medieval history
with the fall of constantinople , the ottoman empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into southeast europe
they reached the albanian ionian sea coast in 1385 and erected their garrisons across southern albania in 1415 and then occupied most of albania in 1431
the albanians , as christians , were considered an inferior class of people , and as such they were subjected to heavy taxes among others by the devshirme system that allowed the sultan to collect a requisite percentage of christian adolescents from their families to compose the janissary
the ottoman conquest was also accompanied with the gradual process of islamisation and the rapid construction of mosques which consequently modified the religious picture of albania
a prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of the assembly of lezhë until the siege of shkodër under the leadership of gjergj kastrioti skanderbeg , multiple times defeating major ottoman armies led by sultans murad ii and mehmed ii
skanderbeg managed to gather several of the albanian principals , amongst them the arianitis , dukagjinis , zaharias and thopias , and establish a centralised authority over most of the non - conquered territories , becoming the lord of albania
skanderbeg consistently pursued the goal relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to constitute a european coalition against the ottomans
he thwarted every attempt by the ottomans to regain albania , which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of italy and western europe
his unequal fight against them won the esteem of europe also among others financial and military aid from the papacy and naples , venice and ragusa
when the ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region , albanian towns were organised into four principal sanjaks
the government fostered trade by settling a sizeable jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in spain
the city of vlorë saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from europe such as velvets , cotton goods , mohairs , carpets , spices and leather from bursa and constantinople
some citizens of vlorë even had business associates throughout europe
the phenomenon of islamisation among the albanians became primarily widespread from the 17th century and continued into the 18th century
islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement within the ottoman empire
however , motives for conversion were , according to some scholars , diverse depending on the context though the lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues
because of increasing suppression of catholicism , most catholic albanians converted in the 17th century , while orthodox albanians followed suit mainly in the following century
since the albanians were seen as strategically important , they made up a significant proportion of the ottoman military and bureaucracy
a couple of muslim albanians attained important political and military positions who culturally contributed to the broader muslim world

the albanian renaissance was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century , during which the albanian people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an independent nation
modern albanian culture flourished too , especially albanian literature and arts , and was frequently linked to the influences of the romanticism and enlightenment principles
prior to the rise of nationalism , albania was under the rule of the ottoman empire for almost five centuries , and ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or conscience by the albanian people
through literature , albanians started to make a conscious effort to awaken feelings of pride and unity among their people that would call to mind the rich history and hopes for a more decent future
the victory of russia over the ottoman empire following the russian - ottoman wars resulted the execution of the treaty of san stefano which overlooked to assign albanian - populated lands to the slavic and greek neighbours
however , the united kingdom and austro - hungarian empire consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the treaty of berlin
from this point , albanians started to organise themselves with the goal to protect and unite the albanian - populated lands into a unitary nation , leading to the formation of the league of prizren
the league had initially the assistance of the ottoman authorities whose position was based on the religious solidarity of muslim people and landlords connected with the ottoman administration
they favoured and protected the muslim solidarity and called for defence of muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the league committee of the real muslims
approximately 300 muslims participated in the assembly composed by delegates from bosnia , the administrator of the sanjak of prizren as representatives of the central authorities and no delegates from vilayet of scutari
ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league , under abdyl frashëri , became focused on working towards albanian autonomy and requested merging four vilayets , including kosovo , shkodër , monastir and ioannina , into an unified vilayet , the albanian vilayet
the league used military force to prevent the annexing areas of plav and gusinje assigned to montenegro
after several successful battles with montenegrin troops , such as the battle of novšiće , the league was forced to retreat from their contested regions
the league was later defeated by the ottoman army sent by the sultan
albania declared independence from the ottoman empire on 28 november 1912 , accompanied with the establishment of the senate and government by the assembly of vlorë on 4 december 1912
its sovereignty was recognised by the conference of london
on 29 july 1913 , the treaty of london delineated the borders of the country and its neighbours , leaving many albanians outside albania , predominantly partitioned between montenegro , serbia and greece
headquartered in vlorë , the international commission of control was established on 15 october 1913 to take care of the administration of newly established albania , until its own political institutions were in order
the international gendarmerie was established as the first law enforcement agency of the principality of albania
in november , the first gendarmerie members arrived in the country
prince of albania wilhelm of wied ( princ vilhelm vidi ) was selected as the first prince of the principality
on 7 march , he arrived in the provisional capital of durrës and started to organise his government , appointing turhan pasha përmeti to form the first albanian cabinet
in november 1913 , the albanian pro - ottoman forces had offered the throne of albania to the ottoman war minister of albanian origin , ahmed izzet pasha
in february 1914 , the autonomous republic of northern epirus was proclaimed in gjirokastër by the local greek population against incorporation to albania
this initiative was short - lived , and in 1921 the southern provinces were incorporated into the albanian principality
meanwhile , the revolt of albanian peasants against the new albanian regime erupted under the leadership of the group of muslim clerics gathered around essad pasha toptani , who proclaimed himself the saviour of albania and islam
in order to gain support of the mirdita catholic volunteers from the northern part of albania , prince wied appointed their leader , prênk bibë doda , to be the foreign minister of the principality of albania
in may and june 1914 , the international gendarmerie was joined by isa boletini and his men , mostly from kosovo , the regime of prince wied collapsed , and he left the country on 3 september 1914
following the end of the government of fan noli , the parliament adopted a new constitution and proclaimed the country as a parliamentary republic in which king zog i of albania ( ahmet muhtar zogu ) served as the head of state for a seven - year term
immediately after , tirana was endorsed officially as the countrys permanent capital
the politics of zogu was authoritarian and conservative with the primary aim of the maintenance of stability and order
he was forced to adopt a policy of cooperation with italy where a pact had been signed between both countries , whereby italy gained a monopoly on shipping and trade concessions
in 1928 , the country was eventually replaced by another monarchy with a strong support by the fascist regime of italy however , both maintained close relations until the italian invasion of the country
zogu remained a conservative but initiated reforms and placed great emphasis on the development of infrastructure
in an attempt at social modernisation , the custom of adding ones region to ones name was dropped
he also made donations of land to international organisations for the building of schools and hospitals
the armed forces were trained and supervised by instructors from italy , and as a counterweight , he kept british officers in the gendarmerie despite strong italian pressure to remove them
after being militarily occupied by italy from 1939 until 1943 , the kingdom of albania was a protectorate and a dependency of the kingdom of italy governed by victor emmanuel iii and his government
in october 1940 , albania served as a staging ground for an unsuccessful italian invasion of greece
a counterattack resulted in a sizeable portion of southern albania coming under greek military control until april 1941 when greece capitulated during the german invasion
in april 1941 , territories of yugoslavia with substantial albanian population were annexed to albania inclusively western macedonia , a strip of eastern montenegro , the town of tutin in central serbia and most of kosovo
germans started to occupy the country in september 1943 and subsequently announced that they would recognise the independence of a neutral albania and set about organising a new government , military and law enforcement
balli kombëtar , which had fought against italy , formed a neutral government and side by side with the germans fought against the communist - led national liberation movement of albania
during the last years of the war , the country fell into a civil war - like state between the communists and nationalists
the communists defeated the last anti - communist forces in the south in 1944
before the end of november , the main german troops had withdrawn from tirana , and the communists took control by attacking it
the partisans entirely liberated the country from german occupation on 29 november 1944
a provisional government , which the communists had formed atberatin october , administered albania with enver hoxha as the head of government
by the end of the second world war , the main military and political force of the nation , the communist party sent forces to northern albania against the nationalists to eliminate its rivals
they faced open resistance in nikaj - mërtur , dukagjin and kelmend led by prek cali
people were killed or tortured
this event was the starting point of many other issues which took place during enver hoxhas dictatorship
class struggle was strictly applied , human freedom and human rights were denied
the kelmend region was almost isolated by both the border and by a lack of roads for another 20 years , the institution of agricultural cooperatives brought about economic decline
many kelmendi people fled , and some were executed trying to cross the border
in the aftermath of world war ii and the defeat of the axis powers , the country became initially a satellite state of the soviet union , and enver hoxha emerged as the leader of the newly established peoples republic of albania
soviet - albanian relations began to deteriorate after stalins death in 1953
at this point , the country started to develop foreign relations with other communist countries , among others with the peoples republic of china
during this period , the country experienced an increasing industrialisation and urbanisation , a rapid collectivisation and economic growth which led to a higher standard of living
the government called for the development of infrastructure and most notably the introduction of a railway system that completely revamped transportation
the new land reform laws were passed granting ownership of the land to the workers and peasants who tilled it
agriculture became cooperative , and production increased significantly , leading to the country becoming agriculturally self - sufficient
in the field of education , illiteracy was eliminated among the countrys adult population
the government also oversaw the emancipation of women and the expansion of healthcare and education throughout the country
the average annual increase in the countrys national income was 29 and 56 higher than the world and european average , respectively
today a secular state without any official religion , religious freedoms and practises were severely curtailed during the communist era with all forms of worship being outlawed
in 1945 , the agrarian reform law meant that large swaths of property owned by religious groups were nationalised , mostly the waqfs along with the estates of mosques , tekkes , monasteries and dioceses
many believers , along with the ulema and many priests , were arrested and executed
in 1949 , a new decree on religious communities required that all their activities be sanctioned by the state alone
after hundreds of mosques and dozens of islamic libraries containing priceless manuscripts were destroyed , hoxha proclaimed albania the worlds first atheist state in 1967
the churches had not been spared either and many were converted into cultural centres for young people
a 1967 law banned all fascist , religious , and antisocialist activity and propaganda
preaching religion carried a three to ten - year prison sentence
nonetheless , many albanians continued to practise their beliefs secretly
the anti - religious policy of hoxha attained its most fundamental legal and political expression a decade later the state recognises no religion , states the 1976 constitution , and supports and carries out atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people
after forty years of communism and isolation as well as the revolutions of 1989 , people , most notably students , became politically active and campaigned against the government that led to the transformation of the existing order
following the popular support in the first multi - party elections of 1991 , the communists retained a stronghold in the parliament until the victory in the general elections of 1992 led by the democratic party
considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to pyramid schemes that were widely supported by the government
the schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country
despite the warnings of the international monetary fund , sali berisha defended the schemes as large investment firms , leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes
the schemes began to collapse in late 1996 , leading many of the investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government , requesting their money back
the protests turned violent in february 1997 as government forces responded by firing on the demonstrators
in march , the police and republican guard deserted , leaving their armouries open
these were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs
the resulting civil war caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees
the crisis led both aleksandër meksi and sali berisha to resign from office in the wake of the general election
in april 1997 , operation alba , a un peacekeeping force led by italy , entered the country with two goals exclusively to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and to secure the ground for international organisations
the main international organisation that was involved was the western european unions multinational albanian police element , which worked with the government to restructure the judicial system and simultaneously the albanian police
following the disintegration of the communist system , albania focused on an active process of westernisation with the goal of accession to the european union ( eu ) and the north atlantic treaty organisation ( nato )

on 9 march 2020 , covid - 19 was confirmed to have spread to albania
from march to june 2020 , the government declared a state of emergency as a measure to limit the rapid spread of the pandemic in the country

in the country , education is secular , free , compulsory and based on three levels of education segmented in primary , secondary and tertiary education
the academic year is apportioned into two semesters beginning in september or october , and ending in june or july
albanian serves as the primary language of instruction in all academic institutions across the country

the countrys tertiary education , an optional stage of formal learning following secondary education , has undergone a thorough reformation and restructuring in compliance with the principles of the bologna process
there is a significant number of private and public institutions of higher education well dispersed in the major cities of albania
studies in tertiary education are organised at three successive levels which include the bachelor , master and doctorate
the constitution of albania guarantees equal , free and universal health care for all its citizens
the average healthy life expectancy is at 68 years and ranks as well 37th in the world
cardiovascular disease remain the principal cause of death in the country accounting 52 of total deaths
accidents , injuries , malignant and respiratory diseases are other primary causes of death
neuropsychiatric disease has also increased due to recent demographic , social and economic changes in the country
in 2009 , the country had a fruit and vegetable supply of 886 grams per capita per day , the fifth highest supply in europe
due to its geographical location and natural resources , albania has a wide variety of energy resources ranging from gas , oil and coal , to wind , solar and water as well as other renewable sources
currently , the electricity generation sector of albania is dependent on hydroelectricity simultaneously ranking fifth in the world in percentage terms
albania has considerably large deposits of oil
it has the 10th largest oil reserves in europe and the 58th in the world
after the completion of the trans adriatic pipeline ( tap ) , albania will be significantly connected to the planned southern gas corridor , that will transport natural gas from the caspian sea through albania to europe

the water resources of albania are particularly abundant in all the regions of the country and comprise lakes , rivers , springs and groundwater aquifers
after the fall of communism in 1991 , human resources in sciences and technology in albania have drastically decreased
as of various reports , during 1991 to 2005 approximately 50 of the professors and scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have left albania
it aims to triple public spending on research and development to 0 of gdp and augment the share of gde from foreign sources , including the framework programmes for research of the european union , to the point where it covers 40 of research spending , among others
albania was ranked 84th in the global innovation index in 2021
telecommunication represents one of the fastest growing and dynamic sectors in albania
vodafone albania , telekom albania and albtelecom are the three large providers of mobile and internet in albania
as of the electronic and postal communications authority ( akep ) in 2018 , the country had approximately 2 million active mobile users with almost 1 million active broadband subscribers
vodafone albania alone served more than 931 , 000 mobile users , telekom albania had about 605 , 000 users and albtelecom had more than 272 , 000 users
as defined by the institute of statistics ( instat ) , the population of albania was estimated in 2020 at 2 , 845 , 955
its population density stands at 259 inhabitants per square kilometre
the overall life expectancy at birth is 78 years ; 75 years for males and 81 years for females
the country is the 8th most populous country in the balkans and ranks as the 137th most populous country in the world
the countrys population rose steadily from 2million in 1979 until 1989 , when it peaked at 3million
the explanation for the recent population decrease is the fall of communism in albania in the late twentieth century
that period was marked by economic mass emigration from albania to greece , italy and the united states
four decades of total isolation from the world , combined with its disastrous economic , social and political situation , had caused this exodus
the external migration was prohibited outright during the communist era , while internal migration was quite limited , hence this was a new phenomenon
at least 900 , 000 people left albania during this period , with about 600 , 000 of them settling in greece
the migration affected the countrys internal population distribution
it decreased particularly in the north and south , while it increased in the centre within the cities of tirana and durrës
about 53 of the countrys population lives in cities
the three largest counties by population account for half of the total population
almost 30 of the total population is found in tirana county followed by fier county with 11 and durrës county with 10
tirana is one of largest cities in the balkan peninsula and ranks seventh with a population about 400 , 000
the second largest city in the country by population is durrës , with a population of 113 , 000 , followed by vlorë with a population of 104 , 513
issues of ethnicity are a delicate topic and subject to debate
contrary to official statistics that show an over 97 per cent albanian majority in the country , minority groups ( such as greeks , macedonians , montenegrins , roma and aromanians ) have frequently disputed the official numbers , asserting a higher percentage of the countrys population
according to the disputed 2011 census , ethnic affiliation was as follows albanians 2 , 312 , 356 ( 82 of the total ) , greeks 24 , 243 ( 0 ) , macedonians 5 , 512 ( 0 ) , montenegrins 366 ( 0 ) , aromanians 8 , 266 ( 0 ) , romani 8 , 301 ( 0 ) , balkan egyptians 3 , 368 ( 0 ) , other ethnicities 2 , 644 ( 0 ) , no declared ethnicity 390 , 938 ( 14 ) , and not relevant 44 , 144 ( 1 )
on the quality of the specific data the advisory committee on the framework convention for the protection of national minorities stated that the results of the census should be viewed with the utmost caution and calls on the authorities not to rely exclusively on the data on nationality collected during the census in determining its policy on the protection of national minorities
albania recognises nine national or cultural minorities aromanian , greek , macedonian , montenegrin , serb , roma , egyptian , bosnian and bulgarian peoples
regarding the greeks , it is difficult to know how many greeks there are in albania
the estimates vary between 60 , 000 and 300 , 000 ethnic greeks in albania
according to ian jeffries , most of western sources put the number at around 200 , 000
the 300 , 000 mark is supported by greek government as well
of the total population
the us state department estimates that greeks make up 1 , and other minorities 0 , of the population
macedonians and some greek minority groups have sharply criticised article 20 of the census law , according to which a 1 , 000 fine will be imposed on anyone who will declare an ethnicity other than what is stated on his or her birth certificate
this is claimed to be an attempt to intimidate minorities into declaring albanian ethnicity ; according to them the albanian government has stated that it will jail anyone who does not participate in the census or refuse to declare his or her ethnicity
the amendments criticised do not include jailing or forced declaration of ethnicity or religion ; only a fine is envisioned which can be overthrown by court
greek representatives form part of the albanian parliament and the government has invited albanian greeks to register , as the only way to improve their status
on the other hand , nationalists , various organisations and political parties in albania have expressed their concern that the census might artificially increase the numbers of the greek minority , which might be then exploited by greece to threaten albanias territorial integrity
the official language of the country is albanian which is spoken by the vast majority of the countrys population
macedonian is official in the pustec municipality in east albania
according to the 2011 population census , 2 , 765 , 610 or 98 of the population declared albanian as their mother tongue ( mother tongue is defined as the first or main language spoken at home during childhood )
in recent years , the shrinking number of pupils in schools dedicated to the greek minority has caused problems for teachers
in a 2017 study carried out by instat , the albanian government statistical agency , 39 of the 25–64 years old is able to use at least one foreign language , with english first at 40 , followed by italian with 27 and greek with 22
greek is the second most - spoken language in the country , with 0 to 3 of the population speaking it as first language , as of 2003 greek was offered at over 100 private tutoring centres all over albania and at a private school in tirana , the first of its kind outside greece
young people have shown a growing interest in german language in recent years
some of them go to germany for studying or various experiences
albania and germany have agreements for cooperating in helping young people of the two countries know both cultures better
as of the 2011 census , there were 1 , 587 , 608 ( 56 ) sunni muslims , 280 , 921 ( 10 ) roman catholics , 188 , 992 ( 6 ) eastern orthodox , 58 , 628 ( 2 ) bektashi muslims , 3 , 797 ( 0 ) evangelicals , 1 , 919 ( 0 ) other christians , 602 ( 0 ) of other religions and 153 , 630 ( 5 ) believers without denomination in albania
religion constitute an important role in the lives of only 39 of the countrys population
the preliminary results of the 2011 census seemed to give widely different results , with 70 of respondents refusing to declare belief in any of the listed faiths
the albanian orthodox church officially refused to recognize the results , claiming that 24 of the total population adhered to its faith
some muslim community officials expressed unhappiness with the data claiming that many muslims were not counted and that the number of adherents numbered some 70 of the albanian population
the albanian catholic bishops conference also cast doubts on the census , complaining that many of its believers were not contacted
in 2008 , there were 694 catholic churches and 425 orthodox churches , 568 mosques and 70 bektashi tekkes in the country
albania is a secular and religiously diverse country with no official religion and thus , freedom of religion , belief and conscience are guaranteed under the countrys constitution
during classical times , there are thought to have been about seventy christian families in durrës , as early as the time of the apostles
it later emerged as the majority religion , during centuries of ottoman rule , though a significant christian minority remained
during modern times , the albanian republican , monarchic and later communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life
the country has never had an official religion either as a republic or as a kingdom
in the 20th century , the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s , under the state policy of obliterating all organised religion from the territories of albania
the communist regime persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion
the country was then officially declared to be the worlds first atheist state
religious freedom has returned , however , since the end of communism
islam survived communist era persecution and reemerged in the modern era as a practised religion in albania
albania shares many symbols associated with its history , culture and belief
these include the colours red and black , animals such as the golden eagle living across the country , costumes such as the fustanella , plis and opinga which are worn to special events and celebrations , plants such as the olive and red poppy growing as well across the country
the flag of albania is a red flag with a black double - headed eagle positioned in the centre
gjergj kastrioti skënderbeu , who fought and began a rebellion against the ottoman empire which halted ottoman advance into europe for nearly 25 years , placed the double - headed eagle on his flag and seal
the countrys national motto , ti shqipëri , më jep nder , më jep emrin shqipëtar ( you albania , you give me honour , you give me the name albanian ) , finds its origins in the albanian national awakening
the first to express this motto was naim frashëri in his poem ti shqipëri më jep nder
the artistic history of albania has been particularly influenced by a multitude of ancient and medieval people , traditions and religions
it covers a broad spectrum with mediums and disciplines that include painting , pottery , sculpture , ceramics and architecture all of them exemplifying a great variety in style and shape , in different regions and period
the rise of the byzantine and ottoman empire in the middle ages was accompanied by a corresponding growth in christian and islamic art in the lands of albania which are apparent in examples of architecture and mosaics throughout the country
however , onufri , kolë idromeno , david selenica , kostandin shpataraku and the zografi brothers are the most eminent representatives of albanian art
the architecture of albania reflects the legacy of various civilisations tracing back to the classical antiquity
major cities in albania have evolved from within the castle to include dwellings , religious and commercial structures , with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques
nowadays , the cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of various architectural styles
in the 20th century , many historical as well as sacred buildings bearing the ancient influence were demolished during the communist era
ancient architecture is found throughout albania and most visible in byllis , amantia , phoenice , apollonia , butrint , antigonia , shkodër and durrës
considering the long period of rule of the byzantine empire , they introduced castles , citadels , churches and monasteries with spectacular wealth of visible murals and frescos
perhaps the best known examples can be found in the southern albanian cities and surroundings of korçë , berat , voskopojë and gjirokastër
involving the introduction of ottoman architecture there was a development of mosques and other islamic buildings , particularly seen in berat and gjirokastër
a productive period of historicism , art nouveau and neoclassicism merged into the 19th century , best exemplified in korçë
the 20th century brought new architectural styles such as the modern italian style , which is present in tirana such as the skanderbeg square and ministries
it is also present in shkodër , vlorë , sarandë and durrës
moreover , other towns received their present - day albania - unique appearance through various cultural or economic influences
socialist classicism arrived during the communist era in albania after the second world war
at this period many socialist - styled complexes , wide roads and factories were constructed , while town squares were redesigned and numerous of historic and important buildings demolished
notable examples of that style include the mother teresa square , pyramid of tirana , palace of congresses and so on
three albanian archaeological sites are included in the list of unesco world heritage sites
these include the ancient remains of butrint , the medieval historic centres of berat and gjirokastër , and natural and cultural heritage of the ohrid region site shared with north macedonia since 2019
furthermore , the royal illyrian tombs , the remains of apollonia , the ancient amphitheatre of durrës and the fortress of bashtovë has been included on the tentative list of albania
throughout the centuries , albanian cuisine has been widely influenced by albanian culture , geography and history , and as such , different parts of the country enjoy specific regional cuisines
cooking traditions especially vary between the north and the south , owing to differing topography and climate that essentially contribute to the excellent growth conditions for a wide array of herbs , fruits , and vegetables
albanians produce and use many varieties of fruits such as lemons , oranges , figs , and most notably , olives , which are perhaps the most important element of albanian cooking
spices and other herbs such as basil , lavender , mint , oregano , rosemary , and thyme are widely used , as are vegetables such as garlic , onions , peppers , potatoes , tomatoes , as well as legumes of all types
with a coastline along the adriatic and ionian in the mediterranean sea , fish , crustaceans , and seafood are a popular and an integral part of the albanian diet
otherwise , lamb is the traditional meat for different holidays and religious festivals for both christians and muslims , although poultry , beef , and pork are also in plentiful supply
tavë kosi ( soured milk casserole ) is the national dish of albania , consisting of lamb and rice baked under a thick , tart veil of yoghurt
fërgesë is another national dish , made up of peppers , tomatoes , and cottage cheese
pite is also popular , a baked pastry with a filling of a mixture of spinach and gjizë ( curd ) or mish ( ground meat )
petulla , a traditional fried dough , is also a popular speciality , and is served with powdered sugar or feta cheese and different sorts of fruit jams flia consists of multiple crêpe - like layers brushed with cream and served with sour cream
krofne , similar to berliner doughnuts , are filled with jam , or chocolate and often eaten during cold winter months
coffee is an integral part of the albanian lifestyle
the country has more coffee houses per capita than any other country in the world
tea is also enjoyed both at home or outside at cafés , bars , or restaurants
çaj mali ( sideritis tea ) is enormously beloved , and a part of the daily routine for most albanians
it is cultivated across southern albania and noted for its medicinal properties
black tea with a slice of lemon and sugar , milk , or honey is also popular
albanian wine is also common throughout the country , and has been cultivated for thousands of years
albania has a long and ancient history of wine production , and belongs to the old world of wine producing countries
its wine is characterised by its sweet taste and traditionally indigenous varieties
the freedom of press and speech , and the right to free expression is guaranteed in the constitution of albania
nevertheless , in the 2020 report of freedom in the world , the freedom house classified the freedoms of press and speech in albania as partly free from political interference and manipulation
radio televizioni shqiptar ( rtsh ) is the national broadcaster corporation of albania operating numerous television and radio stations in the country
the three major private broadcaster corporations are top channel , televizioni klan and vizion plus whose content are distributed throughout albania and beyond its territory in kosovo and other albanian - speaking territories
albanian cinema has its roots in the 20th century and developed after the countrys declaration of independence
the first movie theater exclusively devoted to showing motion pictures was built in 1912 in shkodër by an austrian distribution company with strong efforts by albanian painter kolë idromeno
the opening of other movie theaters followed by 1920 in shkodër , berat , tirana and vlorë
during the peoples republic of albania , albanian cinema developed rapidly with the inauguration of the kinostudio shqipëria e re in tirana
in 1953 , the albanian - soviet epic film , the great warrior skanderbeg , was released chronicling the life and fight of the medieval albanian hero skanderbeg
it went on to win the international prize at the 1954 cannes film festival
in 2003 , the tirana international film festival was established , the largest film festival in the country
durrës is host to the durrës international film festival , the second largest film festival , taking place at the durrës amphitheatre
albanian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity , and continues to play a major part in overall albanian music
folk music can be divided into two stylistic groups , mainly the northern gheg varieties , and southern lab and tosk varieties
northern and southern traditions are contrasted by a rugged tone from the north , and the more relaxed southern form of music
many songs concern events from albanian history and culture , including traditional themes of honour , hospitality , treachery , and revenge
the first compilation of albanian folk music was made by two himariot musicians , neço muka and koço çakali , in paris , during their work with albanian soprano tefta tashko - koço
several gramophone compilations were recorded at the time by the three artists , which eventually led to the recognition of albanian iso - polyphony as a unesco intangible cultural heritage
festivali i këngës is a traditional albanian song contest organised by the national broadcaster radio televizioni shqiptar ( rtsh )
the festival is celebrated annually since its inauguration in 1962 and has launched the careers of some of albanias most successful singers including vaçe zela and parashqevi simaku

contemporary artists rita ora , bebe rexha , era istrefi , dua lipa , ava max , bleona , elvana gjata , ermonela jaho , and inva mula have achieved international recognition for their music , albanian opera singer saimir pirgu was nominated for the 2017 grammy award
every cultural and geographical region of albania has its own specific variety of costume that vary in style , material , colour , shape , detail , and form
presently , national costumes are most often worn during special events and celebrations , mostly at ethnic festivals , religious holidays , weddings , and by performing dance groups
some elderly people continue to wear traditional clothing in their daily lives
clothing was traditionally made mainly from local materials such as leather , wool , linen , hemp fibre , and silk ; albanian textiles are still embroidered in elaborate ancient patterns
the albanian language comprises an independent branch and is a language isolate within the indo - european family of languages ; it is not connected to any other known living language in europe
its origin is conclusively unknown , but it is believed to have descended from an ancient paleo - balkan language
, ( although there are some lexical items that appear to be shared between romanian ( and by extension dacian ) and albanian , by far the strongest connections can be argued between albanian and illyrian
concise encyclopedia of languages of the world by keith brown , sarah ogilvie contributor keith brown , sarah ogilvie edition illustrated published by elsevier , 2008 ( albanian constitutes a single branch of the indo - european family of languages
it is often held to be related to illyrian , a poorly attested language spoken in the western balkans in classical times page 22 )
the cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the albanian language in the area of church texts and publications , mainly of the catholic region in the northern of albania , but also of the orthodox in the south
the protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition , when cleric gjon buzuku translated the catholic liturgy into albanian , trying to do for albanian what martin luther had done for german
meshari ( the missal ) written by gjon buzuku was published in 1555 and is considered one of the first literary work of written albanian during the middle ages
the refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written albanian , a tradition that is not well understood
however , there is some fragmented evidence , pre - dating buzuku , which indicates that albanian was written from at least the 14th century
the earliest evidence dates from 1332ad with a latin report from the french dominican guillelmus adae , archbishop of antivari , who wrote that albanians used latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from latin
other significant examples include a baptism formula ( unte paghesont premenit atit et birit et spertit senit ) from 1462 , written in albanian within a latin text by the bishop of durrës , pal engjëlli ; a glossary of albanian words of 1497 by arnold von harff , a german who had travelled through albania , and a 15th - century fragment of the bible from the gospel of matthew , also in albanian , but written in greek letters
albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only , but historical chronicles too
they are mentioned by the humanist marin barleti , who in his book siege of shkodër ( rrethimi i shkodrës ) from 1504 , confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people ( in vernacula lingua ) as well as his famous biography of skanderbeg historia de vita et gestis scanderbegi epirotarum principis ( history of skanderbeg ) from 1508
the history of skanderbeg is still the foundation of skanderbeg studies and is considered an albanian cultural treasure , vital to the formation of albanian national self - consciousness
during the 16th and the 17th centuries , the catechism ( e mbësuame krishterë ) ( christian teachings ) from 1592 written by lekë matrënga , ( doktrina e krishterë ) ( the christian doctrine ) from 1618 and ( rituale romanum ) 1621 by pjetër budi , the first writer of original albanian prose and poetry , an apology for george castriot ( 1636 ) by frang bardhi , who also published a dictionary and folklore creations , the theological - philosophical treaty cuneus prophetarum ( the band of prophets ) ( 1685 ) by pjetër bogdani , the most universal personality of albanian middle ages , were published in albanian
the most famous albanian writer in the 20th and 21st century is probably ismail kadare
he has been mentioned as a possible recipient of the nobel prize in literature several times
albania participated at the olympic games in 1972 for the first time
the country made their winter olympic games debut in 2006

historically , the albanian people have established several communities in many regions throughout southern europe
the albanian diaspora has been formed since the late middle ages , when they emigrated to places such as italy , especially in sicily and calabria , and greece to escape either various socio - political difficulties or the ottoman conquest of albania
following the fall of communism , large numbers of albanians have migrated to countries such as australia , canada , france , germany , greece , italy , scandinavia , switzerland , united kingdom and the united states
albanian minorities are present in the neighbouring territories such as the west of north macedonia , the east of montenegro , kosovo in its entirety and southern serbia
in kosovo , albanians make up the largest ethnic group in the country
altogether , the number of ethnic albanian living abroad its territory is estimated to be higher than the total population inside the territory of albania

the etymology of the word allāh has been discussed extensively by classical arab philologists
encyclopedia of islam , 2nd ed , brill
grammarians of the basra school regarded it as either formed spontaneously ( murtajal ) or as the definite form of lāh ( from the verbal root lyh with the meaning of lofty or hidden )
others held that it was borrowed from syriac or hebrew , but most considered it to be derived from a contraction of the arabic definite article al - the and meaning the deity , or the god
the majority of modern scholars subscribe to the latter theory , and view the loanword hypothesis with skepticism
cognates of the name allāh exist in other semitic languages , including hebrew and aramaic
columbia encyclopaedia says derived from an old semitic root referring to the divine and used in the canaanite el , the mesopotamian ilu , and the biblical elohim and eloah , the word allah is used by all arabic - speaking muslims , christians , jews , and other monotheists

according to marshall hodgson , it seems that in the pre - islamic times , some arab christians made pilgrimage to the kaaba , a pagan temple at that time , honoring allah there as god the creator
some archaeological excavation quests have led to the discovery of ancient pre - islamic inscriptions and tombs made by arab christians in the ruins of a church at umm el - jimal in northern jordan , which initially , according to enno littman ( 1949 ) , contained references to allah as the proper name of god
however , on a second revision by bellamy and others ( 1985 1988 ) the 5 - versed - inscription was re - translated as ( 1 ) this inscription was set up by colleagues of ʿulayh , ( 2 ) son of ʿubaydah , secretary ( 3 ) of the cohort augusta secunda ( 4 ) philadelphiana ; may he go mad who ( 5 ) effaces it

in an inscription of christian martyrion dated back to 512 , references to l - ilah ( الاله ) can be found in both arabic and aramaic
the inscription starts with the statement by the help of l - ilah
in pre - islamic gospels , the name used for god was allah , as evidenced by some discovered arabic versions of the new testament written by arab christians during the pre - islamic era in northern and southern arabia
however most recent research in the field of islamic studies by sydney griffith and others ( 2013 ) , david grafton ( 2014 ) , clair wilde ( 2014 ) ml hjälm and others ( 2016 2017 ) assert that all one can say about the possibility of a pre - islamic , christian version of the gospel in arabic is that no sure sign of its actual existence has yet emerged
irfan shahîd quoting the 10th - century encyclopedic collection kitab al - aghani notes that pre - islamic arab christians have been reported to have raised the battle cry ya la ibad allah ( o slaves of allah ) to invoke each other into battle
according to shahid , on the authority of 10th - century muslim scholar al - marzubani , allah was also mentioned in pre - islamic christian poems by some ghassanid and tanukhid poets in syria and northern arabia
in islam , allah is the unique , omnipotent and only deity and creator of the universe and is equivalent to god in other abrahamic religions
allah is usually seen as the personal name of god , a notion which became disputed in contemporary scholarship , including the question , whether or not the word allah should be translated as god
according to islamic belief , allah is the most common word to represent god , böwering , gerhard , god and his attributes , encyclopaedia of the qurʼān , brill , 2007
and humble submission to his will , divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the muslim faith
he is the only god , creator of the universe , and the judge of humankind
he is unique ( ) , all - merciful and omnipotent
no human eyes can see allah till the day of judgement
god is not a part of the christian trinity
the concept correlates to the tawhid , where chapter 112 of the quran ( al - ikhlās , the sincerity ) reads
۝ and there is not any one like unto him
and in the ayat ul - kursi ( verse of the throne ) , which is the 255th verse and the powerful verse in the longest chapter ( the 2nd chapter ) of the quran , al - baqarah ( the cow ) states
in islamic tradition , there are 99 names of god ( all these names refer to allah , the supreme and all - comprehensive divine name
) , including the forementioned above al - aḥad ( the one , the indivisible ) and al - wāḥid ( the unique , the single )
most muslims use the untranslated arabic phrase ( meaning in the name of god )
there are certain phrases in praise of god that are favored by muslims , including ( praise be to god ) , ( god is the most great ) as a devotional exercise of remembering god ( dhikr )
in a sufi practice known as dhikr allah ( arabic ذكر الله , lit
remembrance of god ) , the sufi repeats and contemplates the name allah or other associated divine names to him while controlling his or her breath
for example , in countless references in the context from the quran forementioned above
1 ) allah is referred to in the second person pronoun in arabic as inta ( arabic َإِنْت ) like the english you , or commonly in the third person pronoun huwa ( arabic َهُو ) like the english he and uniquely in the case pronoun of the oblique form hu / huw ( arabic هو / - هُ ) like the english him which rhythmically resonates and is chanted as considered a sacred sound or echo referring allah as the absolute breath or soul of life - al - nafs al - hayyah ( arabic النّفس الحياة , an - nafsu l - ḥayyah ) - notably among the 99 names of god , the giver of life ( al - muḥyī ) and the bringer of death ( al - mumiyt ) ;
2 ) allah is neither male or female ( who has no gender ) , but who is the essence of the omnipotent , selfless , absolute soul ( an - nafs , النّفس ) and holy spirit ( ar - rūḥ , الرّوح ) - notably among the 99 names of god , the all - holy , all - pure and all - sacred ( al - quddus ) ;
3 ) allah is the originator of both before and beyond the cycle of creation , destruction and time , - notably among the 99 names of god , the first , beginning - less ( al - awwal ) , the end / beyond the final abode / endless ( al - akhir / al - ākhir ) and the timeless ( aṣ - ṣabūr )
according to gerhard böwering , in contrast with pre - islamic arabian polytheism , god in islam does not have associates and companions , nor is there any kinship between god and jinn
pre - islamic pagan arabs believed in a blind , powerful , inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control
this was replaced with the islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful god
according to francis edward peters , the qur’ān insists , muslims believe , and historians affirm that muhammad and his followers worship the same god as the jews
the qur’ans allah is the same creator god who covenanted with abraham
peters states that the quran portrays allah as both more powerful and more remote than yahweh , and as a universal deity , unlike yahweh who closely follows israelites

the word allāh is generally pronounced , a velarized alveolar lateral approximant , a marginal phoneme in modern standard arabic
since the initial alef has no hamza , the initial , the lām is light ,
the history of the name allāh in english was probably influenced by the study of comparative religion in the 19th century ; for example , thomas carlyle ( 1840 ) sometimes used the term allah but without any implication that allah was anything different from god
however , in his biography of muḥammad ( 1934 ) , tor andræ always used the term allah , though he allows that this conception of god seems to imply that it is different from that of the jewish and christian theologies
william montgomery watt , islam and christianity today a contribution to dialogue , routledge , 1983 , p
languages which may not commonly use the term allah to denote god may still contain popular expressions which use the word
for example , because of the centuries long muslim presence in the iberian peninsula , the word ojalá in the spanish language and oxalá in the portuguese language exist today , borrowed from arabic inshalla ( arabic إن شاء الله )
this phrase literally means if god wills ( in the sense of i hope so )
the german poet mahlmann used the form allah as the title of a poem about the ultimate deity , though it is unclear how much islamic thought he intended to convey
some muslims leave the name allāh untranslated in english , rather than using the english translation god
the word has also been applied to certain living human beings as personifications of the term and concept
christians in malaysia and indonesia use allah to refer to god in the malaysian and indonesian languages ( both of them standardized forms of the malay language )
mainstream bible translations in the language use allah as the translation of hebrew elohim ( translated in english bibles as god )
ruyl also translated the gospel of matthew in 1612 into the malay language ( an early bible translation into a non - european language ,
the government of malaysia in 2007 outlawed usage of the term allah in any other but muslim contexts , but the malayan high court in 2009 revoked the law , ruling it unconstitutional
while allah had been used for the christian god in malay for more than four centuries , the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of allah by the roman catholic newspaper the herald
the government appealed the court ruling , and the high court suspended implementation of its verdict until the hearing of the appeal
in october 2013 the court ruled in favor of the governments ban
however , the use of allah is not prohibited in the two malaysian states of sabah and sarawak
the main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long - established and local alkitab ( bibles ) have been widely distributed freely in east malaysia without restrictions for years
both states also do not have similar islamic state laws as those in west malaysia
in reaction to some media criticism , the malaysian government has introduced a 10 - point solution to avoid confusion and misleading information
the 10 - point solution is in line with the spirit of the 18 - and 20 - point agreements of sarawak and sabah
the word to spell the to spell is added on top of the to indicate the pronunciation
god is referred to by the term , that is , alif - lam - alif - lam - ha
this presumably indicates al - ilāh the god , without alif for ā
since arabic script is used to write other texts rather than koran only , rendering as the previous ligature is considered faulty which is the case with most common arabic typefaces
unicode has a code point reserved for ufdf2 , in the arabic presentation forms - a block , which exists solely for compatibility with some older , legacy character sets that encoded presentation forms directly ; this is discouraged for new text
instead , the word should be represented by its individual arabic letters , while modern font technologies will render the desired ligature
the calligraphic variant of the word used as the coat of arms of iran is encoded in unicode , in the miscellaneous symbols range , at code point u262b ( ☫ )

according to a modern etymology , the term azerbaijan derives from that of atropates , a persian satrap under the achaemenid empire , who was later reinstated as the satrap of media under alexander the great
nevertheless , despite being one of the chief vassals of sasanian shahanshah , the albanian king had only a semblance of authority , and the sassanid marzban ( military governor ) held most civil , religious , and military authority
, which literally translates from avestan as we worship the fravashi of the holy atropatene
the greek name was mentioned by diodorus siculus and strabo
over the span of millennia , the name evolved to , ( new persian ) and present - day azerbaijan
the name azerbaijan was first adopted for the area of the present - day republic of azerbaijan by the government of musavat in 1918 , on that basis iran protested the newly adopted country name
during the soviet rule , the country was also spelled in latin from the russian transliteration as )
the earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of azerbaijan dates back to the late stone age and is related to the guruchay culture of azykh cave
early settlements included the scythians during the 9th century bc
following the scythians , iranian medes came to dominate the area to the south of the aras river
the medes forged a vast empire between 900 and 700bc , which was integrated into the achaemenid empire around 550bc
the sasanian empire turned caucasian albania into a vassal state in 252 , while king urnayr officially adopted christianity as the state religion in the 4th century
in the first half of the 7th century , caucasian albania , as a vassal of the sasanians , came under nominal muslim rule due to the muslim conquest of persia
the umayyad caliphate repulsed both the sasanians and byzantines from the south caucasus and turned caucasian albania into a vassal state after christian resistance led by king javanshir , was suppressed in 667
the power vacuum left by the decline of the abbasid caliphate was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the sallarids , sajids , and shaddadids
at the beginning of the 11th century , the territory was gradually seized by the waves of oghuz turks from central asia , who adopted a turkoman ethnonym at the time
the first of these turkic dynasties established was the seljuk empire , which entered the area now known as azerbaijan by 1067
the pre - turkic population that lived on the territory of modern azerbaijan spoke several indo - european and caucasian languages , among them armenian

some linguists have also stated that the tati dialects of iranian azerbaijan and the republic of azerbaijan , like those spoken by the tats , are descended from old azeri
locally , the possessions of the subsequent seljuk empire were ruled by eldiguzids , technically vassals of the seljuk sultans , but sometimes de facto rulers themselves
under the seljuks , local poets such as nizami ganjavi and khaqani gave rise to a blossoming of persian literature on the territory of present - day azerbaijan
the local dynasty of the shirvanshahs became a vassal state of timurs empire and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the golden horde tokhtamysh
following timurs death , two independent and rival states emerged kara koyunlu and aq qoyunlu
the shirvanshahs returned , maintaining for numerous centuries to come a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals as they had done since 861
in 1501 , the safavid dynasty of iran subdued the shirvanshahs and gained its possessions
in the course of the next century , the safavids converted the formerly sunni population to shia islam ,
after the safavids , the area was ruled by the iranian afsharid dynasty
after the death of nader shah ( r
1736–1747 ) , many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability
numerous self - ruling khanates with various forms of autonomy
emerged in the area
the rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of iran and were vassals and subjects of the iranian shah
the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between central asia and the west
thereafter , the area was under the successive rule of the iranian zands and qajars
russia now actively tried to gain possession of the caucasus region which was , for the most part , in the hands of iran
following qajar irans loss in the 1804–1813 war , it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates , along with georgia and dagestan to the russian empire , per the treaty of gulistan

the area to the north of the river aras , amongst which territory lies the contemporary republic of azerbaijan , was iranian territory until russia occupied it in the 19th century
qajar iran was forced to cede its caucasian territories to russia in the 19th century , which thus included the territory of the modern - day azerbaijan republic , while as a result of that cession , the azerbaijani ethnic group is nowadays parted between two nations iran and azerbaijan
despite the russian conquest , throughout the entire 19th century , preoccupation with iranian culture , literature , and language remained widespread amongst shia and sunni intellectuals in the russian - held cities of baku , ganja and tiflis ( tbilisi , now georgia )
after the collapse of the russian empire during world war i , the short - lived transcaucasian democratic federative republic was declared , constituting the present - day republics of azerbaijan , georgia , and armenia
it was followed by the march days massacres that took place between 30 march and 2 april 1918 in the city of baku and adjacent areas of the baku governorate of the russian empire
among the important accomplishments of the parliament was the extension of suffrage to women , making azerbaijan the first muslim nation to grant women equal political rights with men
another important accomplishment of adr was the establishment of baku state university , which was the first modern - type university founded in the muslim east
by march 1920 , it was obvious that soviet russia would attack baku
vladimir lenin said that the invasion was justified as soviet russia could not survive without bakus oil
independent azerbaijan lasted only 23 months until the bolshevik 11th soviet red army invaded it , establishing the azerbaijan ssr on 28 april 1920
although the bulk of the newly formed azerbaijani army was engaged in putting down an armenian revolt that had just broken out in karabakh , azerbaijanis did not surrender their brief independence of 1918–20 quickly or easily
as many as 20 , 000 azerbaijani soldiers died resisting what was effectively a russian reconquest
within the ensuing early soviet period , the azerbaijani national identity was finally forged
on 13 october 1921 , the soviet republics of russia , armenia , azerbaijan , and georgia signed an agreement with turkey known as the treaty of kars
the previously independent republic of aras would also become the nakhchivan autonomous soviet socialist republic within the azerbaijan ssr by the treaty of kars
on the other hand , armenia was awarded the region of zangezur and turkey agreed to return gyumri ( then known as alexandropol )

following the politics of glasnost , initiated by mikhail gorbachev , civil unrest and ethnic strife grew in various regions of the soviet union , including nagorno - karabakh , later in 1990 , the supreme council of the azerbaijan ssr dropped the words soviet socialist from the title , adopted the declaration of sovereignty of the azerbaijan republic and restored the flag of the azerbaijan democratic republic as the state flag
the early years of independence were overshadowed by the first nagorno - karabakh war with the ethnic armenian majority of nagorno - karabakh backed by armenia
by the end of the hostilities in 1994 , armenians controlled up to 14–16 percent of azerbaijani territory , including nagorno - karabakh itself

azerbaijan has been harshly criticized for bribing foreign officials and diplomats to promote its causes abroad and legitimize its elections at home , a practice termed caviar diplomacy
however , on 6 march 2017 , esisc ( european strategic intelligence and security center ) published a report called the armenian connection , in which it attacked human rights ngos and research organisations criticising human rights violations and corruption in azerbaijan
esisc in that report asserted that the caviar diplomacy report elaborated by esi aimed to create a climate of suspicion based on slander to form a network of mps that would engage in a political war against azerbaijan and that the network , composed of european pms , armenian officials , and some ngos ( human rights watch , amnesty international , human rights house foundation , open dialog , european stability initiative , and helsinki committee for human rights ) was financed by the soros foundation
according to robert coalson ( radio free europe ) , esisc is a part of bakus lobbying efforts to extend the use of front think tanks to shift public opinion

the earliest known figure in azerbaijani literature was izzeddin hasanoglu , who composed a divan consisting of persian and turkic ghazals
caferoglu , adhari ( azeri ) , in encyclopedia of islam , ( new edition ) , vol
1 , ( leiden , 1986 ) in persian ghazals he used his pen - name , while his turkic ghazals were composed under his own name of hasanoghlu

the book of dede korkut consists of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century , michael meeker , the dede korkut ethic , international journal of middle east studies , vol
1992 ) , 395–417
excerpt the book of dede korkut is an early record of oral turkic folktales in anatolia , and as such , one of the mythic charters of turkish nationalist ideology
the oldest versions of the book of dede korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century
the twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among turkic peoples living in northeastern anatolia and northwestern azerbaijan
according to lewis ( 1974 ) , an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient oghuz and their turkish rivals in central asia ( the pecheneks and the kipchaks ) , but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th - century campaigns of the akkoyunlu confederation of turkic tribes against the georgians , the abkhaz , and the greeks in trebizond
such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century , and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century
by this time , the turkic peoples in question had been in touch with islamic civilization for several centuries , had come to call themselves turcoman rather than oghuz , had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies , and were participating in islamized regimes that included nomads , farmers , and townsmen
some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether
and was not written earlier than the 15th century
cemal kafadar ( 1995 ) , in between two worlds construction of the ottoman states , university of california press , 1995
excerpt it was not earlier than the fifteenth century
based on the fact that the author is buttering up both the akkoyunlu and ottoman rulers , it has been suggested that the composition belongs to someone living in the undefined border region lands between the two states during the reign of uzun hassan ( 1466–78 )
lewis , on the other hand , dates the composition fairly early in the 15th century at least

the film industry in azerbaijan dates back to 1898
in fact , azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in cinematography
after the soviet power was established in 1920 , nariman narimanov , chairman of the revolutionary committee of azerbaijan , signed a decree nationalizing azerbaijans cinema
this also influenced the creation of azerbaijani animation

in december 2000 , the former president of azerbaijan , heydar aliyev , signed a decree proclaiming 2 august to be the professional holiday of filmmakers of azerbaijan
today azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the soviet union in 1920
once again , both choices of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker

in 2012 , neftchi baku became the first azerbaijani team to advance to the group stage of a european competition , beating apoel of cyprus 4–2 on aggregate in the play - off round of the 2012–13 uefa europa league
in 2014 , qarabağ became the second azerbaijani club advancing to the group stage of uefa europa league
in 2017 , after beating copenhagen 2–2 ( a ) in the play - off round of the uefa champions league , qarabağ became the first azerbaijani club to reach the group stage
azerbaijan was the main sponsor of spanish football club atlético de madrid during seasons 2013 / 2014 and 2014 / 2015 , a partnership that the club described should promote the image of azerbaijan in the world
azerbaijan is one of the traditional powerhouses of world chess , notable chess players from the countrys chess schools that have made a great impact on the game include teimour radjabov , shahriyar mammadyarov , vladimir makogonov , vugar gashimov and former world chess champion garry kasparov
backgammon also plays a major role in azerbaijani culture
there are also different variations of backgammon developed and analyzed by azerbaijani experts
azerbaijan womens volleyball super league is one of the strongest women leagues in the world

amateur astronomy is a hobby where participants enjoy observing or imaging celestial objects in the sky using the unaided eye , binoculars , or telescopes
even though scientific research may not be their primary goal , some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing citizen science , such as by monitoring variable stars , cite web
amateur astronomers do not use the field of astronomy as their primary source of income or support , and usually have no professional degree in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject
most amateurs are hobbyists , while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist and work alongside professional astronomers
cite web
amateur astronomers typically view the sky at night , when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible , but others observe during the daytime by viewing the sun and solar eclipses
some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or binoculars , but more dedicated amateurs often use portable telescopes or telescopes situated in their private or club observatories
amateurs can also join as members of amateur astronomical societies , which can advise , educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects
they can also promote the science of astronomy among the general public
collectively , amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena
common targets of amateur astronomers include the sun , the moon , planets , stars , comets , meteor showers , and a variety of deep sky objects such as star clusters , galaxies , and nebulae
many amateurs like to specialise in observing particular objects , types of objects , or types of events which interest them
one branch of amateur astronomy , amateur astrophotography , involves the taking of photos of the night sky
astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including , digital cameras , dslr cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built high quality ccd cameras
most amateur astronomers work at visible wavelengths , but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum
an early pioneer of radio astronomy was grote reber , an amateur astronomer who constructed the first purpose built radio telescope in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of radio wavelength emissions from space by karl jansky
non - visual amateur astronomy includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes , and also the use of radio telescopes
some amateur astronomers use home - made radio telescopes , while others use radio telescopes that were originally built for astronomical research but have since been made available for use by amateurs
the one - mile telescope is one such example
amateur astronomers use a range of instruments to study the sky , depending on a combination of their interests and resources
methods include simply looking at the night sky with the naked eye , using binoculars , and using a variety of optical telescopes of varying power and quality , as well as additional sophisticated equipment , such as cameras , to study light from the sky in both the visual and non - visual parts of the spectrum
commercial telescopes are available , new and used , but it is also common for amateur astronomers to build ( or commission the building of ) their own custom telescopes
some people even focus on amateur telescope making as their primary interest within the hobby of amateur astronomy
although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over time , relatively simple equipment is often preferred for certain tasks
binoculars , for instance , although generally of lower power than the majority of telescopes , also tend to provide a wider field of view , which is preferable for looking at some objects in the night sky
amateur astronomers also use star charts that , depending on experience and intentions , may range from simple planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night sky
a range of astronomy software is available and used by amateur astronomers , including software that generates maps of the sky , software to assist with astrophotography , observation scheduling software , and software to perform various calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena
amateur astronomers often like to keep records of their observations , which usually takes the form of an observing log
observing logs typically record details about which objects were observed and when , as well as describing the details that were seen
sketching is sometimes used within logs , and photographic records of observations have also been used in recent times
the information gathered is used to help studies and interactions between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings
although not professional information or credible , it is a way for the hobby lovers to share their new sightings and experiences
the popularity of imaging among amateurs has led to large numbers of web sites being written by individuals about their images and equipment
much of the social interaction of amateur astronomy occurs on mailing lists or discussion groups
discussion group servers host numerous astronomy lists
a great deal of the commerce of amateur astronomy , the buying and selling of equipment , occurs online
many amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions , using tools such as the clear sky chart
while a number of interesting celestial objects are readily identified by the naked eye , sometimes with the aid of a star chart , many others are so faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them
although many methods are used in amateur astronomy , most are variations of a few specific techniques
star hopping is a method often used by amateur astronomers with low - tech equipment such as binoculars or a manually driven telescope
it involves the use of maps ( or memory ) to locate known landmark stars , and hopping between them , often with the aid of a finderscope
because of its simplicity , star hopping is a very common method for finding objects that are close to naked - eye stars
more advanced methods of locating objects in the sky include telescope mounts with setting circles , which assist with pointing telescopes to positions in the sky that are known to contain objects of interest , and goto telescopes , which are fully automated telescopes that are capable of locating objects on demand ( having first been calibrated )
the advent of mobile applications for use in smartphones has led to the creation of many dedicated apps
these apps allow any user to easily locate celestial objects of interest by simply pointing the smartphone device in that direction in the sky
these apps make use of the inbuilt hardware in the phone , such as gps location and gyroscope
useful information about the pointed object like celestial coordinates , the name of the object , its constellation , etcetera are provided for a quick reference
some paid versions give more information
these apps are gradually getting into regular use during observing , for the alignment process of telescopes
setting circles are angular measurement scales that can be placed on the two main rotation axes of some telescopes
since the widespread adoption of digital setting circles , any classical engraved setting circle is now specifically identified as an analog setting circle ( asc )
by knowing the coordinates of an object ( usually given in equatorial coordinates ) , the telescope user can use the setting circle to align ( that is , point ) the telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its eyepiece
a computerized setting circle is called a digital setting circle ( dsc )
although digital setting circles can be used to display a telescopes ra and dec coordinates , they are not simply a digital read - out of what can be seen on the telescopes analog setting circles
as with go - to telescopes , digital setting circle computers ( commercial names include argo navis , sky commander , and ngc max ) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial objects and projections of planet positions
to find a celestial object in a telescope equipped with a dsc computer , one does not need to look up the specific ra and dec coordinates in a book or other resource , and then adjust the telescope to those numerical readings
rather , the object is chosen from the electronic database , which causes distance values and arrow markers to appear in the display that indicate the distance and direction to move the telescope
the telescope is moved until the two angular distance values reach zero , indicating that the telescope is properly aligned
when both the ra and dec axes are thus zeroed out , the object should be in the eyepiece
many dscs , like go - to systems , can also work in conjunction with laptop sky programs
computerized systems provide the further advantage of computing coordinate precession
traditional printed sources are subtitled by the epoch year , which refers to the positions of celestial objects at a given time to the nearest year ( for example , j2005 , j2007 )
most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years ( for example , j1900 , j1950 , j2000 )
computerized sources , on the other hand , are able to calculate the right ascension and declination of the epoch of date to the exact instant of observation
goto telescopes have become more popular since the 1980s as technology has improved and prices have been reduced
with these computer - driven telescopes , the user typically enters the name of the item of interest and the mechanics of the telescope point the telescope towards that item automatically
they have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on research
for example , goto telescopes tend to be faster for locating items of interest than star hopping , allowing more time for studying of the object
goto also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt - azimuth telescope mounts , allowing them to produce an overall less expensive product
goto telescopes usually have to be calibrated using alignment stars in order to provide accurate tracking and positioning
however , several telescope manufacturers have recently developed telescope systems that are calibrated with the use of built - in gps , decreasing the time it takes to set up a telescope at the start of an observing session
with the development of fast internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in computer controlled telescope mounts and ccd cameras remote telescope astronomy is now a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with major telescope facilities to partake in research and deep sky imaging
this enables anyone to control a telescope a great distance away in a dark location
the observer can image through the telescope using ccd cameras
the digital data collected by the telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the user by means of the internet
an example of a digital remote telescope operation for public use via the internet is the bareket observatory , and there are telescope farms in new mexico ,
amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including film , dslr , lrgb , and ccd astrophotography
because ccd imagers are linear , image processing may be used to subtract away the effects of light pollution , which has increased the popularity of astrophotography in urban areas
narrowband filters may also be used to minimize light pollution
scientific research is most often not the main goal for many amateur astronomers , unlike professional astronomers
work of scientific merit is possible , however , and many amateurs successfully contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers
astronomy is sometimes promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data
to recognize this , the astronomical society of the pacific annually gives amateur achievement awards for significant contributions to astronomy by amateurs
the majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection
in particular , this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers
several organizations , such as the american association of variable star observers and the british astronomical association , exist to help coordinate these contributions
amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of variable stars and supernovae , helping to track asteroids , and observing occultations to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the moon as seen from earth
with more advanced equipment , but still cheap in comparison to professional setups , amateur astronomers can measure the light spectrum emitted from astronomical objects , which can yield high - quality scientific data if the measurements are performed with due care
a relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked phenomena ( for example , kreutz sungrazers ) in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by earth and space based observatories , much of which is available over the internet
in the past and present , amateur astronomers have played a major role in discovering new comets
recently however , funding of projects such as the lincoln near - earth asteroid research and near earth asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by automated systems long before it is possible for amateurs to see them
there are a large number of amateur astronomical societies around the world , that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy
members range from active observers with their own equipment to armchair astronomers who are simply interested in the topic
societies range widely in their goals and activities , which may depend on a variety of factors such as geographic spread , local circumstances , size , and membership
for example , a small local society located in dark countryside may focus on practical observing and star parties , whereas a large one based in a major city might have numerous members but be limited by light pollution and thus hold regular indoor meetings with guest speakers instead
major national or international societies generally publish their own journal or newsletter , and some hold large multi - day meetings akin to a scientific conference or convention
they may also have sections devoted to particular topics , such as lunar observation or amateur telescope making
aikido ( , , ) is a modern japanese martial art that is split into many different styles , including iwama ryu , iwama shin shin aiki shuren kai , shodokan aikido , yoshinkan , renshinkai , aikikai and ki aikido
aikido is now practiced in around 140 countries
it was originally developed by morihei ueshiba , as a synthesis of his martial studies , philosophy and religious beliefs
ueshibas goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attackers from injury
aikido is often translated as the way of unifying ( with ) life energycite book
aikidos fundamental principles include ( entering ) , ( breathing control ) , ( turning ) movements that redirect the opponents attack momentum
its curriculum comprises various techniques , primarily throws and joint locks
cite encyclopedia
aikido derives mainly from the martial art of daitō - ryū aiki - jūjutsu , but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s , partly due to ueshibas involvement with the ōmoto - kyō religion
ueshibas early students documents bear the term
cite encyclopedia
ueshibas senior students have different approaches to aikido , depending partly on when they studied with him
today , aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles , with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis
however , they all share techniques formulated by ueshiba and most have concern for the well - being of the attacker
the term does not readily appear in the japanese language outside the scope of budō
this has led to many possible interpretations of the word
) is mainly used in compounds to mean combine , unite , join together , meet , examples being ( composition ) , ( union / alliance / association ) , ( mutual agreement )
there is an idea of reciprocity , ( talk / discussion / negotiation ) , and ( meet by appointment )
) is often used to describe a feeling or emotive action , as in ( feeling / sensation ) ; it is used to mean energy or force , as in ( magnetism ) ; it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things , as in that is used extensively in traditional chinese medicine and acupunture
therefore , from a purely literal interpretation , aikido is the way of combining forces or way of unifying energy , in which the term refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attackers movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort

by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter - technique
ueshiba envisioned aikido not only as the synthesis of his martial training , but as an expression of his personal philosophy of universal peace and reconciliation
during ueshibas lifetime and continuing today , aikido has evolved from the that ueshiba studied into a variety of expressions by martial artists throughout the world
ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied

ueshiba moved to hokkaidō in 1912 , and began studying under takeda sokaku in 1915 ; his official association with daitō - ryū continued until 1937
however , during the latter part of that period , ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from takeda and the ) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of japanese martial arts
after ueshiba left hokkaidō in 1919 , he met and was profoundly influenced by onisaburo deguchi , the spiritual leader of the ōmoto - kyō religion ( a neo - shinto movement ) in ayabe
cite encyclopedia
one of the primary features of ōmoto - kyō is its emphasis on the attainment of utopia during ones life
this idea was a great influence on ueshibas martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others
aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it
in an ideal resolution , not only is the receiver unharmed , but so is the attacker
cite web
in addition to the effect on his spiritual growth , the connection with deguchi gave ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist
as a result of this exposure , he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students
several of these students would found their own styles of aikido

aikido was first introduced to the rest of the world in 1951 by minoru mochizuki with a visit to france , where he demonstrated aikido techniques to judo students
cite encyclopedia
later that year , koichi tohei was sent by aikikai hombu to hawaii for a full year , where he set up several dōjō
this trip was followed by several subsequent visits and is considered the formal introduction of aikido to the united states
the united kingdom followed in 1955 ; italy in 1964 by hiroshi tada ; and germany in 1965 by katsuaki asai
designated the official delegate for europe and africa by morihei ueshiba , masamichi noro arrived in france in september 1961
seiichi sugano was appointed to introduce aikido to australia in 1965
today there are aikido dōjō throughout the world
the largest aikido organization is the aikikai foundation , which remains under the control of the ueshiba family
however , aikido has developed into many styles , most of which were formed by morihei ueshibas major students
the earliest independent styles to emerge were yoseikan aikido , begun by minoru mochizuki in 1931 , yoshinkan aikido , founded by gozo shioda in 1955 , cite encyclopedia
the emergence of these styles pre - dated ueshibas death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized
shodokan aikido , however , was controversial , since it introduced a unique rule - based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido
after ueshibas death in 1969 , two more major styles emerged
significant controversy arose with the departure of the aikikai hombu dojos chief instructor koichi tohei , in 1974
tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder , kisshomaru ueshiba , who at that time headed the aikikai foundation
the disagreement was over the proper role of )

a final major style evolved from ueshibas retirement in iwama , ibaraki and the teaching methodology of long term student morihiro saito
it is unofficially referred to as the iwama style , and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called iwama ryu
although iwama style practitioners remained part of the aikikai until saitos death in 2002 , followers of saito subsequently split into two groups
one remained with the aikikai and the other formed the independent shinshin aikishuren kai in 2004 around saitos son hitohiro saito
today , the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization , have their own in japan , and are taught throughout the world

in aikido , as in virtually all japanese martial arts , there are both physical and mental aspects of training
the physical training in aikido is diverse , covering both general physical fitness and conditioning , as well as specific techniques
cite book
because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of throws , beginners learn how to safely fall or roll
the specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs ; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins
after basic techniques are learned , students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents , and techniques with weapons
physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation , correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders , flexibility , and endurance , with less emphasis on strength training
in aikido , pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements
this distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner
in aikido , specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone , mass , or power
aikido - related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole - body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates
for example , many dōjōs begin each class with ( break falls )
aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre - arranged forms to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the ( depending on aikido style ) , also referred to as ( when applying a throwing technique ) , who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique

the method of falling itself is also important , and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury
aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack , so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner
although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking - based arts , attacks with intent ( such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab ) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique
many of the ) , are practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword
kicks are generally reserved for upper - level variations ; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous , and that kicks ( high kicks in particular ) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal japan
beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs , both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike
some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon , whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender
the following are examples of some basic grabs
the following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins
many of these techniques derive from daitō - ryū aiki - jūjutsu , but some others were invented by morihei ueshiba

aikido styles vary in their intention as due to its holistic nature

stanley pranin has observed that some criticism may stem from weak attacks from , resulting in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners
to counteract this , some styles allow students to become less compliant over time , but , in keeping with the core philosophies , this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners
shodokan aikido addresses the issue by practicing in a competitive format
such adaptations are debated between styles , with some maintaining that there is no need to adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified , or that they are not training for self - defense or combat effectiveness , but spiritual , fitness or other reasons
reasons for the difference and diversity of teachings , intention , and forms of aikido can be traced to the shift in training focus after the end of ueshibas seclusion in iwama from 1942 to the mid - 1950s , as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido
as a result , strikes to vital points by ) and initiation of techniques by ( front side ) and
conversely , some styles of aikido place less importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by ueshiba
according to minoru shibata of aikido journal
o - senseis aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts
in other words , aikido practitioners who focus on aikidos roots in traditional are said to be diverging from what ueshiba taught , as some critics urge practitioners
ueshibas transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals of the paradigm that he demonstrated
art is a diverse range of human activity , and resulting product , that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency , beauty , emotional power , or conceptual ideas
there is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art , theatre , dance , and other performing arts , as well as literature , music , film and other media such as interactive media , are included in a broader definition of the arts
until the 17th century , art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences
in modern usage after the 17th century , where aesthetic considerations are paramount , the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general , such as the decorative or applied arts
the nature of art and related concepts , such as creativity and interpretation , are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics
the resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art
in the perspective of the history of art , one early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older latin meaning , which roughly translates to skill or craft , as associated with words such as artisan
english words derived from this meaning include artifact , artificial , artifice , medical arts , and military arts
however , there are many other colloquial uses of the word , all with some relation to its etymology
over time , philosophers like plato , aristotle , socrates and kant , among others , questioned the meaning of art
with regards to the literary art and the musical arts , aristotle considered epic poetry , tragedy , comedy , dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art , each varying in imitation by medium , object , and manner
the more recent and specific sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century
fine art refers to a skill used to express the artists creativity , or to engage the audiences aesthetic sensibilities , or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer work of art
within this latter sense , the word art may refer to several things ( i ) a study of a creative skill , ( ii ) a process of using the creative skill , ( iii ) a product of the creative skill , or ( iv ) the audiences experience with the creative skill
the creative arts ( art as discipline ) are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks ( art as objects ) that are compelled by a personal drive ( art as activity ) and convey a message , mood , or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret ( art as experience )
art is something that stimulates an individuals thoughts , emotions , beliefs , or ideas through the senses
works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects
for some scholars , such as kant , the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression
often , if the skill is being used in a common or practical way , people will consider it a craft instead of art
likewise , if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way , it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art
on the other hand , crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art
some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference
however , even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self - expression
the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas , such as in politically , spiritually , or philosophically motivated art ; to create a sense of beauty ( see aesthetics ) ; to explore the nature of perception ; for pleasure ; or to generate strong emotions
the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent
the nature of art has been described by philosopher richard wollheim as one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture
benedetto croce and collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions , and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator
larry shiner has described fine art as not an essence or a fate but something we have made
art as we have generally understood it is a european invention barely two hundred years old
art may be characterized in terms of mimesis ( its representation of reality ) , narrative ( storytelling ) , expression , communication of emotion , or other qualities
during the romantic period , art came to be seen as a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science
a shell engraved by homo erectus was determined to be between 430 , 000 and 540 , 000 years old
a series of tiny , drilled snail shells about 75 , 000 years old—were discovered in a south african cave
sculptures , cave paintings , rock paintings and petroglyphs from the upper paleolithic dating to roughly 40 , 000 years ago have been found , but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them
many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations ancient egypt , mesopotamia , persia , india , china , ancient greece , rome , as well as inca , maya , and olmec
each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art
because of the size and duration of these civilizations , more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times
some also have provided the first records of how artists worked
for example , this period of greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature , poise , beauty , and anatomically correct proportions
in byzantine and medieval art of the western middle ages , much art focused on the expression of subjects about biblical and religious culture , and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world , such as the use of gold in the background of paintings , or glass in mosaics or windows , which also presented figures in idealized , patterned ( flat ) forms nevertheless , a classical realist tradition persisted in small byzantine works , and realism steadily grew in the art of catholic europe
renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world , and the place of humans in it , reflected in the corporeality of the human body , and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three - dimensional picture space
in the east , islamic arts rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns , calligraphy , and architecture
further east , religion dominated artistic styles and forms too
india and tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance , while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines
china saw the flourishing of many art forms jade carving , bronzework , pottery ( including the stunning terracotta army of emperor qin ) , poetry , calligraphy , music , painting , drama , fiction , etcetera chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty
so , for example , tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse , emphasizing idealized landscapes , but ming dynasty paintings are busy and colorful , and focus on telling stories via setting and composition
japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too , and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting
woodblock printing became important in japan after the 17th century
the western age of enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe , as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post - monarchist world , such as blakes portrayal of newton as a divine geometer ,
the history of 20th - century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards , each being torn down in succession by the next
thus the parameters of impressionism , expressionism , fauvism , cubism , dadaism , surrealism , etcetera cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention
increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into western art
thus , japanese woodblock prints ( themselves influenced by western renaissance draftsmanship ) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development
later , african sculptures were taken up by picasso and to some extent by matisse
similarly , in the 19th and 20th centuries the west has had huge impacts on eastern art with originally western ideas like communism and post - modernism exerting a powerful influence
modernism , the idealistic search for truth , gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability
theodor adorno said in 1970 , it is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more neither art itself , nor art in relationship to the whole , nor even the right of art to exist
relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth , which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism , where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms , which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony
furthermore , the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture , rather than of regional ones
in the origin of the work of art , martin heidegger , a german philosopher and a seminal thinker , describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth
he argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture , but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which that which is can be revealed
works of art are not merely representations of the way things are , but actually produce a communitys shared understanding
each time a new artwork is added to any culture , the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed
historically , art and artistic skills and ideas have often been spread through trade
an example of this is the silk road , where hellenistic , iranian , indian and chinese influences could mix
greco buddhist art is one of the most vivid examples of this interaction
the meeting of different cultures and worldviews also influenced artistic creation
an example of this is the multicultural port metropolis of trieste at the beginning of the 20th century , where james joyce met writers from central europe and the artistic development of new york city as a cultural melting pot
the creative arts are often divided into more specific categories , typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media , genre , styles , and form
such as color , contour , dimension , medium , melody , space , texture , and value
form may also include visual design principles , such as arrangement , balance , contrast , emphasis , harmony , proportion , proximity , and rhythm
in general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art , focusing respectively on form , content , and context
extreme formalism is the view that all aesthetic properties of art are formal ( that is , part of the art form )
philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials , techniques , and form
unfortunately , there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties
some authors refer to subject matter and content – that is , denotations and connotations – while others prefer terms like meaning and significance
extreme intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art , conveying the content or essential main idea , while all other interpretations can be discarded
and the content as the artists experience of that subject
for example , the composition of napoleon i on his imperial throne is partly borrowed from the statue of zeus at olympia
as evidenced by the title , the subject is napoleon , and the content is ingress representation of napoleon as emperor - god beyond time and space
similarly to extreme formalism , philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism , because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant
its restrictive interpretation is socially unhealthy , philosophically unreal , and politically unwise
finally , the developing theory of post - structuralism studies arts significance in a cultural context , such as the ideas , emotions , and reactions prompted by a work
the cultural context often reduces to the artists techniques and intentions , in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism
however , in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate , such as religious and philosophical convictions , sociopolitical and economic structures , or even climate and geography
art criticism continues to grow and develop alongside art
art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium
art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy or depth
art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings , thoughts , and observations
there is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it , which facilitates ones thought processes
a common view is that the epithet art , particular in its elevated sense , requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist , whether this be a demonstration of technical ability , an originality in stylistic approach , or a combination of these two
traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success ; for leonardo da vinci , art , neither more nor less than his other endeavors , was a manifestation of skill
at the turn of the 20th century , the adroit performances of john singer sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency ,
a common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object
in conceptual art , marcel duchamps fountain is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ( ready - made ) and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills
the actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects
however , there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands - on works of art
art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history , making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept
this does not imply that the purpose of art is vague , but that it has had many unique , different reasons for being created
some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline
the different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non - motivated , and those that are motivated ( lévi - strauss )
the non - motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human , transcend the individual , or do not fulfill a specific external purpose
in this sense , art , as creativity , is something humans must do by their very nature ( that is , no other species creates art ) , and is therefore beyond utility
motivated purposes of art refer to intentional , conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator
these may be to bring about political change , to comment on an aspect of society , to convey a specific emotion or mood , to address personal psychology , to illustrate another discipline , to ( with commercial arts ) sell a product , or simply as a form of communication
the functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive , as many of them may overlap
for example , art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product , that is the movie or video game
since ancient times , much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power , often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials
much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments , with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society
nevertheless , there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available , in terms of ownership , across large parts of society , above all in cheap media such as pottery , which persists in the ground , and perishable media such as textiles and wood
in many different cultures , the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the americas are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a social elite , once coins were widely used , these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society
another important innovation came in the 15th century in europe , when printmaking began with small woodcuts , mostly religious , that were often very small and hand - colored , and affordable even by peasants who glued them to the walls of their homes
printed books were initially very expensive , but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations
in 1661 , the city of basel , in switzerland , opened the first public museum of art in the world , the kunstmuseum basel
today , its collection is distinguished by an impressively wide historic span , from the early 15th century up to the immediate present
its various areas of emphasis give it international standing as one of the most significant museums of its kind
these encompass paintings and drawings by artists active in the upper rhine region between 1400 and 1600 , and on the art of the 19th to 21st centuries
public buildings and monuments , secular and religious , by their nature normally address the whole of society , and visitors as viewers , and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design
egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public , rather than the areas seen only by the priests
special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries , as with the orleans collection mostly housed in a wing of the palais royal in paris , which could be visited for most of the 18th century
the building now occupied by the prado in madrid was built before the french revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection , and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in vienna , munich and other capitals
the opening of the musée du louvre during the french revolution ( in 1793 ) as a public museum for much of the former french royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art , transferring ownership to a republican state , but was a continuation of trends already well established
most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone
however , museums do not only provide availability to art , but do also influence the way art is being perceived by the audience , as studies found
thus , the museum itself is not only a blunt stage for the presentation of art , but plays an active and vital role in the overall perception of art in modern society
museums in the united states tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses
( the metropolitan museum of art in new york city , for example , was created by john taylor johnston , a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum
) but despite all this , at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status
there have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object
one of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold
it is necessary to present something more than mere objects said the major post war german artist joseph beuys
this time period saw the rise of such things as performance art , video art , and conceptual art
the idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind , or was simply an idea , it could not be bought and sold
democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid - 1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s
artists broadly identified under the heading of conceptual art substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form have endeavored to undermine the art object qua object
art has long been controversial , that is to say disliked by some viewers , for a wide variety of reasons , though most pre - modern controversies are dimly recorded , or completely lost to a modern view
iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons , including religious ones
aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images , or often just religious ones , and has been a thread in many major religions
it has been a crucial factor in the history of islamic art , where depictions of muhammad remain especially controversial
much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers , parties or other groups
artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics , though often much less so by a wider public
the iconographic content of art could cause controversy , as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the swoon of the virgin in scenes of the crucifixion of jesus
the last judgment by michelangelo was controversial for various reasons , including breaches of decorum through nudity and the apollo - like pose of christ
the content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist , but with the advent of romanticism , and economic changes in the production of art , the artists vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art , increasing the incidence of controversies , though often reducing their significance
strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy
théodore géricaults raft of the medusa ( c
1820 ) , was in part a political commentary on a recent event
édouard manets le déjeuner sur lherbe ( 1863 ) , was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman , but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time , rather than in robes of the antique world
john singer sargents madame pierre gautreau ( madamx ) ( 1884 ) , caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the womans ear lobe , considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high - society models reputation
the gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century
in the 20th century , pablo picassos guernica ( 1937 ) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils , to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small , ancient basque town
leon golubs interrogation iii ( 1981 ) , depicts a female nude , hooded detainee strapped to a chair , her legs open to reveal her sexual organs , surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing
andres serranos piss christ ( 1989 ) is a photograph of a crucifix , sacred to the christian religion and representing christs sacrifice and final suffering , submerged in a glass of the artists own urine
the resulting uproar led to comments in the united states senate about public funding of the arts
before modernism , aesthetics in western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of realism or truth to nature and the ideal ; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries
this concern is largely absent in other traditions of art
the aesthetic theorist john ruskin , who championed what he saw as the naturalism of turner , saw arts role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature
the definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century
richard wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art the realist , whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view ; the objectivist , whereby it is also an absolute value , but is dependent on general human experience ; and the relativist position , whereby it is not an absolute value , but depends on , and varies with , the human experience of different humans
the arrival of modernism in the late 19th century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art , and then again in the late 20th century with the advent of postmodernism
clement greenbergs 1960 article modernist painting defines modern art as the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself
modern art and modernism a critical anthology
francis frascina and charles harrison , 1982
greenberg originally applied this idea to the abstract expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat ( non - illusionistic ) abstract painting
pop artists like andy warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture , as well as the art world
artists of the 1980s , 1990s , and 2000s expanded this technique of self - criticism beyond high art to all cultural image - making , including fashion images , comics , billboards and pornography
duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind - everything
however , the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction
there is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this
in the invention of art a cultural history , larry shiner examines the construction of the modern system of the arts , that is fine art
he finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system ( fine art ) held art to be any skilled human activity ; for example , ancient greek society did not possess the term art , but techne
techne can be understood neither as art or craft , the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history
techne included painting , sculpting and music , but also cooking , medicine , horsemanship , geometry , carpentry , prophecy , and farming , etcetera
following duchamp during the first half of the 20th century , a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art , including the literary arts and the visual arts , to each other
this resulted in the rise of the new criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy
at issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art , whatever its specific form , should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art , or , if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist
in 1946 , william wimsatt and monroe beardsley published a classic and controversial new critical essay entitled the intentional fallacy , in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an authors intention , or intended meaning in the analysis of a literary work
for wimsatt and beardsley , the words on the page were all that mattered ; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant , and potentially distracting
in another essay , the affective fallacy , which served as a kind of sister essay to the intentional fallacy wimsatt and beardsley also discounted the readers personal / emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text
this fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader - response school of literary theory
ironically , one of the leading theorists from this school , stanley fish , was himself trained by new critics
fish criticizes wimsatt and beardsley in his 1970 essay literature in the reader
as summarized by gaut and livingston in their essay the creation of art structuralist and post - structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of new criticism , beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so - called autonomy of art , but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms assumption that the artists activities and experience were a privileged critical topic
these authors contend that anti - intentionalists , such as formalists , hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art
so details of the act of creating a work , though possibly of interest in themselves , have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work
gaut and livingston , p
gaut and livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that intentionalists , unlike formalists , hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works
they quote richard wollheim as stating that , the task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process , where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of , but terminating on , the work of art itself
the end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy , or the innocent eye debate in the philosophy of art
this debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art
decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition , namely the structuralism of ferdinand de saussure and the ensuing movement of poststructuralism
in 1981 , the artist mark tansey created a work of art titled the innocent eye as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century
influential theorists include judith butler , luce irigaray , julia kristeva , michel foucault and jacques derrida
the power of language , more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes , in art history and historical discourse was explored by hayden white
the fact that language is not a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of philosophy of language which originated in the works of johann georg hamann and wilhelm von humboldt
ernst gombrich and nelson goodman in his book languages of art an approach to a theory of symbols came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s
he was challenged on the basis of research done by the nobel prize winning psychologist roger sperry who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone ( the linguistic turn ) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable
sperrys view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as nick zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives

architecture is often included as one of the visual arts ; however , like the decorative arts , or advertising , it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting , for example
somewhat in relation to the above , the word art is also used to apply judgments of value , as in such expressions as that meal was a work of art ( the cook is an artist ) ,
the assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing
indeed , the reverse is often true , that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re - invigoration of aesthetic sensibility , and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself
countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality , yet they all seem to agree in at least one point once their aesthetic choices are accepted , the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist
art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion
it can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings , and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings
artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent , but they do not have to do so consciously
art may be considered an exploration of the human condition ; that is , what it is to be human
an essential legal issue are art forgeries , plagiarism , replicas and works that are strongly based on other works of art
the trade in works of art or the export from a country may be subject to legal regulations
internationally there are also extensive efforts to protect the works of art created
the un , unesco and blue shield international try to ensure effective protection at the national level and to intervene directly in the event of armed conflicts or disasters
this can particularly affect museums , archives ,
art collections and excavation sites
this should also secure the economic basis of a country , especially because works of art are often of tourist importance
the founding president of blue shield international , karl von habsburg , explained an additional connection between the destruction of cultural property and the cause of flight during a mission in lebanon in april 2019 “cultural goods are part of the identity of the people who live in a certain place
if you destroy their culture , you also destroy their identity
many people are uprooted , often no longer have any prospects and as a result flee from their homeland
agnostida is an order of arthropod which first developed near the end of the early cambrian period and thrived during the middle cambrian
they are present in the lower cambrian fossil record along with trilobites from the redlichiida , corynexochida , and ptychopariida orders
the last agnostids went extinct in the late ordovician
