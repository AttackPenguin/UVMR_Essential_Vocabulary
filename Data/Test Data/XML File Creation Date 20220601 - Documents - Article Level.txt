*********** Article 1: Anarchism ***********

anarchism is a political philosophy and movement that is sceptical of authority and rejects all involuntary , coercive forms of hierarchy . anarchism calls for the abolition of the state , which it holds to be unnecessary , undesirable , and harmful . as a historically left - wing movement , placed on the farthest left of the political spectrum , it is usually described alongside communalism and libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing ( libertarian socialism ) of the socialist movement , and has a strong historical association with anti - capitalism and socialism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break humans lived in societies without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of formal states , realms , or empires . with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies , scepticism toward authority also rose . although traces of anarchist thought are found throughout history , modern anarchism emerged from the enlightenment . during the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century , the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers ' struggles for emancipation . various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period . anarchists have taken part in several revolutions , most notably in the paris commune , the russian civil war and the spanish civil war , whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism . in the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century , the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics ; there is significant overlap between the two , which are merely descriptive . revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state , having taken a violent turn in the past , while evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like . anarchist thought , criticism , and praxis have played a part in diverse areas of human society . criticism of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent , violent , or utopian . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia , meaning " without a ruler " , composed of the prefix an - ( " without " ) and the word arkhos ( " leader " or " ruler " ) . the suffix - ism denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy . anarchism appears in english from 1642 as anarchisme and anarchy from 1539 ; early english usages emphasised a sense of disorder . various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists , although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists . many revolutionaries of the 19th century such as william godwin ( 1756–1836 ) and wilhelm weitling ( 1808–1871 ) would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre - joseph proudhon ( 1809–1865 ) , marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid - 19th century . since the 1890s and beginning in france , libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states . some usages of libertarianism refer to individualistic free - market philosophy only , and free - market anarchism in particular is termed libertarian anarchism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism , its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups , including both the new left and libertarian marxists , who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party , and extreme cultural liberals , who are primarily concerned with civil liberties . additionally , some anarchists use libertarian socialist to avoid anarchisms negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism . anarchism is broadly used to describe the anti - authoritarian wing of the socialist movement . anarchist historian daniel guérin described it as a synonym for libertarian socialism , and wrote that anarchism " is really a synonym for socialism . the anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man . anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought , that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the state . " in his many works on anarchism , such as chomsky on anarchism ( 2005 ) , historian noam chomsky describes anarchism , alongside libertarian marxism , as the libertarian wing of socialism . anarchism is contrasted to socialist forms which are state - oriented or from above . scholars of anarchism generally highlight anarchisms socialist credentials and criticise attempts at creating dichotomies between the two . some scholars describe anarchism as having many influences from liberalism , and being both liberals and socialists but more so , while most scholars reject anarcho - capitalism as a misunderstanding of anarchist principles . peter marshall states that " in general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism . anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp , but it also has outriders in liberalism . it cannot be reduced to socialism , and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine . " according to jeremy jennings , " it is hard not to conclude that these ideas " , referring to anarcho - capitalism , " are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is . " jennings adds that " anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual ( as the ' anarcho - capitalists ' appear to believe ) but , as we have already seen , for the extension of individuality and community . " nicolas walter wrote that " anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically . in a sense , anarchists always remain liberals and socialists , and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself . we are liberals but more so , and socialists but more so . " michael newman includes anarchism as one of many socialist traditions , especially the more socialist - aligned tradition following proudhon and mikhail bakunin . brian morris argues that it is " conceptually and historically misleading " to " create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought , defining anarchism is not an easy task for scholars , as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter , and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently . and etymology ( negation of rulers ) . major definitional elements include the will for a non - coercive society , the rejection of the state apparatus , the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a non - coercive society , and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before the establishment of towns and cities , an established authority did not exist . it was after the creation of institutions of authority that anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction . the most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece . in china , philosophical anarchism ( the discussion on the legitimacy of the state ) was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi . alongside stoicism , taoism has been said to have had " significant anticipations " of anarchism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece . aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy . socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience . cynics dismissed human law ( nomos ) and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature ( physis ) . stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in medieval europe , there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements . these , and other muslim movements , later gave birth to religious anarchism . in the sasanian empire , mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy , only to be soon executed by emperor kavad i . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in basra , religious sects preached against the state . in europe , various sects developed anti - state and libertarian tendencies . renewed interest in antiquity during the renaissance and in private judgment during the reformation restored elements of anti - authoritarian secularism , particularly in france . enlightenment challenges to intellectual authority ( secular and religious ) and the revolutions of the 1790s and 1848 all spurred the ideological development of what became the era of classical anarchism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the french revolution , partisan groups such as the enragés and the sans - culottes saw a turning point in the fermentation of anti - state and federalist sentiments . the first anarchist currents developed throughout the 18th century as william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england , morally delegitimising the state , max stirners thinking paved the way to individualism and pierre - joseph proudhons theory of mutualism found fertile soil in france . by the late 1870s , various anarchist schools of thought had become well - defined and a wave of then unprecedented globalisation occurred from 1880 to 1914 . this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war and is considered the golden age of anarchism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break drawing from mutualism , mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmens association , a class worker union later known as the first international that formed in 1864 to unite diverse revolutionary currents . the international became a significant political force , with karl marx being a leading figure and a member of its general council . bakunins faction ( the jura federation ) and proudhons followers ( the mutualists ) opposed state socialism , advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings . after bitter disputes , the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the 1872 hague congress . anarchists were treated similarly in the second international , being ultimately expelled in 1896 . bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marxs terms , they would end up the new tyrants of workers . in response to their expulsion from the first international , anarchists formed the st . imier international . under the influence of peter kropotkin , a russian philosopher and scientist , anarcho - communism overlapped with collectivism . anarcho - communists , who drew inspiration from the 1871 paris commune , advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to ones needs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the turn of the century , anarchism had spread all over the world . it was a notable feature of the international syndicalism movement . in china , small groups of students imported the humanistic pro - science version of anarcho - communism . tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east , travelling to the japanese capital to study . in latin america , argentina was a stronghold for anarcho - syndicalism , where it became the most prominent left - wing ideology . during this time , a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence . this strategy became known as propaganda of the deed . the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts . even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts , infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to exclude them from american immigration , including the immigration act of 1903 , also called the anarchist exclusion act . illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break despite concerns , anarchists enthusiastically participated in the russian revolution in opposition to the white movement ; however , they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government was stabilised . several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine , notably leading to the kronstadt rebellion and nestor makhnos struggle in the free territory . with the anarchists being crushed in russia , two new antithetical currents emerged , namely platformism and synthesis anarchism . the former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party . seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war , many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements . in france and the united states , members of major syndicalist movements such as the general confederation of labour and the industrial workers of the world left their organisations and joined the communist international . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the spanish civil war of 1936 , anarchists and syndicalists ( cnt and fai ) once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists . a long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war . in response to the army rebellion , an anarchist - inspired movement of peasants and workers , supported by armed militias , took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain , where they collectivised the land . the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war , but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named may days as joseph stalin tried to seize control of the republicans . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the end of world war ii , the anarchist movement was severely weakened . the 1960s witnessed a revival of anarchism , likely caused by a perceived failure of marxism–leninism and tensions built by the cold war . during this time , anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the anti - nuclear , environmental , and peace movements , the counterculture of the 1960s , and the new left . it also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative anti - capitalist reformism . anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols . the established feminist tendencies of anarcha - feminism returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism . black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchisms move from a eurocentric demographic . this coincided with its failure to gain traction in northern europe and its unprecedented height in latin america . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break around the turn of the 21st century , anarchism grew in popularity and influence within anti - capitalist , anti - war and anti - globalisation movements . anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization ( wto ) , the group of eight and the world economic forum . during the protests , ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting , property destruction and violent confrontations with the police . other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include affinity groups , security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet . a significant event of this period was the confrontations at the 1999 seattle wto conference . anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatistas in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria , more commonly known as rojava , a de facto autonomous region in northern syria . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions , social anarchism and individualist anarchism , owing to their different origins , values and evolution . the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual , while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership . in a chronological sense , anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late 19th century and the post - classical currents ( anarcha - feminism , green anarchism , and post - anarchism ) developed thereafter . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy , without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it . a component especially of individualist anarchism , philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but claims that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy . anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy . anarchisms emphasis on anti - capitalism , egalitarianism , and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from anarcho - capitalism and other types of economic libertarianism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchism is usually placed on the far - left of the political spectrum . much of its economics and legal philosophy reflect anti - authoritarian , anti - statist , libertarian , and radical interpretations of left - wing and socialist politics such as collectivism , communism , individualism , mutualism , and syndicalism , among other libertarian socialist economic theories . as anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview , many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely . one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives , a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del mármol in 1889 in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time . belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists . despite separation , the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy , mutual aid , network organisation , communal democracy , justified authority and decentralisation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism and individualism . they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism ( collectivist , communist and syndicalist ) . they differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mutualism is an 18th - century economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by pierre - joseph proudhon . its aims include reciprocity , free association , voluntary contract , federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people . mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism . in what is property ? ( 1840 ) , proudhon first characterised his goal as a " third form of society , the synthesis of communism and property . " collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin . collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked , rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism . collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarcho - communism is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production , direct democracy and a horizontal network of voluntary associations , workers ' councils and worker cooperatives , with production and consumption based on the guiding principle " from each according to his ability , to each according to his need . " anarcho - communism developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution but was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international . it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin , whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late 19th century . anarcho - syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change , replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self - managed by workers . the basic principles of anarcho - syndicalism are direct action , workers ' solidarity and workers ' self - management . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will over any kinds of external determinants . early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin , max stirner , and henry david thoreau . through many countries , individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left . interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the anti - globalisation movement , whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation . as the movement shaped 21st century radicalism , wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest . anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements , at times eclectic , drawing upon various sources and combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches . the anti - capitalist tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchisms historical association with chaos and violence . its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement , although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory . various anarchist groups , tendencies , and schools of thought exist today , making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement . while theorists and activists have established " relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles " , there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms , rather than a singular anarchism , in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently . gender equality can be a common principle , although it ranks as a higher priority to anarcha - feminists than anarcho - communists . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms , namely " all centralized and hierarchical forms of government ( for example , monarchy , representative democracy , state socialism , etcetera ) , economic class systems ( for example , capitalism , bolshevism , feudalism , slavery , etcetera ) , autocratic religions ( for example , fundamentalist islam , roman catholicism , etcetera ) , patriarchy , heterosexism , white supremacy , and imperialism . " anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed . the principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions . this entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state , resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchists ' tactics take various forms but in general serve two major goals , namely to first oppose the establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society , illustrating the unity of means and ends . a broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other . evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence , reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims , although there is significant overlap between the two . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century . anarchists during the early 20th century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the classical era , anarchists had a militant tendency . not only did they confront state armed forces , as in spain and ukraine , but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed . assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state , some of which were successful . anarchists also took part in revolutions . many anarchists , especially the galleanists , believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state . many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late 1870s , the early 1880s and the 1890s , with some still occurring in the early 1900s . their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been controversial . anarcho - pacifists advocate for non - violence means to achieve their stateless , nonviolent ends . other anarchist groups advocate direct action , a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or terrorism . this attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible . emma goldman and errico malatesta , who were proponents of limited use of violence , stated that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchists took an active role in strike actions , although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism , seeing it as reformist . they saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state and capitalism . anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts , some of whom practiced naturism and nudism . those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the current era , italian anarchist alfredo bonanno , a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism , has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late 19th century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards . both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small , informal affiliation groups , where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state , capitalism , and other enemies . members of the invisible committee were arrested in 2008 on various charges , terrorism included . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break overall , contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors . they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots , especially in countries such as canada , greece , and mexico . militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police ; however , anarchists not only clash with state operators , they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists , taking anti - fascist action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchists commonly employ direct action . this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy , or the form of self - managing their lives through the creation of counter - institutions such as communes and non - hierarchical collectives . decision - making is often handled in an anti - authoritarian way , with everyone having equal say in each decision , an approach known as horizontalism . contemporary - era anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism , although not explicitly anarchist , respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations . in contrast with the big - a anarchism of the classical era , the newly coined term small - a anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on classical - era anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as peter kropotkin and pierre - joseph proudhon to justify their opinions . those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the decision - making process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role . anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group . one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point . minorities usually accept rough consensus , except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics , goals and values . anarchists usually form small groups ( 5–20 individuals ) to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members . these kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other , forming larger networks . anarchists still support and participate in strikes , especially wildcat strikes as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as in the past , newspapers and journals are used , and anarchists have gone online in the world wide web to spread their message . anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties , hosting electronic libraries and other portals . anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free . the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals , especially when it comes to preserving users ' privacy from state surveillance . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchists organize themselves to squat and reclaim public spaces . during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied , they are often called temporary autonomous zones ( taz ) , spaces where art , poetry , and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal . as seen by anarchists , squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market , serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action . acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds . adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them , along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events , make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes , tendencies , and schools of thought ; disagreement over questions of values , ideology , and tactics is common . its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory . the compatibility of capitalism , nationalism , and religion with anarchism is widely disputed , and anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as communism , collectivism , marxism , and trade unionism . anarchists may be motivated by humanism , divine authority , enlightened self - interest , veganism , or any number of alternative ethical doctrines . phenomena such as civilisation , technology ( for example within anarcho - primitivism ) , and the democratic process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy , many anarchists address , analyse , and oppose the suppression of ones autonomy imposed by gender roles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing . sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as benjamin tucker , who opposed age of consent laws , believing they would benefit predatory men . a historical current that arose and flourished during 1890 and 1920 within anarchism was free love . in contemporary anarchism , this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism . free love advocates were against marriage , which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women , largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men . the notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited womens sexual freedom and pleasure . those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses , where large groups of travelers , anarchists and other activists slept in beds together . free love had roots both in europe and the united states ; however , some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love . anarchist feminists were advocates of free love , against marriage , and pro - choice ( utilising a contemporary term ) , and had a similar agenda . anarchist and non - anarchist feminists differed on suffrage but were supportive of one another . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the second half of the 20th century , anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism , radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well . by the latest decades of the 20th century , anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women , gays , queers and other marginalised groups , with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents . with the third wave of feminism , sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists , yielding a post - structuralist critique of sexual normality . some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking , suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism . anarchists consider proper education , one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society , to be an act of mutual aid . anarchist writers such as william godwin ( political justice ) and max stirner ( " the false principle of our education " ) attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1901 , catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church . ferrers approach was secular , rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance . ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students . the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested . nonetheless , his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of modern schools around the world . christian anarchist leo tolstoy , who published the essay education and culture , also established a similar school with its founding principle being that " for education to be effective it had to be free . " in a similar token , neill founded what became the summerhill school in 1921 , also declaring being free from coercion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a childs right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality would lead children to morally good conclusions ; however , there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation . ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality , liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism , along with other critiques of government and nationalism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break late 20th century and contemporary anarchist writers ( paul goodman , herbert read , and colin ward ) intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education , largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on childrens creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society . contemporary anarchists such as ward claim that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the modern - day , major tenets of anarchist schools , among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method , have spread among mainstream educational institutions . judith suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools , namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of a wider american - canadian network of schools , the self - managed learning college in brighton , england , and the paideia school in spain . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break objection to the state and its institutions is a sine qua non of anarchism . anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies . instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life , major decisions are taken by a small elite . authority ultimately rests solely on power , regardless of whether that power is open or transparent , as it still has the ability to coerce people . another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government , even the most altruistic among officials , will unavoidably seek to gain more power , leading to corruption . anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary . robert paul wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate . bakunin saw the state as meaning " coercion , domination by means of coercion , camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be . " john simmons and leslie green , who leaned toward philosophical anarchism , believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus , although they saw this as highly unlikely . beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism , especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists , surrealists and others . in literature , anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the neo - romanticism movement . in music , anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk . anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read stated that the border between the artist and the non - artist , what separates art from a daily act , is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends . in his book breaking the spell : a history of anarchist filmmakers , videotape guerrillas , and digital ninjas , chris robé claims that " anarchist - inflected practices have increasingly structured movement - based video activism . " throughout the 20th century , many prominent anarchists ( peter kropotkin , emma goldman , gustav landauer and camillo berneri ) and publications such as anarchy wrote about matters pertaining to the arts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists . it could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies , serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests . as it appeals to both emotion and reason , art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect . the 19th - century neo - impressionist movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism . in les chataigniers a osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro , the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the most common critique of anarchism is that humans cannot self - govern and so a state is necessary for human survival . philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique , stating that " peace and war , tariffs , regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs , the preservation of a just system of distribution : these , among others , are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government . " another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be self - governing ; a response would be that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break philosophy lecturer andrew fiala composed a list of common arguments against anarchism which includes critiques such as that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction , not only in the pragmatic world , such as at protests , but in the world of ethics as well . secondly , anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state cannot be defeated practically . this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it . the third argument is that anarchism is self - contradictory . while it advocates for no - one to archiei , if accepted by the many , then anarchism would turn into the ruling political theory . in this line of criticism also comes the self - contradiction that anarchism calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual , hence no collective action can be taken . lastly , fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective ( all talk and thoughts ) and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of pro - anarchist books such as john simmons ' moral principles and political obligations . law professor william edmundson authored an essay to argue against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious . edmundson says that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience , this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate . in the problem of political authority , michael huemer defends philosophical anarchism , claiming that " political authority is a moral illusion . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one of the earliest criticisms is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority . joseph raz states that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success . raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities ' successful and mistaken instruction . anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable , nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment . anarchist perception of human nature , rejection of the state , and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive , overly simplistic , and unrealistic , respectively . classical anarchism has been criticised for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break friedrich engels , considered to be one of the principal founders of marxism , criticised anarchisms anti - authoritarianism as inherently counter - revolutionary because in his view a revolution is by itself authoritarian . academic john molyneux writes in his book anarchism : a marxist criticism that " anarchism cannot win " , believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas . the marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values . according to the marxist view , that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence . marxists state that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act . in the anarchist vision , the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 2: Autism ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break kanner autism , or classic autism , is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by challenges with social communication , and by restricted and repetitive behaviors . which is the convention used in much of this entry , but it is now more commonly used for the spectrum at large . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break parents often notice signs of autism during the first three years of their childs life . these signs often develop gradually , though some autistic children experience regression in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break autism has been hypothesized to be associated with a combination of genetic and environmental factors , with genetic factors thought to heavily predominate . factors which may influence likelihood of autism during pregnancy include certain infections , such as rubella , toxins including valproic acid , alcohol , cocaine , pesticides , lead , and air pollution , fetal growth restriction , lt ; ! - contemporary diagnostic manuals include only one diagnostic category for autism spectrum disorder ( asd ) , including classic autism along with asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified ( pdd - nos ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there is no ' treatment ' for autism as such , and many sources advise that this is not an appropriate goal , although treatment of co - occurring conditions remains an important goal . behavioral , psychological , education , and / or skill - building interventions may be used to assist autistic people to learn life skills necessary for living independently , as well as other social , communication , and language skills . therapy also aims to reduce challenging behaviors and build upon strengths . some autistic adults are unable to live independently . an autistic culture has developed , with a minority of individuals seeking a cure , and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference to be accommodated instead of cured . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break globally , classic autism was estimated to affect 24 million people . the number of people diagnosed had increased considerably since the 1990s , which may be partly due to increased recognition of the condition . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood , and generally follows a steady course without remission . overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months , become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood , although often in more muted form . it was said to be distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms : impairments in social interaction , impairments in communication , and repetitive behavior . other aspects , such as atypical eating , are also common but are not essential for diagnosis . individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly , without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break social deficits distinguish autism spectrum disorders from other developmental disorders . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood . autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli , smile and look at others less often , and respond less to their own name . autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social norms ; for example , they have less eye contact and turn - taking , and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves , such as pointing at things . most autistic children display moderately less attachment security than neurotypical children , although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits . older children and adults with asd perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a persons own emotions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break children with high - functioning autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non - autistic peers , despite the common belief that autistic children prefer to be alone . making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for autistic people . for them , the quality of friendships , not the number of friends , predicts how lonely they feel . functional friendships , such as those resulting in invitations to parties , may affect the quality of life more deeply . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are many anecdotal reports , but few systematic studies , of aggression and violence in individuals with asd . the limited data suggest that , in children with intellectual disability , autism is associated with aggression , destruction of property , and meltdowns . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break about one third to half of autistic people do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs . differences in communication may be present from the first year of life , and may include delayed onset of babbling , unusual gestures , diminished responsiveness , and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver . in the second and third years , autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling , consonants , words , and word combinations ; their gestures are less often integrated with words . autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences , and are more likely to simply repeat others ' words ( echolalia ) uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a pair of studies , high - functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as , and as adults better than , individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling . both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language , comprehension , and inference . as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills , these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior , which the repetitive behavior scale - revised ( rbs - r ) categorizes as follows . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break no single repetitive or self - injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism , but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis , but that can affect the individual or the family . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an estimated 0 to 10 of individuals with asd show unusual abilities , ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious autistic savants . many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention , relative to the general population . sensory abnormalities are found in over 90 of autistic people , and are considered core features by some , although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders . differences are greater for under - responsivity ( for example , walking into things ) than for over - responsivity ( for example , distress from loud noises ) or for sensation seeking ( for example , rhythmic movements ) . an estimated 60–80 of autistic people have motor signs that include poor muscle tone , poor motor planning , and toe walking ; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper . unusual eating behavior occurs in about three - quarters of children with asd , to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator . selectivity is the most common problem , although eating rituals and food refusal also occur . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there is tentative evidence that gender dysphoria occurs more frequently in autistic people ( see autism and lgbt identities ) . as well as that , a 2021 anonymized online survey of 16 - 90 year - olds revealed that autistic males are more likely to be bisexual , while autistic females are more likely to be homosexual . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gastrointestinal problems are one of the most commonly co - occurring medical conditions in autistic people . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress . siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship . however , they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down syndrome ; siblings of individuals with asd have greater likelihood of negative well - being and poorer sibling relationships as adults . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic , cognitive , and neural levels for autisms characteristic triad of symptoms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break autism has a strong genetic basis , although the genetics of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects , or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants . complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes , the environment , and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression . many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents . studies of twins suggest that heritability is 0 for autism and as high as 0 for asd , and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population . the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural variation—such as deletions , duplications or inversions in genetic material during meiosis . hence , a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited : that is , the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome . autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition , but genetic phenomena such as imprinting and x linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males , and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often , such as the imprinted brain hypothesis and the extreme male brain theory . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment . intrauterine growth restriction is associated with asd , in both term and preterm infants . maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues , aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break exposure to air pollution during pregnancy , especially heavy metals and particulates , may increase the likelihood of an autism diagnosis . environmental factors that have been claimed , without evidence , to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods , infectious diseases , solvents , pcbs , phthalates and phenols used in plastic products , pesticides , brominated flame retardants , alcohol , smoking , illicit drugs , vaccines , and prenatal stress . some , such as the mmr vaccine , have been completely disproven . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination . this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine " overload " , a vaccine preservative , or the mmr vaccine for causing autism . the latter theory was supported by a litigation - funded study that has since been shown to have been " an elaborate fraud " . although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible , parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations , outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases in some countries , and the preventable deaths of several children . accines and autism : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break diagnosis is based on behavior , not cause or mechanism . under the dsm - 5 , autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts , as well as restricted , repetitive patterns of behavior , interests , or activities . these deficits are present in early childhood , typically before age three , and lead to clinically significant functional impairment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several diagnostic instruments are available . two are commonly used in autism research : the autism diagnostic interview - revised ( adi - r ) is a semistructured parent interview , and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ( ados ) uses observation and interaction with the child . the childhood autism rating scale ( cars ) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child . if warranted , diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists , observing and assessing cognitive , communication , family , and other factors using standardized tools , and taking into account any associated medical conditions . a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability , hearing impairment , and a specific language impairment the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as depression . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed , particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause . although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40 of cases to genetic causes , consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to high - resolution chromosome and fragile x testing . as new genetic tests are developed several ethical , legal , and social issues will emerge . commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results , given the complexity of autisms genetics . metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful , but are not routine . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months , although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life : for example , a one - year - old who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a three - year - old to continue to do so a few years later . although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood , they are sometimes missed ; years later , adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves , to help their employers make adjustments , or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break signs of autism may be more challenging for clinicians to detect in females . autistic females have been shown to engage in masking more frequently than autistic males . a notable percentage of autistic females may be misdiagnosed , diagnosed after a considerable delay , or not diagnosed at all . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break conversely , the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis . it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired , partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision , and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the fourth edition of the american psychiatric associations diagnostic manual , dsm - iv , listed autistic disorder as one of the five pervasive developmental disorders ( pdd ) , but these were collapsed into the single diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in 2013 , and the whos diagnostic manual icd - 11 ( which had listed it as ' childhood autism ' in its previous edition ) followed suit a few years later . it was said to be characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication , severely restricted interests , and highly repetitive behavior . these symptoms do not imply sickness , fragility , or emotional disturbance . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break of the five pdd forms , asperger syndrome was closest to classic autism in signs and likely causes ; rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with it , but may have unrelated causes ; pdd not otherwise specified ( pdd - nos ; also called atypical autism ) was diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder . people would usually attract a diagnosis of asperger syndrome rather than classic autism if they showed no substantial delay in language development , but studies found that early language ability was a poor predictor of outcomes in adulthood . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry , psychology , neurology and pediatrics . newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes ( observable traits ) that can be viewed on brain scans , to help further neurogenetic studies of autism ; one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain , which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects . it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior . ( for more , see brett abrahams , geneticist and neuroscientist ) uvmr_ev_paragraph_break autism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum , ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent , developmentally disabled , and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches , narrowly focused interests , and verbose , pedantic communication . because the behavior spectrum is continuous , boundaries between diagnostic categories were necessarily somewhat arbitrary . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the main goals when treating autistic children are to lessen associated deficits and family distress , and to increase quality of life and functional independence . in general , higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes . no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the childs needs . families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment . however , the development of evidence - based interventions has advanced in recent years . although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence , suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment , the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor , their clinical results are mostly tentative , and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options . intensive , sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire self - care , communication , and job skills , claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated . while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms , they may be used for associated symptoms , such as irritability , inattention , or repetitive behavior patterns . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis ( aba ) , developmental models , structured teaching , speech and language therapy , social skills therapy , and occupational therapy and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression , anxiety , and obsessive - compulsive disorder . among these approaches , interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively , or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit . two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include structured and naturalistic aba interventions , and developmental social pragmatic models ( dsp ) . one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model , which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques , allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves . various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at - home parent implementation . despite the recent development of parent training models , these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies , being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break early , intensive aba therapy has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool children ; it is also well - established for improving the intellectual performance of that age group . the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break medications may be used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails . they may also be used for associated health problems , such as adhd or anxiety . the atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are fda - approved for treating associated aggressive and self - injurious behaviors . however , their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits , and autistic people may respond atypically . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although many alternative therapies and interventions are available , few are supported by scientific studies . in 2005 , botched chelation therapy killed a five - year - old child with autism . chelation is not recommended for autistic people since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits . another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy , a mixture of homeopathy , supplements , and ' vaccine detoxing ' . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although popularly used as an alternative treatment for autistic people , there is no good evidence to recommend a gluten - and casein - free diet as a standard treatment . a 2018 review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism , such as those with known food intolerances or allergies , or with food intolerance markers . the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the gluten - and casein - free diet in children with asd ( 4 in total ) . all of them compared gluten - and casein - free diet versus normal diet with a control group ( 2 double - blind randomized controlled trials , 1 double - blind crossover trial , 1 single - blind trial ) . in two of the studies , whose duration was 12 and 24 months , a significant improvement in asd symptoms ( efficacy rate 50 ) was identified . in the other two studies , whose duration was 3 months , no significant effect was observed . in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten - free diet may improve some autistic behaviors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break results of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support mindfulness - based interventions for improving mental health . this includes decreasing stress , anxiety , ruminating thoughts , anger , and aggression . there has been early research looking at hyperbaric treatments in children with autism . studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there is no known cure for autism . this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not . it is not known how often this outcome happens ; many autistic children lack social support , future employment opportunities or self - determination . although core difficulties tend to persist , symptoms often become less severe with age . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break few high - quality studies address long - term prognosis . some adults show modest improvement in communication skills , but a few decline ; no study has focused on autism after midlife . acquiring language before age six , having an iq above 50 , and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes ; independent living is unlikely with severe autism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many autistic people face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood . compared to the general population autistic people are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job . about half of people in their 20s with autism are not employed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break autistic people tend to face increased stress levels related to psychosocial factors , such as stigma , which may increase the rates of mental health issues in the autistic population . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break globally , classic autism was understood to affect an estimated 24 million people . ( particularly among women ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break males had higher likelihood of being diagnosed with autism than females . the sex ratio averaged 4 : 1 and was greatly modified by cognitive impairment : it may have been close to 2 : 1 with intellectual disability and more than 5 : 1 without . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several other conditions are common in children with autism . they include : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named . the table talk of martin luther , compiled by his notetaker , mathesius , contains the story of a 12 - year - old boy who may have been severely autistic . the earliest well - documented case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue , as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blairs marriage to gain blairs inheritance . the wild boy of aveyron , a feral child caught in 1798 , showed several signs of autism ; the medical student jean itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the new latin word autismus ( english translation autism ) was coined by the swiss psychiatrist eugen bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia . he derived it from the greek word autós ( αὐτός , meaning " self " ) , and used it to mean morbid self - admiration , referring to " autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies , against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance " . a soviet child psychiatrist , grunya sukhareva , described a similar syndrome that was published in russian in 1925 , and in german in 1926 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word autism first took its modern sense in 1938 when hans asperger of the vienna university hospital adopted bleulers terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology . asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome , though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981 . almost all the characteristics described in kanners first paper on the subject , notably " autistic aloneness " and " insistence on sameness " , are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break kanners reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia , and child psychiatrys focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infants response to " refrigerator mothers " . starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as late as the mid - 1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism , while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions . although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed , and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it took until 1980 for the dsm - iii to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia . in 1987 , the dsm - iii - r provided a checklist for diagnosing autism . in may 2013 , the dsm - 5 was released , updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders . the grouping of disorders , including pdd - nos , autism , asperger syndrome , rett syndrome , and cdd , has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders . the two categories that exist are impaired social communication and / or interaction , and restricted and / or repetitive behaviors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with , and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely . societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed : some in the community seek a cure , while others believe that autism is simply another way of being . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an autistic culture has emerged , accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements . events include world autism awareness day , autism sunday , autistic pride day , autreat , and others . social science scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about " autism as a culture , transcultural comparisons and research on social movements . " many autistic individuals have been successful in their fields . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity , viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured . autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome . this perspective is distinct from fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines . a common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are " high - functioning " or have asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of " low - functioning " autistic people . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break about half of autistic people are unemployed , and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed . among those who find work in the united states , most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum . while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision , experienced employers of autistic people give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees . some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 3: Albedo ***********

albedo ( ; ) is the measure of the diffuse reflection of solar radiation out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from 0 , corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation , to 1 , corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity je to the irradiance ee ( flux per unit area ) received by a surface . the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself , but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earths surface . these factors vary with atmospheric composition , geographic location , and time ( see position of the sun ) . while bi - hemispherical reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence ( that is , for a given position of the sun ) , albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period . the temporal resolution may range from seconds ( as obtained from flux measurements ) to daily , monthly , or annual averages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unless given for a specific wavelength ( spectral albedo ) , albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation . due to measurement constraints , it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface ( between 0 and 3 μm ) . this spectrum includes visible light ( 0–0 μm ) , which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark ( for example , trees absorb most radiation ) , whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright ( for example , snow reflects most radiation ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albedo is an important concept in climatology , astronomy , and environmental management ( for example , as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design ( leed ) program for sustainable rating of buildings ) . the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere , its planetary albedo , is 30–35 because of cloud cover , but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his 1760 work photometria . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0 for fresh snow to about 0 for charcoal , one of the darkest substances . deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body . when seen from a distance , the ocean surface has a low albedo , as do most forests , whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of 0 to 0 . the average albedo of earth is about 0 . this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break earths surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasas modis instruments on board the terra and aqua satellites , and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and jpss . as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite , not all directions , a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of directional - hemispherical reflectance and bi - hemispherical reflectance ( for example , ) . these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( brdf ) , which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle . bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break earths average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about 15 if earth were frozen entirely ( and hence be more reflective ) , the average temperature of the planet would drop below - 40 if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers , the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 in contrast , if the entire earth was covered by water – a so - called ocean planet – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2021 , scientists reported that earth dimmed by 0 over two decades ( 1998 - 2017 ) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques . this may have both been co - caused by climate change as well as a substantial increase in global warming . however , the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for land surfaces , it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle θ ' i can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with 1 - d being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle , and d being the proportion of diffuse illumination , the actual albedo alpha ( also called blue - sky albedo ) can then be given as : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light , except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earths surface at that location ( for example through melting of reflective ice ) . that said , albedo and illumination both vary by latitude . albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics , with a local maximum in the tropics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation ( solar irradiance ) ; high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation , whereas areas such as the sahara desert , which also have a relatively high albedo , will be hotter due to high insolation . tropical and sub - tropical rainforest areas have low albedo , and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts , which have lower insolation . because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo , high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb , effectively cooling the earth . this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures , creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker ( being water or ground which is darker color ) and reflects less heat back into space . this feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs . the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land , ice , or ocean surfaces can drive weather . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when an areas albedo changes due to snowfall , a snow–temperature feedback results . a layer of snowfall increases local albedo , reflecting away sunlight , leading to local cooling . in principle , if no outside temperature change affects this area ( for example , a warm air mass ) , the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall , deepening the snow–temperature feedback . however , because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons , eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight ( higher insolation ) cause melting . when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo , such as grass , soil , or ocean , the effect is reversed : the darkening surface lowers albedo , increasing local temperatures , which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further , resulting in still more heating . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break snow albedo is highly variable , ranging from as high as 0 for freshly fallen snow , to about 0 for melting snow , and as low as 0 for dirty snow . over antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than 0 . if a marginally snow - covered area warms , snow tends to melt , lowering the albedo , and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack ( the ice–albedo positive feedback ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow , the albedo of snow - covered sea ice is far higher than that of sea water . sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow . when sea ice melts , either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above , the snow - covered surface is reduced , and more surface of sea water is exposed , so the rate of energy absorption increases . the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water , which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts . as with the preceding example of snowmelt , the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedback . both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cryoconite , powdery windblown dust containing soot , sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback , together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo , can lead to large errors in energy estimates . because of this , in order to reduce the error of energy estimates , it is important to measure the albedo of snow - covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albedo works on a smaller scale , too . in sunlight , dark clothes absorb more heat and light - coloured clothes reflect it better , thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic devices . for example , the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon ( a - si : h ) and crystalline silicon ( c - si ) - based compared to traditional spectral - integrated albedo predictions . research showed impacts of over 10 . more recently , the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials ( both human - made and natural ) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies : industrial ( solar farms ) , commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched - roof applications . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break because forests generally have a low albedo , ( the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis ) , some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation ( or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation ) . in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect . scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact , and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in seasonally snow - covered zones , winter albedos of treeless areas are 10 to 50 higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily . deciduous trees have an albedo value of about 0 to 0 whereas coniferous trees have a value of about 0 to 0 . variation in summer albedo across both forest types is associated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper canopy . ite journal uvmr_ev_paragraph_break studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative ( generally warming ) effect of albedo change and ( cooling ) effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests . they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool ; new forests in high latitudes ( for example , siberia ) were neutral or perhaps warming . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials . the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular manner ( not diffusely ) . the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this . at small angles of incident light , waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity - vs . incident - angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light , it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator ( early morning , late afternoon , and near the poles ) . however , as mentioned above , waviness causes an appreciable reduction . because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer , water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break note that white caps on waves look white ( and have high albedo ) because the water is foamed up , so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect , adding up their reflectivities . fresh ' black ' ice exhibits fresnel reflection . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to 0 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures . different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity , theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0 . " on any given day , about half of earth is covered by clouds , which reflect more sunlight than land and water . clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight , but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds , such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic . a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 c - change colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aerosols ( very fine particles / droplets in the atmosphere ) have both direct and indirect effects on earths radiative balance . the direct ( albedo ) effect is generally to cool the planet ; the indirect effect ( the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties ) is less certain . as per spracklen and others the effects are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in extremely polluted cities like delhi , aerosol pollutants influence local weather and induce an urban cool island effect during the day . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another albedo - related effect on the climate is from black carbon particles . the size of this effect is difficult to quantify : the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is 0 w m−2 , with a range 0 to 0 w m−2 . black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break human activities ( for example , deforestation , farming , and urbanization ) change the albedo of various areas around the globe . however , quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult ; further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in astronomy , the term albedo can be defined in several different ways , depending upon the application and the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation involved . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the albedos of planets , satellites and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties . the study of albedos , their dependence on wavelength , lighting angle ( " phase angle " ) , and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry . for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes , much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos . for example , the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects , the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties , whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break enceladus , a moon of saturn , has one of the highest known optical albedos of any body in the solar system , with an albedo of 0 . another notable high - albedo body is eris , with an albedo of 0 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many small objects in the outer solar systemcite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around 0 , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break but it is strongly directional and non - lambertian , displaying also a strong opposition effect . although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains , they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break two common optical albedos that are used in astronomy are the ( v - band ) geometric albedo ( measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer ) and the bond albedo ( measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected ) . their values can differ significantly , which is a common source of confusion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in detailed studies , the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which semi - empirically describe the variation of albedo with phase angle , including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces . one of these five parameters is yet another type of albedo called the single - scattering albedo . it is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles . it depends on properties of the material ( refractive index ) , the size of the particle , and the wavelength of the incoming radiation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an important relationship between an objects astronomical ( geometric ) albedo , absolute magnitude and diameter is given by : cite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break where a is the astronomical albedo , d is the diameter in kilometers , and h is the absolute magnitude . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in planetary radar astronomy , a microwave ( or radar ) pulse is transmitted toward a planetary target ( for example moon , asteroid , etcetera ) and the echo from the target is measured . in most instances , the transmitted pulse is circularly polarized and the received pulse is measured in the same sense of polarization as the transmitted pulse ( sc ) and the opposite sense ( oc ) . the echo power is measured in terms of radar cross - section , sigmaoc , sigmasc , or sigmat ( total power , sc oc ) and is equal to the cross - sectional area of a metallic sphere ( perfect reflector ) at the same distance as the target that would return the same echo power . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break those components of the received echo that return from first - surface reflections ( as from a smooth or mirror - like surface ) are dominated by the oc component as there is a reversal in polarization upon reflection . if the surface is rough at the wavelength scale or there is significant penetration into the regolith , there will be a significant sc component in the echo caused by multiple scattering . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for most objects in the solar system , the oc echo dominates and the most commonly reported radar albedo parameter is the ( normalized ) oc radar albedo ( often shortened to radar albedo ) : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break where the denominator is the effective cross - sectional area of the target object with mean radius , r . a smooth metallic sphere would have hatsigmaoc 1 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the values reported for the moon , mercury , mars , venus , and comet p / 2005 jq5 are derived from the total ( ocsc ) radar albedo reported in those references . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the event that most of the echo is from first surface reflections ( hatsigmaoc or so ) , the oc radar albedo is a first - order approximation of the fresnel reflection coefficient ( aka reflectivity ) uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 4: A ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a , or a , is the first letter and the first vowel of the modern english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet . it is similar in shape to the ancient greek letter alpha , from which it derives . the uppercase version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle , crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar . the lowercase version can be written in two forms : the double - storey a and single - storey ɑ . the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it , especially fonts intended to be read by children , and is also found in italic type . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the english grammar , " a " , and its variant " an " , are indefinite articles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ʾalp uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earliest certain ancestor of " a " is aleph ( also written ' aleph ) , the first letter of the phoenician alphabet , which consisted entirely of consonants ( for that reason , it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet ) . in turn , the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in proto - sinaitic script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs , styled as a triangular head with two horns extended . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when the ancient greeks adopted the alphabet , they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal stop—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician and other semitic languages , and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of alpha . in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages , dating to the 8th century bc , the letter rests upon its side , but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter , although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg , or by the angle at which the cross line is set . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the etruscans brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged . the romans later adopted the etruscan alphabet to write the latin language , and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin alphabet that would come to be used to write many languages , including english . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during roman times , there were many variant forms of the letter " a " . first was the monumental or lapidary style , which was used when inscribing on stone or other " permanent " media . there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing , which was done on more perishable surfaces . due to the " perishable " nature of these surfaces , there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental , but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive , such as majuscule cursive , minuscule cursive , and semicursive minuscule . variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles . the known variants include the early semi - uncial , the uncial , and the later semi - uncial . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break typographic variants include a double - storey a and single - storey ɑ . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the end of the roman empire ( 5th century ad ) , several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe . among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy , the merovingian script in france , the visigothic script in spain , and the insular or anglo - irish semi - uncial or anglo - saxon majuscule of great britain . by the 9th century , the caroline script , which was very similar to the present - day form , was the principal form used in book - making , before the advent of the printing press . this form was derived through a combining of prior forms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 15th - century italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today . these variants , the italic and roman forms , were derived from the caroline script version . the italic form , also called script a , is used in most current handwriting ; it consists of a circle and vertical stroke on the right ( " ɑ " ) . this slowly developed from the fifth - century form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers . the roman form is used in most printed material ; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ( " a " ) . both derive from the majuscule ( capital ) form . in greek handwriting , it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop , as demonstrated by the uncial version shown . many fonts then made the right leg vertical . in some of these , the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc , resulting in the printed form , while in others it was dropped , resulting in the modern handwritten form . graphic designers refer to the italic and roman forms as " single decker a " and " double decker a " respectively . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest ( set in roman type ) . there are some other cases aside from italic type where script a ( " ɑ " ) , also called latin alpha , is used in contrast with latin " a " ( such as in the international phonetic alphabet ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in modern english orthography , the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the double sequence does not occur in native english words , but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as aaron and aardvark . however , occurs in many common digraphs , all with their own sound or sounds , particularly , , , , and . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break is the third - most - commonly used letter in english ( after and ) and french , the second most common in spanish , and the most common in portuguese . about 8 of letters used in english texts tend to be ; the number is around 7 in french , 11 in spanish , and 14 for portuguese . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in most languages that use the latin alphabet , denotes an open unrounded vowel , such as , , or . an exception is saanich , in which ( and the glyph á ) stands for a close - mid front unrounded vowel . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in phonetic and phonemic notation : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in algebra , the letter a along with various other letters of the alphabet is often used to denote a variable , with various conventional meanings in different areas of mathematics . moreover , in 1637 , rené descartes " invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by x , y , and z , and knowns by a , b , and c " , and this convention is still often followed , especially in elementary algebra . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in geometry , capital a , b , c etcetera are used to denote segments , lines , rays , etcetera a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle , the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " a " is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status : a− , a or a , the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students ' schoolwork ; " a grade " for clean restaurants ; a - list celebrities , etcetera such associations can have a motivating effect , as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance , when compared with other letters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " a " is used as a prefix on some words , such as asymmetry , to mean " not " or " without " ( from greek ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in english grammar , " a " , and its variant " an " , is an indefinite article , used to introduce noun phrases . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break finally , the letter a is used to denote size , as in a narrow size shoe , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break these are the code points for the forms of the letter in various systems uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the hexadecimal ( base 16 ) numbering system , a is a number that corresponds to the number 10 in decimal ( base 10 ) counting . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 5: Alabama ***********

alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the united states , bordered by tennessee to the north ; georgia to the east ; florida and the gulf of mexico to the south ; and mississippi to the west . alabama is the 30th largest by area and the 24th - most populous of the states . with a total of 1500 mi of inland waterways , alabama has among the most of any state . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alabama is nicknamed the yellowhammer state , after the state bird . alabama is also known as the " heart of dixie " and the " cotton state " . the state tree is the longleaf pine , and the state flower is the camellia . alabamas capital is montgomery , and its largest city by population and area is huntsville . its oldest city is mobile , founded by french colonists in 1702 as the capital of french louisiana . greater birmingham is alabamas largest metropolitan area and its economic center . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break originally home to many native tribes , present - day alabama was a spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the french acquired it in the early eighteenth century . the british won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the american revolutionary war . spain held mobile as part of spanish west florida until 1813 . in december 1819 , alabama was recognized as a state . during the antebellum period , alabama was a major producer of cotton , and widely used african american slave labor . in 1861 , the state seceded from the united states to become part of the confederate states of america , with montgomery acting as its first capital , and rejoined the union in 1868 . following the american civil war , alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship , in part due to agriculture and a few cash crops being the main driver of the states economy . similar to other former slave states , alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws which disenfranchised and discriminated against african americans and also alabamas french creole population from the late 19th century up until the 1960s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the early 20th century , despite the growth of major industries and urban centers , white rural interests dominated the state legislature through the mid - 20th century . during this time , urban interests and african americans were markedly under - represented . high - profile events such as the selma to montgomery march made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s . during and after world war ii , alabama grew as the states economy diversified with new industries . nasas marshall space flight center in huntsville would help alabamas economic growth in the mid - to - late 20th century , by developing an aerospace industry . alabamas economy in the 21st century is based on automotive , finance , tourism , manufacturing , aerospace , mineral extraction , healthcare , education , retail , and technology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the states geography is diverse , with the north dominated by the mountainous tennessee valley and the south by mobile bay , a historically significant port . politically , as part of the deep south , alabama is predominantly a conservative state , and culturally is known for its southern culture . within alabama , american football , particularly at the college level at schools such as the university of alabama , auburn university , alabama am university , alabama state university , troy university , the university of south alabama , and jacksonville state university , play a major part of the states culture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the european - american naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people , a muskogean - speaking tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa and tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river . in the alabama language , the word for a person of alabama lineage is albaamo ( or variously albaama or albàamo in different dialects ; the plural form is albaamaha ) . the suggestion that " alabama " was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely . the words spelling varies significantly among historical sources . and possibly alabahmu . the use of state names derived from native american languages is common in the ; an estimated 27 states have names of native american origin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sources disagree on the words meaning . some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba ( meaning ' plants ' or ' weeds ' ) and amo ( meaning ' to cut ' , ' to trim ' , or ' to gather ' ) . the meaning may have been ' clearers of the thicket ' referring to clearing land for cultivation however , there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an 1842 article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant ' here we rest ' . this notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of alexander beaufort meek . experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization . trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period ( 1000bce700ce ) and continued until european contact . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 ce , with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville , alabama . this is the second - largest complex of the classic middle mississippian era , after cahokia in present - day illinois , which was the center of the culture . analysis of artifacts from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars ' formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex ( secc ) . contrary to popular belief , the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture , but developed independently . the ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian peoples ; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break among the historical tribes of native american people living in present - day alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee , an iroquoian language people ; and the muskogean - speaking alabama ( alibamu ) , chickasaw , choctaw , creek , and koasati . while part of the same large language family , the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama during their exploration of north america in the 16th century . the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in 1540 . more than 160 years later , the french founded the regions first european settlement at old mobile in 1702 . the city was moved to the current site of mobile in 1711 . this area was claimed by the french from 1702 to 1763 as part of la louisiane . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the french lost to the british in the seven years ' war , it became part of british west florida from 1763 to 1783 . after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war , the territory was divided between the united states and spain . the latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to forces on april 13 , 1813 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break thomas bassett , a loyalist to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era , was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile . he settled in the tombigbee district during the early 1770s . the districts boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county , northernmost mobile county , and most of washington county . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break what is now the counties of baldwin and mobile became part of spanish west florida in 1783 , part of the independent republic of west florida in 1810 , and was finally added to the mississippi territory in 1812 . most of what is now the northern two - thirds of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period . it was claimed by the province of georgia from 1767 onwards . following the revolutionary war , it remained a part of georgia , although heavily disputed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands , what is now the lower one - third of alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in 1798 . the yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804 , following the yazoo land scandal . spain kept a claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the adams–onís treaty officially ceded it to the united states in 1819 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before mississippis admission to statehood on december 10 , 1817 , the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory . the united states congress created the alabama territory on march 3 , 1817 . st . stephens , now abandoned , served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on december 14 , 1819 , with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention . from july5 to august 2 , 1819 , delegates met to prepare the new state constitution . huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820 , when the seat of government moved to cahaba in dallas county . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cahaba , now a ghost town , was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825 . the alabama fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the union , with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation . part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s , its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought slaves with them as the cotton plantations in alabama expanded . the economy of the central black belt ( named for its dark , productive soil ) was built around large cotton plantations whose owners ' wealth grew mainly from slave labor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 1826 to 1846 , tuscaloosa served as alabamas capital . on january 30 , 1846 , the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery . the first legislative session in the new capital met in december 1847 . a new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia . the first structure burned down in 1849 , but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851 . this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day . it was designed by barachias holt of exeter , maine . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by 1860 , the population had increased to 964201 people , of which nearly half , 435080 , were enslaved african americans , and 2690 were free people of color . on january 11 , 1861 , alabama declared its secession from the union . after remaining an independent republic for a few days , it joined the confederate states of america . the confederacys capital was initially at montgomery . alabama was heavily involved in the american civil war . although comparatively few battles were fought in the state , alabama contributed about 120000 soldiers to the war effort . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville , alabama , joined nathan bedford forrests battalion in hopkinsville , kentucky . the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves , collar and coattails . this led to them being greeted with " yellowhammer " , and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alabamas slaves were freed by the 13th amendment in 1865 . alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may 1865 until its official restoration to the union in 1868 . from 1867 to 1874 , with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised , many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state . alabama was represented in congress during this period by three african - american congressmen : jeremiah haralson , benjamin turner , and james rapier . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following the war , the state remained chiefly agricultural , with an economy tied to cotton . during reconstruction , state legislators ratified a new state constitution in 1868 which created the states first public school system and expanded womens rights . legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects , although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation . organized insurgent , resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans . besides the short - lived original ku klux klan , these included the pale faces , knights of the white camellia , red shirts , and the white league . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reconstruction in alabama ended in 1874 , when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office through an election dominated by fraud and violence . they wrote another constitution in 1875 , the same year , legislation was approved that called for racially segregated schools . railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the new 1901 constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disenfranchised large portions of the population , including nearly all african americans and native americans , and tens of thousands of poor european americans , through making voter registration difficult , requiring a poll tax and literacy test . the 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools . by 1903 only 2980 african americans were registered in alabama , although at least 74000 were literate . this compared to more than 181000 african americans eligible to vote in 1900 . the numbers dropped even more in later decades . the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s : jails were segregated in 1911 ; hospitals in 1915 ; toilets , hotels , and restaurants in 1928 ; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting , the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well , due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax . nearly all blacks had lost the ability to vote . despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions , the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement . the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the rural - dominated alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans , but it did not relieve them of paying taxes . partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south , the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools . in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds , which paid one - third of the construction costs . the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest . black residents effectively taxed themselves twice , by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools , which were built in many rural areas . they often donated land and labor as well . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beginning in 1913 , the first 80 rosenwald schools were built in alabama for african - american children . a total of 387 schools , seven teachers ' houses , and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state . several of the surviving school buildings in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break continued racial discrimination and lynchings , agricultural depression , and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the great migration out of the south . reflecting this emigration , the population growth rate in alabama ( see " historical populations " table below ) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the same time , many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham to work in new industrial jobs . birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the " magic city " . by 1920 , birmingham was the 36th - largest city in the united states . heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy . its residents were under - represented for decades in the state legislature , which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes , as it was required by the state constitution . this did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war . cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961 , the rural - dominated legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population , as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses . they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas . one result was that jefferson county , containing birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse , contributed more than one - third of all tax revenue to the state , but did not receive a proportional amount in services . urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature . a 1960 study noted that because of rural domination , " a minority of about 25 of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the united states supreme court cases of baker v . carr ( 1962 ) and reynolds v . sims ( 1964 ) , the court ruled that the principle of " one man , one vote " needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures , and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break african americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement , including legal challenges . in 1954 , the supreme court ruled in brown v . board of education that public schools had to be desegregated , but alabama was slow to comply . during the 1960s , under governor george wallace , alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation . the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama , including the montgomery bus boycott ( 1955–1956 ) , freedom rides in 1961 , and 1965 selma to montgomery marches . these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 by the congress . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break legal segregation ended in the states in 1964 , but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court . according to the new york times , by 2017 , many of alabamas african - americans were living in alabamas cities such as birmingham and montgomery . also , the black belt region across central alabama " is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly african - american . these counties include dallas , lowndes , marengo and perry . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1972 , for the first time since 1901 , the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census . this benefited the urban areas that had developed , as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years . other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation . in the 1980s , an omnibus redistricting case , dillard v . crenshaw county , challenged the at - large voting for representative seats of 180 alabama jurisdictions , including counties and school boards . at - large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county , as the majority tended to take all seats . despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state , they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at - large jurisdictions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as part of settlement of this case , five alabama cities and counties , including chilton county , adopted a system of cumulative voting for election of representatives in multi - seat jurisdictions . this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters . in another form of proportional representation , 23 jurisdictions use limited voting , as in conecuh county . in 1982 , limited voting was first tested in conecuh county . together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices , resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beginning in the 1960s , the states economy shifted away from its traditional lumber , steel , and textile industries because of increased foreign competition . steel jobs , for instance , declined from 46314 in 1950 to 14185 in 2011 . however , the state , particularly huntsville , benefited from the opening of the george marshall space flight center in 1960 , a major facility in the development of the saturn rocket program and the space shuttle . technology and manufacturing industries , such as automobile assembly , replaced some the states older industries in the late twentieth century , but the states economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area , such as georgia and florida . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2001 , alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore installed a statue of the ten commandments in the capitol in montgomery . in 2002 , the 11th us circuit court ordered the statue removed , but moore refused to follow the court order , which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument . the monument was removed in august 2003 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a few natural disasters have occurred in the state in the twenty - first century . in 2004 , hurricane ivan , a category 3 storm upon landfall , struck the state and caused over 18 billion of damage . it was among the most destructive storms to strike the state in its modern history . a super outbreak of 62 tornadoes hit the state in april 2011 and killed 238 people , devastating many communities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alabama is the thirtieth -

as a result , urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented . it had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses , either . in reynolds v . sims ( 1964 ) , the supreme court implemented the principle of " one man , one vote " , ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses ( as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented . further , the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population , as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at that time , alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting , as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts . this had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas . for instance , birmingham and jefferson county taxes had supplied one - third of the state budget , but jefferson county received only 1 / 67th of state services in funding . through the legislative delegations , the alabama legislature kept control of county governments . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the executive branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws . it is headed by the governor of alabama . other members of the executive branch include the cabinet , the lieutenant governor of alabama , the attorney general of alabama , the alabama secretary of state , the alabama state treasurer , and the state auditor of alabama . the current governor is republican kay ivey . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the members of the legislature take office immediately after the november elections . statewide officials , such as the governor , lieutenant governor , attorney general , and other constitutional officers , take office the following january . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the judiciary is responsible for interpreting the constitution of alabama and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases . the states highest court is the supreme court of alabama . alabama uses partisan elections to select judges . since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized . the current chief justice of the alabama supreme court is republican tom parker . all sitting justices on the alabama supreme court are members of the republican party . there are two intermediate appellate courts , the court of civil appeals and the court of criminal appeals , and four trial courts : the circuit court ( trial court of general jurisdiction ) , and the district , probate , and municipal courts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some critics believe the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions . alabama has the highest per capita death penalty rate in the country . in some years , it imposes more death sentences than does texas , a state which has a population five times larger . some of its cases have been highly controversial ; the supreme court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases . it was the only state to allow judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence ; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of life imprisonment without parole that were voted unanimously by juries . this judicial authority was removed in april 2017 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break taxes are collected by the alabama department of revenue . alabama levies a 2 , 4 , or5 personal income tax , depending on the amount earned and filing status . taxpayers are allowed to deduct their federal income tax from their alabama state tax , even if taking the standard deduction ; those who itemize can also deduct fica ( the social security and medicare tax ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the states general sales tax rate is 4 . sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases . for example , the total sales tax rate in mobile county , alabama is 10 and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1 , which means a diner in mobile county , alabama would pay an 11 tax on a meal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2020 , sales and excise taxes in alabama accounted for 38 of all state and local revenue . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break only alabama , mississippi , and south dakota tax groceries at the full state sales tax rate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the corporate income tax rate in alabama is 6 . the overall federal , state , and local tax burden in alabama ranks the state as the second least tax - burdened state in the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break property taxes of . 0 of assessed value per year , are the second - lowest in the , after hawaii . the current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alabama has 67 counties . each county has its own elected legislative branch , usually called the county commission . it also has limited executive authority in the county . because of the constraints of the alabama constitution , which centralizes power in the state legislature , only seven counties ( jefferson , lee , mobile , madison , montgomery , shelby , and tuscaloosa ) in the state have limited home rule . instead , most counties in the state must lobby the local legislation committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved , ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing home rule for counties , as recommended by the 1973 alabama constitutional commission . legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county . united states supreme court decisions in baker v . carr ( 1964 ) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population , and redistricted after each census , to implement the principle of " one man , one vote " . before that , each county was represented by one state senator , leading to under - representation in the state senate for more urbanized , populous counties . the rural bias of the state legislature , which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house , affected politics well into the 20th century , failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " the lack of home rule for counties in alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution . alabamas constitution has been amended more than 700 times , and almost one - third of the amendments are local in nature , applying to only one county or city . a significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation , taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state , meaning the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol . the alabama alcoholic beverage control board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state . a total of 25 of the 67 counties are " dry counties " which ban the sale of alcohol , and there are many dry municipalities in counties which permit alcohol sales . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during reconstruction following the american civil war , alabama was occupied by federal troops of the third military district under general john pope . in 1874 , the political coalition of white democrats known as the redeemers took control of the state government from the republicans , in part by suppressing the black vote through violence , fraud , and intimidation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after 1890 , a coalition of white democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise african american residents , a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution . provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor whites . by 1941 more whites than blacks had been disenfranchised : 600000 to 520000 . the total effects were greater on the black community , as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 1901 through the 1960s , the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas . as counties were the basis of election districts , the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three - quarters of the century , until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the civil rights movement , when whites bureaucratically , and at times violently , resisted protests for electoral and social reform . governor george wallace , the states only four - term governor , was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation . only after passage of the federal civil rights act of 1964 and voting rights act of 1965 did african americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage , among other civil rights . in many jurisdictions , they continued to be excluded from representation by at - large electoral systems , which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections . some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish single - member districts that enable a more diverse representation among county boards . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2007 , the alabama legislature passed , and republican governor bob riley signed a resolution expressing " profound regret " over slavery and its lingering impact . in a symbolic ceremony , the bill was signed in the alabama state capitol , which housed congress of the confederate states of america . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2010 , republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break , there are a total of 3589839 registered voters , with 3518285 active , and the others inactive in the state . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a 2020 study , alabama was ranked as the 12th most difficult state for citizens to vote . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the disfranchisement of blacks in 1901 , the state became part of the " solid south " , a system in which the democratic party operated as effectively the only viable political party in every southern state . for nearly a hundred years local and state elections in alabama were decided in the democratic party primary , with generally only token republican challengers running in the general election . since the mid - to late 20th century , however , white conservatives started shifting to the republican party . in alabama , majority - white districts are now expected to regularly elect republican candidates to federal , state and local office . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break members of the nine seats on the supreme court of alabama and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office . until 1994 , no republicans held any of the court seats . in that general election , the then - incumbent chief justice , ernest hornsby , refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3000 votes to republican perry hooper sr . hornsby sued alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court . the democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in august 2011 with the resignation of the last democrat on the bench . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the early 21st century , republicans hold all seven of the statewide elected executive branch offices . republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the alabama state board of education . in 2010 , republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature , giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years . the last remaining statewide democrat , who served on the alabama public service commission , was defeated in 2012 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break only three republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of reconstruction , when republicans generally represented reconstruction government , including the newly emancipated freedmen who had gained the franchise . the three gop lieutenant governors are steve windom ( 1999–2003 ) , kay ivey ( 2011–2017 ) , and will ainsworth ( 2019–present ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many local offices ( county commissioners , boards of education , tax assessors , tax collectors , etcetera ) in the state are still held by democrats . many rural counties have voters who are majority democrats , resulting in local elections being decided in the democratic primary . similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority - republican and elections are effectively decided in the republican primary , although there are exceptions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alabamas 67 county sheriffs are elected in partisan , at - large races , and democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts . the current split is 35 democrats , 31 republicans , and one independent fayette . however , most of the democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties . the majority of republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban / suburban and heavily populated counties . , the state of alabama has one female sheriff , in morgan county , alabama , and ten african - american sheriffs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the states two senators are richard shelby and tommy tuberville , both of whom are republican . shelby was originally elected to the senate as a democrat in 1986 and re -

*********** Article 6: Achilles ***********

in greek mythology , achilles ( ) or achilleus was a hero of the trojan war , the greatest of all the greek warriors , and is the central character of homers iliad . he was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus , king of phthia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break achilles ' most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan prince hector outside the gates of troy . although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad , other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris , who shot him with an arrow . later legends ( beginning with statius ' unfinished epic achilleid , written in the 1st century ad ) state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel , because when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant , she held him by one of his heels . alluding to these legends , the term " achilles ' heel " has come to mean a point of weakness , especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution . the achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break linear b tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms a - ki - re - u and a - ki - re - we , the latter being the dative of the former . and was also turned into the female form ἀχιλλεία ( achilleía ) , attested in attica in the fourth century bc ( ig ii² 1617 ) and , in the form achillia , on a stele in halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an " amazon " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break achilles ' name can be analyzed as a combination of ἄχος ( áchos ) " distress , pain , sorrow , grief " and λαός ( laós ) " people , soldiers , nation " , resulting in a proto - form akhí - lāu̯os " he who has the people distressed " or " he whose people have distress " . the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the iliad ( and frequently by achilles himself ) . achilles ' role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of κλέος kléos ( " glory " , usually in war ) . furthermore , laós has been construed by gregory nagy , following leonard palmer , to mean " a corps of soldiers " , a muster . with this derivation , the name obtains a double meaning in the poem : when the hero is functioning rightly , his men bring distress to the enemy , but when wrongly , his men get the grief of war . the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some researchers deem the name a loan word , possibly from a pre - greek language . robert beekes has suggested a pre - greek origin of the name , based among other things on the coexistence of - λλ - and - λ - in epic language , which may account for a palatalized phoneme / ly / in the original language . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break achilles was the son of the thetis , a nereid , and peleus , the king of the myrmidons . zeus and poseidon had been rivals for thetiss hand in marriage until prometheus , the fore - thinker , warned zeus of a prophecy ( originally uttered by themis , goddess of divine law ) that thetis would bear a son greater than his father . for this reason , the two gods withdrew their pursuit , and had her wed peleus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events : in the argonautica ( 4 ) zeus ' sister and wife hera alludes to thetis ' chaste resistance to the advances of zeus , pointing out that thetis was so loyal to heras marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods . thetis , although a daughter of the sea - god nereus , was also brought up by hera , further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus . zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to the achilleid , written by statius in the 1st century ad , and to non - surviving previous sources , when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river styx ; however , he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him : his left heel ( see achilles ' heel , achilles ' tendon ) . it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier . in another version of this story , thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body . she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break none of the sources before statius make any reference to this general invulnerability . to the contrary , in the iliad , homer mentions achilles being wounded : in book 21 the paeonian hero asteropaeus , son of pelagon , challenged achilles by the river scamander . he was ambidextrous , and cast a spear from each hand ; one grazed achilles ' elbow , " drawing a spurt of blood " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the few fragmentary poems of the epic cycle which describe the heros death ( that is the cypria , the little iliad by lesches of pyrrha , the aithiopis and iliou persis by arctinus of miletus ) , there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel . in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles , the arrow ( or in many cases , arrows ) hit his torso . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur , who lived on mount pelion , to be reared . thetis foretold that her sons fate was either to gain glory and die young , or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity . achilles chose the former , and decided to take part in the trojan war . according to homer , achilles grew up in phthia with his companion patroclus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to photius , the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by peleus . when she had achilles , peleus noticed , tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot , and confided him to the centaur chiron . later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus , who was the fastest of all the giants , removed the ankle , and incorporated it into achilles ' burnt foot . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break among the appellations under which achilles is generally known are the following : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " it is said . . . that he ' ( achilles ) ' was called podarkes ( podarces , swift - footed ) by the poet ' homer ' , because , it is said , thetis gave the newborn child the wings of arke ( arce ) and podarkes means that his feet had the wings of arke . and arke was the daughter of thaumas and her sister was iris ; both had wings , but , during the struggle of the gods against the titanes ( titans ) , arke flew out of the camp of the gods and joined the titanes . after the victory zeus removed her wings before throwing her into tartaros and , when he came to the wedding of peleus and thetis , he brought these wings as a gift for thetis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some post - homeric sources claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war , thetis ( or , in some versions , peleus ) hid the young man at the court of lycomedes , king of skyros . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there , achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among lycomedes ' daughters , perhaps under the name " pyrrha " ( the red - haired girl ) , cercysera or aissa ( " swift " ) . with lycomedes ' daughter deidamia , whom in the account of statius he raped , achilles there fathered two sons , neoptolemus ( also called pyrrhus , after his fathers possible alias ) and oneiros . according to this story , odysseus learned from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles ' aid . odysseus went to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling womens clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods . when achilles instantly took up the spear , odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the greek campaign . in another version of the story , odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes ' women . while the women fled in panic , achilles prepared to defend the court , thus giving his identity away . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to the iliad , achilles arrived at troy with 50 ships , each carrying 50 myrmidons . he appointed five leaders ( each leader commanding 500 myrmidons ) : menesthius , eudorus , peisander , phoenix and alcimedon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when the greeks left for the trojan war , they accidentally stopped in mysia , ruled by king telephus . in the resulting battle , achilles gave telephus a wound that would not heal ; telephus consulted an oracle , who stated that " he that wounded shall heal " . guided by the oracle , he arrived at argos , where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to other reports in euripides ' lost play about telephus , he went to aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound . achilles refused , claiming to have no medical knowledge . alternatively , telephus held orestes for ransom , the ransom being achilles ' aid in healing the wound . odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound ; therefore , the spear must be able to heal it . pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to the cypria ( the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles ' wrath ) , when the achaeans desired to return home , they were restrained by achilles , who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas , sacked neighbouring cities ( like pedasus and lyrnessus , where the greeks capture the queen briseis ) and killed tenes , a son of apollo , as well as priams son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo thymbraios ; however , the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucers troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeares troilus and cressida is a medieval invention . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in dares phrygius ' account of the destruction of troy , the latin summary through which the story of achilles was transmitted to medieval europe , as well as in older accounts , troilus was a young trojan prince , the youngest of king priams and hecubas five legitimate sons ( or according other sources , another son of apollo ) . despite his youth , he was one of the main trojan war leaders , a " horse fighter " or " chariot fighter " according to homer . prophecies linked troilus ' fate to that of troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him . yet achilles , struck by the beauty of both troilus and his sister polyxena , and overcome with lust , directed his sexual attentions on the youth– who , refusing to yield , instead found himself decapitated upon an altar - omphalos of apollo thymbraios . later versions of the story suggested troilus was accidentally killed by achilles in an over - ardent lovers ' embrace . in this version of the myth , achilles ' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege . ancient writers treated troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents . had troilus lived to adulthood , the first vatican mythographer claimed , troy would have been invincible ; however , the motif is older and found already in plautus ' bacchides . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break homers iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles ' deeds in the trojan war . achilles ' wrath ( μῆνις ἀχιλλέως , mênis achilléōs ) is the central theme of the poem . the first two lines of the iliad read : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break οὐλομένην , ἣ μυρί ' ἀχαιοῖς ἄλγε ' ἔθηκε , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the achaeans , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade - long war , and does not narrate achilles ' death . it begins with achilles ' withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon , the commander of the achaean forces . agamemnon has taken a woman named chryseis as his slave . her father chryses , a priest of apollo , begs agamemnon to return her to him . agamemnon refuses , and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks . the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him . achilles does so , and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father . agamemnon consents , but then commands that achilles ' battle prize briseis , the daughter of briseus , be brought to him to replace chryseis . angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away ( and , as he says later , because he loves briseis ) , with the urging of his mother thetis , achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces . at the same time , burning with rage over agamemnons theft , achilles prays to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war , so that he may regain his honour . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as the battle turns against the greeks , thanks to the influence of zeus , nestor declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles , and urges the king to appease the warrior . agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains , ajax and phoenix . they promise that , if achilles returns to battle , agamemnon will return the captive briseis and other gifts . achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the trojans , led by hector , subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships . with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction , patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle , wearing achilles ' armour , though achilles remains at his camp . patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches , but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus , the son of nestor , achilles grieves over his beloved companions death . his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles . she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him , in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing , which was taken by hector . the new armour includes the shield of achilles , described in great detail in the poem . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break enraged over the death of patroclus , achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field , killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector . achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander , who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed . the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus . zeus himself takes note of achilles ' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction , seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself . finally , achilles finds his prey . achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena , in the form of hectors favorite and dearest brother , deiphobus , persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face . after hector realizes the trick , he knows the battle is inevitable . wanting to go down fighting , he charges at achilles with his only weapon , his sword , but misses . accepting his fate , hector begs achilles not to spare his life , but to treat his body with respect after killing him . achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him , declaring that " my rage , my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me " . achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot . after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral , achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the onset of his duel with hector , achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky , which comes on in the autumn , orions dog ( sirius ) ; a sign of evil . during the cremation of patroclus , he is compared to hesperus , the evening / western star ( venus ) , while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until phosphorus , the morning / eastern star ( also venus ) has set ( descended ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the assistance of the god hermes ( argeiphontes ) , hectors father priam goes to achilles ' tent to plead with achilles for the return of hectors body so that he can be buried . achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral , lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th ( in the tradition of niobes offspring ) . the poem ends with a description of hectors funeral , with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aethiopis ( 7th century bc ) and a work named posthomerica , composed by quintus of smyrna in the fourth century ce , relate further events from the trojan war . when penthesilea , queen of the amazons and daughter of ares , arrives in troy , priam hopes that she will defeat achilles . after his temporary truce with priam , achilles fights and kills the warrior queen , only to grieve over her death later . at first , he was so distracted by her beauty , he did not fight as intensely as usual . once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life , he refocused and killed her . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following the death of patroclus , nestors son antilochus becomes achilles ' closest companion . when memnon , son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia , slays antilochus , achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield , killing memnon . consequently , eos will not let the sun rise until zeus persuades her . the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus , except that memnon ( unlike hector ) was also the son of a goddess . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the iliads description of the death of patroclus and achilles ' reaction to it . the episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic aethiopis , which was composed after the iliad , possibly in the 7th century bc . the aethiopis is now lost , except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the exact nature of achilles ' relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times . in the iliad , it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship . homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus had sexual relations . although there is no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers , this theory was expressed by some later authors . commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures . in 5th - century bce athens , the intense bond was often viewed in light of the greek custom of paiderasteia . in platos symposium , the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a couple ; phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the lover . however , ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual , and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women . many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to achilles and patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the death of achilles , even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources , is a complex one , with many different versions . in the oldest version , the iliad , and as predicted by hector with his dying breath , the heros death was brought about by paris with an arrow ( to the heel according to statius ) . in some versions , the god apollo guided paris ' arrow . some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow . all of these versions deny paris any sort of valour , owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was , and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after death , achilles ' bones were mingled with those of patroclus , and funeral games were held . he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another version of achilles ' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses , polyxena . achilles asks priam for polyxenas hand in marriage . priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the worlds greatest warrior . but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles , paris , who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister , hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow , killing him . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the odyssey , agamemnon informs achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in hades . he claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean . achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patroclus . paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in book 11 of homers odyssey , odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades . one of these is achilles , who when greeted as " blessed in life , blessed in death " , responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead . but achilles then asks odysseus of his sons exploits in the trojan war , and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus ' heroic actions , achilles is filled with satisfaction . this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to some accounts , he had married medea in life , so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysian fields of hades– as hera promised thetis in apollonius ' argonautica ( 3rd century bc ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break achilles ' armour was the object of a feud between odysseus and telamonian ajax ( ajax the greater ) . they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners , who , after considering both mens presentations , decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour . furious , ajax cursed odysseus , which earned him the ire of athena , who temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep , thinking them his comrades . after a while , when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep , he was so ashamed that he committed suicide . odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus , the son of achilles . when odysseus encounters the shade of ajax much later in the house of hades ( odyssey 11–566 ) , ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to odysseus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a relic claimed to be achilles ' bronze - headed spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis , lycia , a port on the pamphylian gulf . the city was visited in 333 bce by alexander the great , who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him , but his court biographers do not mention the spear ; however , it was shown in the time of pausanias in the 2nd century ce . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions . at some point in the war , achilles and ajax were playing a board game ( petteia ) . they were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle . the trojans attacked and reached the heroes , who were saved only by an intervention of athena . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the tomb of achilles , extant throughout antiquity in troad , was venerated by thessalians , but also by persian expeditionary forces , as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla . achilles ' cult was also to be found at other places , e . g . on the island of astypalaea in the sporades , in sparta which had a sanctuary , in elis and in achilles ' homeland thessaly , as well as in the magna graecia cities of tarentum , locri and croton , accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the cult of achilles is illustrated in the 500 bce polyxena sarcophagus , which depicts the sacrifice of polyxena near the tumulus of achilles . 2 ) also suggested that such a cult of achilles existed in troad : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the spread and intensity of the heros veneration among the greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus , todays black sea , appears to have been remarkable . an archaic cult is attested for the milesian colony of olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea , today identified with snake island ( ukrainian зміїний , zmiinyi , near kiliya , ukraine ) . early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea ( graffiti and inscribed clay disks , these possibly being votive offerings , from olbia , the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese ) attest the existence of a heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards . the cult was still thriving in the third century ce , when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles pontárchēs ( ποντάρχης , roughly " lord of the sea , " or " of the pontus euxinus " ) , who was invoked as a protector of the city of olbia , venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates , hermes agoraeus , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pliny the elder ( 23–79 ad ) in his natural history mentions a " port of the achæi " and an " island of achilles " , famous for the tomb of that " man " ( portus achaeorum , insula achillis , tumulo eius viri clara ) , situated somewhat nearby olbia and the dnieper - bug estuary ; furthermore , at 125roman miles from this island , he places a peninsula " which stretches forth in the shape of a sword " obliquely , called dromos achilleos ( ἀχιλλέως δρόμος , achilléōs drómos " the race - course of achilles " ) and considered the place of the heros exercise or of games instituted by him . this last feature of plinys account is considered to be the iconic spit , called today tendra ( or kosa tendra and kosa djarilgatch ) , situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay , but which is hardly 125roman miles ( c . 185km ) away from the dnieper - bug estuary , as pliny states .

" in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc , a statue is dedicated to achilles , lord of leuke , by a citizen of olbia , while in a further dedication , the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the islands cult , again suggesting its quality as a place of a supra - regional hero veneration . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which , after his untimely death , thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical λεύκη νῆσος ( leúkē nêsos " white island " ) . already in the fifth century bc , pindar had mentioned a cult of achilles on a " bright island " ( φαεννά νᾶσος , phaenná nâsos ) of the black sea , while in another of his works , pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmus . well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles ( μακαρῶν νῆσοι , makárôn nêsoi ) or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world , which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it . and the opposition of north and south , as evoked by achilles ' fight against the aethiopian prince memnon , who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the periplus of the euxine sea ( c . 130 ad ) gives the following details : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the greek geographer dionysius periegetes , who likely lived during the first century ce , wrote that the island was called leuce " because the wild animals which live there are white . it is said that there , in leuce island , reside the souls of achilles and other heroes , and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island ; this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues , because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour " . similarly , others relate the islands name to its white cliffs , snakes or birds dwelling there . pausanias has been told that the island is " covered with forests and full of animals , some wild , some tame . in this island there is also achilles ' temple and his statue " . leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing . pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of croton to be cured of a chest wound . ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters ( aquae ) on the island . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles . herodotus , pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of a town achílleion ( ἀχίλλειον ) , built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc , close to the heros presumed burial mound in the troad . nicolae densuşianu recognized a connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta , called chilia ( presumably from an older achileii ) , though his conclusion , that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea , evokes modern rather than archaic sea - law . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the kings of epirus claimed to be descended from achilles through his son , neoptolemus . alexander the great , son of the epirote princess olympias , could therefore also claim this descent , and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor . he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion while passing troy . in ad 216 the roman emperor caracalla , while on his way to war against parthia , emulated alexander by holding games around achilles ' tumulus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the greek tragedian aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles , given the title achilleis by modern scholars . the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war , including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris and guided by apollo punctures his heel . extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play . the first part of the achilleis trilogy , the myrmidons , focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus , who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with agamemnon ; only a few lines survive today . in platos symposium , phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the beloved ; phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles , being the younger and more beautiful of the two , was the beloved , who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles , a play with achilles as the main character . only a few fragments survive . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break towards the end of the 5th century bce , a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek drama ;

*********** Article 7: Abraham Lincoln ***********

abraham lincoln ( ; february 12 , 1809– april 15 , 1865 ) was an american lawyer and statesman who served as the 16th president of the united states from 1861 until his assassination in 1865 . lincoln led the nation through the american civil war and succeeded in preserving the union , abolishing slavery , bolstering the federal government , and modernizing the economy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in kentucky and was raised on the frontier , primarily in indiana . he was self - educated and became a lawyer , whig party leader , illinois state legislator , and congressman from illinois . in 1849 , he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to slavery as a result of the kansas–nebraska act of 1854 . he reentered politics in 1854 , becoming a leader in the new republican party , and he reached a national audience in the 1858 senate campaign debates against stephen douglas . lincoln ran for president in 1860 , sweeping the north to gain victory . pro - slavery elements in the south viewed his election as a threat to slavery , and southern states began seceding from the union . during this time the newly formed confederate states of america began seizing federal military bases in the south . just over one month after lincoln assumed the presidency , the confederate states attacked fort sumter , a fort in south carolina . following the bombardment , lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln , a moderate republican , had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the democratic and republican parties . his allies , the war democrats and the radical republicans , demanded harsh treatment of the southern confederates . anti - war democrats ( called " copperheads " ) despised lincoln , and irreconcilable pro - confederate elements plotted his assassination . he managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity , carefully distributing political patronage , and by appealing to the american people . his gettysburg address appealed to nationalistic , republican , egalitarian , libertarian , and democratic sentiments . lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort , including the selection of generals , and implemented a naval blockade of the souths trade . he suspended habeas corpus in maryland , and he averted british intervention by defusing the trent affair . in 1863 he issued the emancipation proclamation , which declared the slaves in the states " in rebellion " to be free . it also directed the army and navy to " recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons " and to receive them " into the armed service of the united states . " lincoln also pressured border states to outlaw slavery , and he promoted the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution , which upon its ratification abolished slavery . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln managed his own successful re - election campaign . he sought to heal the war - torn nation through reconciliation . on april 14 , 1865 , just days after the wars end at appomattox , he was attending a play at fords theatre in washington , , with his wife mary when he was fatally shot by confederate sympathizer john wilkes booth . abraham lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the union and abolish slavery . lincoln is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in american history . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break abraham lincoln was born on february 12 , 1809 , the second child of thomas lincoln and nancy hanks lincoln , in a log cabin on sinking spring farm near hodgenville , kentucky . he was a descendant of samuel lincoln , an englishman who migrated from hingham , norfolk , to its namesake , hingham , massachusetts , in 1638 . the family then migrated west , passing through new jersey , pennsylvania , and virginia . lincolns paternal grandparents , his namesake captain abraham lincoln and wife bathsheba ( née herring ) moved the family from virginia to jefferson county , kentucky . the captain was killed in an indian raid in 1786 . his children , including eight - year - old thomas , abrahams father , witnessed the attack . thomas then worked at odd jobs in kentucky and tennessee before the family settled in hardin county , kentucky , in the early 1800s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the heritage of lincolns mother nancy remains unclear , but it is widely assumed that she was the daughter of lucy hanks . thomas and nancy married on june 12 , 1806 , in washington county , and moved to elizabethtown , kentucky . they had three children : sarah , abraham , and thomas , who died as an infant . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break thomas lincoln bought or leased farms in kentucky before losing all but 200 acre of his land in court disputes over property titles . in 1816 , the family moved to indiana where the land surveys and titles were more reliable . indiana was a " free " ( non - slaveholding ) territory , and they settled in an " unbroken forest " in hurricane township , perry county , indiana . in 1860 , lincoln noted that the familys move to indiana was " partly on account of slavery " , but mainly due to land title difficulties . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in kentucky and indiana , thomas worked as a farmer , cabinetmaker , and carpenter . at various times , he owned farms , livestock , and town lots , paid taxes , sat on juries , appraised estates , and served on county patrols . thomas and nancy were members of a separate baptists church , which forbade alcohol , dancing , and slavery . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break overcoming financial challenges , thomas in 1827 obtained clear title to 80 acre in indiana , an area which became the little pigeon creek community . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on october 5 , 1818 , nancy lincoln died from milk sickness , leaving 11 - year - old sarah in charge of a household including her father , 9 - year - old abraham , and nancys 19 - year - old orphan cousin , dennis hanks . ten years later , on january 20 , 1828 , sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son , devastating lincoln . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on december 2 , 1819 , thomas married sarah bush johnston , a widow from elizabethtown , kentucky , with three children of her own . abraham became close to his stepmother and called her " mother " . lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life . his family even said he was lazy , for all his " reading , scribbling , writing , ciphering , writing poetry , etcetera " . his stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy " physical labor " , but loved to read . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln was largely self - educated . his formal schooling was from itinerant teachers . it included two short stints in kentucky , where he learned to read but probably not to write , at age seven , and in indiana , where he went to school sporadically due to farm chores , for a total of less than 12 months in aggregate by the age of 15 . he persisted as an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning . family , neighbors , and schoolmates recalled that his reading included the king james bible , aesops fables , john bunyans the pilgrims progress , daniel defoes robinson crusoe , and the autobiography of benjamin franklin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a teen , lincoln took responsibility for chores and customarily gave his father all earnings from work outside the home until he was 21 . lincoln was tall , strong , and athletic , and became adept at using an ax . he was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough catch - as - catch - can style ( also known as catch wrestling ) . he became county wrestling champion at the age of 21 . he gained a reputation for strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of ruffians known as " the clarys grove boys " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in march 1830 , fearing another milk sickness outbreak , several members of the extended lincoln family , including abraham , moved west to illinois , a free state , and settled in macon county . abraham then became increasingly distant from thomas , in part due to his fathers lack of education . in 1831 , as thomas and other family prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county , illinois , abraham struck out on his own . he made his home in new salem , illinois , for six years . lincoln and some friends took goods by flatboat to new orleans , louisiana , where he was first exposed to slavery . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1865 , lincoln was asked how he came to acquire his rhetorical skills . he answered that in the practice of law he frequently came across the word " demonstrate " but had insufficient understanding of the term . so , he left springfield for his fathers home to study until he " could give any proposition in the six books of euclid ' referencing ' , " euclids " , " elements " at sight . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincolns first romantic interest was ann rutledge , whom he met when he moved to new salem . by 1835 , they were in a relationship but not formally engaged . she died on august 25 , 1835 , most likely of typhoid fever . in the early 1830s , he met mary owens from kentucky . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break late in 1836 , lincoln agreed to a match with owens if she returned to new salem . owens arrived that november and he courted her for a time ; however , they both had second thoughts . on august 16 , 1837 , he wrote owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship , and she never replied . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1839 , lincoln met mary todd in springfield , illinois , and the following year they became engaged . she was the daughter of robert smith todd , a wealthy lawyer and businessman in lexington , kentucky . a wedding set for january 1 , 1841 , was canceled at lincolns request , but they reconciled and married on november 4 , 1842 , in the springfield mansion of marys sister . while anxiously preparing for the nuptials , he was asked where he was going and replied , " to hell , i suppose . " in 1844 , the couple bought a house in springfield near his law office . mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons , though his work regularly kept him away from home . the oldest , robert todd lincoln , was born in 1843 and was the only child to live to maturity . edward baker lincoln ( eddie ) , born in 1846 , died february 1 , 1850 , probably of tuberculosis . lincolns third son , " willie " lincoln was born on december 21 , 1850 , and died of a fever at the white house on february 20 , 1862 . the youngest , thomas " tad " lincoln , was born on april 4 , 1853 , and survived his father but died of heart failure at age 18 on july 16 , 1871 . lincoln " was remarkably fond of children " and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own . in fact , lincolns law partner william herndon would grow irritated when lincoln would bring his children to the law office . their father , it seemed , was often too absorbed in his work to notice his childrens behavior . herndon recounted , " i have felt many and many a time that i wanted to wring their little necks , and yet out of respect for lincoln i kept my mouth shut . lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the deaths of their sons , eddie and willie , had profound effects on both parents . lincoln suffered from " melancholy " , a condition now thought to be clinical depression . later in life , mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons , and robert committed her for a time to an asylum in 1875 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when lincoln returned home from the black hawk war , he planned to become a blacksmith . he didnt , but he formed a partnership with william berry , 21 , with whom he purchased a general store on credit in new salem , illinois . because a license was required to sell customers single beverages , berry obtained bartending licenses for 7 each for lincoln and himself , and in 1833 the store became a tavern as well . as licensed bartenders , lincoln and berry were able to sell spirits , including liquor , for 12 cents a pint . they offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food , including takeout dinners . but berry became an alcoholic , was often too drunk to work , and lincoln ended up running the store by himself . although the economy was booming , the business struggled and went into debt , causing lincoln to sell his share . that march he entered politics , running for the illinois general assembly , advocating navigational improvements on the sangamon river . he could draw crowds as a raconteur , but he lacked the requisite formal education , powerful friends , and money , and lost the election . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln briefly interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the illinois militia during the black hawk war . in his first campaign speech after returning , he observed a supporter in the crowd under attack , grabbed the assailant by his " neck and the seat of his trousers " , and tossed him . lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates ( the top four were elected ) , though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the new salem precinct . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln served as new salems postmaster and later as county surveyor , but continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer . rather than studying in the office of an established attorney , as was the custom , lincoln borrowed legal texts from attorneys john todd stuart and thomas drummond , purchased books including blackstones commentaries and chittys pleadings , and read law on his own . he later said of his legal education that " i studied with nobody . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincolns second state house campaign in 1834 , this time as a whig , was a success over a powerful whig opponent . then followed his four terms in the illinois house of representatives for sangamon county . he championed construction of the illinois and michigan canal , and later was a canal commissioner . he voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males , but adopted a " free soil " stance opposing both slavery and abolition . in 1837 , he declared , " the institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy , but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils . " he echoed henry clays support for the american colonization society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in liberia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he was admitted to the illinois bar in 1836 , and moved to springfield and began to practice law under john stuart , mary todds cousin . lincoln emerged as a formidable trial combatant during cross - examinations and closing arguments . he partnered several years with stephen logan , and in 1844 began his practice with william herndon , " a studious young man " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break true to his record , lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be " an old line whig , a disciple of henry clay " . their party favored economic modernization in banking , tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads , and urbanization . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1843 , lincoln sought the whig nomination for illinois ' 7th district seat in the house of representatives ; he was defeated by john hardin though he prevailed with the party in limiting hardin to one term . lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in 1846 but also won the election . he was the only whig in the illinois delegation , but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line . he was assigned to the committee on post office and post roads and the committee on expenditures in the war department . lincoln teamed with joshua giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners , enforcement to capture fugitive slaves , and a popular vote on the matter . he dropped the bill when it eluded whig support . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on foreign and military policy , lincoln spoke against the mexican–american war , which he imputed to president james polks desire for " military glory—that attractive rainbow , that rises in showers of blood " . he supported the wilmot proviso , a failed proposal to ban slavery in any territory won from mexico . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions . the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico , and polk insisted that mexican soldiers had " invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow - citizens on our own soil " . lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil . the resolution was ignored in both congress and the national papers , and it cost lincoln political support in his district . one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him " spotty lincoln " . lincoln later regretted some of his statements , especially his attack on presidential war - making powers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the house . realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency , he supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election . taylor won and lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed commissioner of the general land office . the administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the oregon territory as consolation . this distant territory was a democratic stronghold , and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in illinois , so he declined and resumed his law practice . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his springfield practice , lincoln handled " every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer " . twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the midstate county courts ; this continued for 16 years . lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nations western expansion , particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges . as a riverboat man , lincoln initially favored those interests , but ultimately represented whoever hired him . he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in hurd v . rock island bridge company , a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge . in 1849 , he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water . the idea was never commercialized , but it made lincoln the only president to hold a patent . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases ; he was sole counsel in 51 cases , of which 31 were decided in his favor . from 1853 to 1860 , one of his largest clients was the illinois central railroad . his legal reputation gave rise to the nickname " honest abe " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln argued in an 1858 criminal trial , defending william " duff " armstrong , who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker . the case is famous for lincolns use of a fact established by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness . after an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight , lincoln produced a farmers ' almanac showing the moon was at a low angle , drastically reducing visibility . armstrong was acquitted . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break leading up to his presidential campaign , lincoln elevated his profile in an 1859 murder case , with his defense of simeon quinn " peachy " harrison who was a third cousin ; harrison was also the grandson of lincolns political opponent , rev . peter cartwright . harrison was charged with the murder of greek crafton who , as he lay dying of his wounds , confessed to cartwright that he had provoked harrison . lincoln angrily protested the judges initial decision to exclude cartwrights testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay . lincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule . instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as expected , the judge , a democrat , reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence , resulting in harrisons acquittal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave - holding south and the free north , with the failure of the compromise of 1850 , a legislative package designed to address the issue . in his 1852 eulogy for clay , lincoln highlighted the latters support for gradual emancipation and opposition to " both extremes " on the slavery issue . as the slavery debate in the nebraska and kansas territories became particularly acrimonious , illinois senator stephen douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise ; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery . the legislation alarmed many northerners , who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result , but douglass kansas–nebraska act narrowly passed congress in may 1854 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his " peoria speech " of october 1854 . lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery , which he repeated en route to the presidency . he said the kansas act had a " declared indifference , but as i must think , a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery . i cannot but hate it . i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself . i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world " lincolns attacks on the kansas–nebraska act marked his return to political life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nationally , the whigs were irreparably split by the kansas–nebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue . reflecting on the demise of his party , lincoln wrote in 1855 , " i think i am a whig , but others say there are no whigs , and that i am an abolitionist . i do no more than oppose the extension of slavery . " the new republican party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery , drawing from the antislavery wing of the whig party and combining free soil , liberty , and antislavery democratic party members , lincoln resisted early republican entreaties , fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists . lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the whigs , though he lamented his partys growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1854 , lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat . the years elections showed the strong opposition to the kansas–nebraska act , and in the aftermath , lincoln sought election to the united states senate . at that time , senators were elected by the state legislature . after leading in the first six rounds of voting , he was unable to obtain a majority . lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull . trumbull was an antislavery democrat , and had received few votes in the earlier ballots ; his supporters , also antislavery democrats , had vowed not to support any whig . lincolns decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbulls antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate , joel aldrich matteson . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break violent political confrontations in kansas continued , and opposition to the kansas–nebraska act remained strong throughout the north . as the 1856 elections approached , lincoln joined the republicans and attended the bloomington convention , which formally established the illinois republican party . the convention platform endorsed congresss right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of kansas as a free state . lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the union . at the june 1856 republican national convention , though lincoln received support to run as vice president , john frémont and william dayton comprised the ticket , which lincoln supported throughout illinois . the democrats nominated former secretary of state james buchanan and the know - nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore . buchanan prevailed , while republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois , and lincoln became a leading republican in illinois . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break dred scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a free territory under the missouri compromise . after scott was returned to the slave state he petitioned a federal court for his freedom . his petition was denied in dred scott v . sandford ( 1857 ) . supreme court chief justice roger taney in the decision wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution . while many democrats hoped that dred scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories , the decision sparked further outrage in the north . lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power . he argued the decision was at variance with the declaration of independence ; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect , they believed all men were equal " in certain inalienable rights , among which are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1858 , douglas was up for re - election in the senate , and lincoln hoped to defeat him . many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in 1858 , and lincolns 1856 campaigning and support of trumbull had earned him a favor . some eastern republicans supported douglas for his opposition to the lecompton constitution and admission of kansas as a slave state . many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference . for the first time , illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate , and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal . after his nomination he delivered his house divided speech , with the biblical reference mark 3 : 25 , " a house divided against itself cannot stand . i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free . i do not expect the union to be dissolved—i do not expect the house to fall—but i do expect it will cease to be divided . it will become all one thing , or all the other . " the speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion . the stage was then set for the election of the illinois legislature which would , in turn , select lincoln or douglas . when informed of lincolns nomination , douglas stated , " lincoln is the strong man of the party and if i beat him , my victory will be hardly won . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the senate campaign featured seven debates between lincoln and douglas . these were the most famous political debates in american history ; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands . the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically . lincoln warned that douglas ' " slave power " was threatening the values of republicanism , and accused douglas of distorting the founding fathers ' premise that all men are created equal . douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine , that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists . lincolns argument assumed a moral tone , as he claimed douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery . douglass argument was more legal , claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the supreme court in the dred scott decision . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes , the democrats won more seats , and the legislature re - elected douglas . lincolns articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence . in may 1859 , lincoln purchased the illinois staats - anzeiger , a german - language newspaper that was consistently supportive ; most of the states 130000 german americans voted democratically but the german - language paper mobilized republican support . in the aftermath of the 1858 election , newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate , rivaled by william seward , salmon chase , edward bates , and simon cameron . while lincoln was popular in the midwest , he lacked support in the northeast and was unsure whether to seek office . in january 1860 , lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered , and in the following months ' several local papers endorsed his candidacy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break over the coming months , lincoln was tireless , making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail . by the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric , he quickly became the champion of the republican party . however , despite his overwhelming support in the midwestern united states , he was less appreciated in the east . horace greeley , editor of the new york tribune , at that time wrote up an unflattering account of lincolns compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the courts dred - scott ruling , which was promptly used against him by his political rivals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on february 27 , 1860 , powerful new york republicans invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union , in which he argued that the founding fathers of the united states had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery . he insisted that morality required opposition to slavery , and rejected any " groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong " . many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly . but lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention . journalist noah brooks reported , " no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break historian david herbert donald described the speech as a " superb political move for an unannounced candidate , to appear in one rivals ( seward ) own state at an event sponsored by the second rivals ( chase ) loyalists , while not mentioning either by name during its delivery " . in response to an inquiry about his ambitions , lincoln said , " the taste is in my mouth a little . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on may 9–10 , 1860 , the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur . lincolns followers organized a campaign team led by david davis , norman judd , leonard swett , and jesse dubois , and lincoln received his first endorsement . exploiting his embellished frontier legend ( clearing land and splitting fence rails ) , lincolns supporters adopted the label of " the rail candidate " . in 1860 , lincoln described himself : " i am in height , six feet , four inches , nearly ; lean in flesh , weighing , on an average , one hundred and eighty pounds ; dark complexion , with coarse black hair , and gray eyes . " michael martinez wrote about the effective imaging of lincoln by his campaign . at times he was presented as the plain - talking " rail splitter " and at other times he was " honest abe " , unpolished but trustworthy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on may 18 , at the republican national convention in chicago , lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot , beating candidates such as seward and chase . a former democrat , hannibal hamlin of maine , was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket . lincolns success depended on his campaign team , his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue , and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pennsylvania put him over the top , led by the states iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support . lincolns managers had focused on this delegation while honoring lincolns dictate to " make no contracts that will bind me " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as the slave power tightened its grip on the national government , most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party . throughout the 1850s , lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war , and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession . when douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats , delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the democratic convention ; they opposed douglass position on popular sovereignty , and selected incumbent vice president john breckinridge as their candidate . a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee . lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north , while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break prior to the republican convention , the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization , the wide awakes , which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives , thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties . people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as douglas and the other candidates campaigned , lincoln gave no speeches , relying on the enthusiasm of the republican party . the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north and produced an abundance of campaign posters , leaflets , and newspaper editorials . republican speakers focused first on the party platform , and second on lincolns life story , emphasizing his childhood poverty . the goal was to demonstrate the power of " free labor " , which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts . the republican partys production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition ; a chicago tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincolns life and sold 100000–200000 copies . though he did not give public appearances , many sought to visit him and write him . in the runup to the election , he took an office in the illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention . he also hired john george nicolay as his personal secretary , who would remain in that role during the presidency . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on november 6 , 1860 , lincoln was elected the 16th president . he was the first republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west . no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 southern slave states , and he won only two of 996 counties in all the southern states , an omen of the impending civil war . lincoln received 1866452 votes , or 39 of the total in a four - way race , carrying the free northern states , as well as california and oregon . his victory in the electoral college was decisive : lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the south was outraged by lincolns election , and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the union before he took office in march 1861 . on december 20 , 1860 , south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession ; by february 1 , 1861 , florida , mississippi , alabama , georgia , louisiana , and texas followed . six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation , the confederate states of america , and adopted a constitution . the upper south and border states ( delaware , maryland , virginia , north carolina , tennessee , kentucky , missouri , and arkansas ) initially rejected the secessionist appeal . president buchanan and president - elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy , declaring secession illegal . the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february 9 , 1861 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break attempts at compromise followed but lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the partys platform of free - soil in the territories . lincoln said , " i will suffer death before i consent to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln tacitly supported the corwin amendment to the constitution , which passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when lincoln took office . that doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed . a few weeks before the war , lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break en route to his inauguration , lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north . he gave a particularly emotional farewell address upon leaving springfield ; he would never again return to springfield alive . the president - elect evaded suspected assassins in baltimore . on february 23 , 1861 , he arrived in disguise in washington , , which was placed under substantial military guard . lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south , proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between north and south , stating " one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended , while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended . this is the only substantial dispute . " the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south : " we are not enemies , but friends . we must not be enemies the mystic chords of memory , stretching from every battlefield , and patriot grave , to every living heart and hearthstone , all over this broad land , will yet swell the chorus of the union , when again touched , as surely they will be , by the better angels of our nature . " the failure of the peace conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible . by march 1861 , no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms meanwhile , lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated . in his second inaugural address , lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said : " both parties deprecated war , but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive , and the other would accept war rather than let it perish , and the war came . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break major robert anderson , commander of the unions fort sumter in charleston , south carolina , sent a request for provisions to washington , and lincolns order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war . on april 12 , 1861 , confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight . historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations : underestimating the gravity of the crisis , exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south , and overlooking southern unionist opposition to an invasion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was " sadly disappointed " at his failure to realize that " the country was sleeping on a volcano " and that the south was preparing for war . donald concludes that , " his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft . sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood . but he also vowed not to surrender the forts . the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot ; they did just that . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on april 15 , lincoln called on the states to send a total of 75000 volunteer troops to recapture forts , protect washington , and " preserve the union " , which , in his view , remained intact despite the seceding states . this call forced states to choose sides . virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of richmond as the confederate capital , despite its exposure to union lines . north carolina , tennessee , and arkansas followed over the following two months . secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland , but did not prevail ; kentucky remained neutral . the fort sumter attack rallied americans north of the mason - dixon line to defend the nation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as states sent union regiments south , on april 19 , baltimore mobs in control of the rail links attacked union troops who were changing trains . local leaders ' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the army responded by arresting local maryland officials . lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus where needed for the security of troops trying to reach washington . john merryman , one maryland official hindering the troop movements , petitioned supreme court chief justice roger taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus . in june taney , ruling only for the lower circuit court in ex parte merryman , issued the writ which he felt could only be suspended by congress . lincoln persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the union military strategy . he responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander - in - chief by exercising unprecedented authority . he expanded his war powers , imposed a blockade on confederate ports , disbursed funds before appropriation by congress , suspended habeas corpus , and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers . lincoln gained the support of congress and the northern public for these actions . lincoln also had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success , and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle , such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions . copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery . the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery . on august 6 , 1861 , lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates . the law had little practical effect , but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in august 1861 , general john frémont , the 1856 republican presidential nominee , without consulting washington , issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels . lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity . as a result , union enlistments from maryland , kentucky , and missouri increased by over 40000 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break internationally , lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the confederacy . he relied on his combative secretary of state william seward while working closely with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner . in the 1861 trent affair which threatened war with great britain , the navy illegally intercepted a british mail ship , the trent , on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys ; britain protested vehemently while the cheered . lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats . biographer james randall dissected lincolns successful techniques : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the war department . he tracked all phases of the effort , consulting with governors , and selecting generals based on their success , their state , and their party . in january 1862 , after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department , lincoln replaced war secretary simon cameron with edwin stanton . stanton centralized the war departments activities , auditing and canceling contracts , saving the federal government 17000000 . stanton was a staunch unionist , pro - business , conservative democrat who gravitated toward the radical republican faction . he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official . " stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together " , say thomas and hyman . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincolns war strategy embraced two priorities : ensuring that washington was well - defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt , decisive victory . twice a week , lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon . occasionally mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride , concerned that he was working too hard . for his edification lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff general henry halleck entitled elements of military art and science ; halleck was a disciple of the european strategist antoine - henri jomini . lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points , such as the mississippi river . lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army , rather than simply capturing territory . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in directing the unions war strategy , lincoln valued the advice of gen . winfield scott , even after his retirement as commanding general of the united states army . on june 23–24 , 1862 , president lincoln made an unannounced visit to west point , where he spent five hours consulting with scott regarding the handling of the civil war and the staffing of the war department . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the union rout at bull run and winfield scotts retirement , lincoln appointed major general george mcclellan general - in - chief . mcclellan then took months to plan his virginia peninsula campaign . mcclellans slow progress frustrated lincoln , as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington . mcclellan , in turn , blamed the failure of the campaign on lincolns reservation of troops for the capitol . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1862 , lincoln removed mcclellan for the generals continued inaction . he elevated henry halleck in july and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia . pope satisfied lincolns desire to advance on richmond from the north , thus protecting washington from counterattack . but pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 , forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellans failure to reinforce pope , lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington . two days after mcclellans return to command , general robert lees forces crossed the potomac river into maryland , leading to the battle of antietam . that battle , a union victory , was among the bloodiest in american history ; it facilitated lincolns emancipation proclamation in january . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mcclellan then resisted the presidents demand that he pursue lees withdrawing army , while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee . lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans ; and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside . the appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on lincolns part . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break burnside , against presidential advice , launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december . desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after fredericksburg , so lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 1862 midterm elections the republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation , high taxes , rumors of corruption , suspension of habeas corpus , military draft law , and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market . the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest , but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest , where many southerners had lived for generations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the spring of 1863 lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near ; the plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond , rosecrans on chattanooga , grant on vicksburg , and a naval assault on charleston . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may , then resigned and was replaced by george meade . meade followed lee north into pennsylvania and beat him in the gettysburg campaign , but then failed to follow up despite lincolns demands . at the same time , grant captured vicksburg and gained control of the mississippi river , splitting the far western rebel states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break image : emancipation proclamation . pgthumbupright1first reading of the emancipation proclamation of president lincoln by francis bicknell carpenter ( 1864 ) ( clickable image—use cursor to identify . alta dark - haired , bearded , middle - aged man holding documents is seated among seven other men . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 269 892 254 775 193 738 130 723 44 613 19 480 49 453 75 434 58 376 113 344 133 362 143 423 212 531 307 657 357 675 409 876 edwin stanton uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 169 282 172 244 244 201 244 148 265 117 292 125 305 166 304 204 321 235 355 296 374 348 338 395 341 469 salmon chase uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 569 893 535 708 427 613 357 562 377 456 393 404 468 351 451 317 473 259 520 256 544 283 530 339 526 374 559 401 594 431 639 494 715 542 692 551 693 579 672 546 623 552 596 617 698 629 680 852 abraham lincoln uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 692 514 740 441 788 407 772 350 800 303 831 297 861 329 867 381 868 409 913 430 913 471 847 532 816 533 709 533 gideon welles uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 703 783 752 769 825 627 907 620 929 569 905 538 886 563 833 563 873 502 930 450 1043 407 1043 389 1036 382 1042 363 1058 335 1052 333 1052 324 1081 318 1124 338 1133 374 1116 412 1132 466 1145 509 1117 588 1087 632 1083 706 william seward uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 905 418 941 328 987 295 995 284 982 244 990 206 1036 207 1046 247 1047 284 1066 312 1071 314 1049 327 1044 354 1033 383 1033 407 921 453 caleb smith uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 1081 308 1102 255 1095 220 1093 181 1109 161 1145 160 1169 191 1153 227 1153 246 1199 268 1230 310 1239 377 1237 443 1220 486 1125 451 1118 412 1136 378 1124 342 montgomery blair uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 1224 479 1298 416 1304 379 1295 329 1325 310 1360 324 1370 359 1371 385 1371 397 1413 425 1422 497 1440 563 1348 555 1232 517 edward bates uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 625 555 595 620 699 625 730 550 emancipation proclamation uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 120 80 120 300 3 300 3 80 portrait of simon cameron uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 752 196 961 189 948 8 735 10 portrait of andrew jackson uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the federal governments power to end slavery was limited by the constitution , which before 1865 delegated the issue to the individual states . lincoln argued that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented . he sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves in return for their acceptance of abolition . lincoln rejected fremonts two emancipation attempts in august 1861 , as well as one by major general david hunter in may 1862 , on the grounds that it was not within their power , and would upset loyal border states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in june 1862 , congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory , which lincoln signed . in july , the confiscation act of 1862 was enacted , providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion ; lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional . he felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander - in - chief , which he planned to exercise . lincoln at this time reviewed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break privately , lincoln concluded that the confederacys slave base had to be eliminated . copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification ; republican editor horace greeley of the new york tribune agreed . in a letter of august 22 , 1862 , lincoln said that while he personally wished all men could be free , regardless of that , his first obligation as president was to preserve the union : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on september 22 , 1862 , lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation , which announced that , in states still in rebellion on january 1 , 1863 , the slaves would be freed . he kept his word and , on january 1 , 1863 , issued the emancipation proclamation , freeing the slaves in 10 states not then under union control , with exemptions specified for areas under such control . lincolns comment on signing the proclamation was : " i never , in my life , felt more certain that i was doing right , than i do in signing this paper . " he spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation , while democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective , union armies advancing south liberated three million slaves . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break enlisting former slaves became official policy . by the spring of 1863 , lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers . in a letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops , lincoln wrote , " the bare sight of 50000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once " . by the end of 1863 , at lincolns direction , general lorenzo thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln spoke at the dedication of the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november 19 , 1863 . in 272 words , and three minutes , lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789 , but in 1776 , " conceived in liberty , and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal " . he defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all . he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain , that slavery would end , and the future of democracy would be assured , that " government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break defying his prediction that " the world will little note , nor long remember what we say here " , the address became the most quoted speech in american history . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break image : the peacemakers 1868 . pgthumbupright1the peacemakers , an 1868 painting by george healy of events aboard the river queen in march 1865 ( clickable image—use cursor to identify . altpainting of four men conferring in a ships cabin , entitled " the peacemakers " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 486 710 579 672 663 739 687 863 649 936 579 965 739 1133 782 1037 800 956 910 905 905 1025 855 1305 576 1223 513 1371 620 1388 687 1467 846 1510 1010 2035 1160 2140 869 2135 718 1682 663 1685 634 2000 725 2030 489 2095 504 1800 362 1775 263 1710 225 1516 252 1226 269 1046 324 948 434 913 481 866 446 782 general sherman uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 1092 794 1182 823 1188 892 1162 970 1220 1023 1330 1179 1429 1153 1478 1223 1388 1498 1440 1548 1397 1568 1397 1788 1429 1826 1385 1867 1301 1838 1275 1571 1243 1533 1243 1478 1095 1492 985 1588 924 1133 970 1028 1046 991 1028 907 1034 837 general grant uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 1634 802 1715 770 1794 825 1800 950 1933 962 2194 1072 2188 1185 2116 1347 2029 1396 2032 1547 1669 1544 1740 1947 1527 1945 1579 1875 1620 1852 1599 1730 1565 1883 1394 1930 1408 1872 1454 1817 1559 1333 1568 1260 1599 1182 1672 980 1620 886 president lincoln uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poly 2620 780 2740 775 2754 889 2745 991 2855 1064 2864 1316 2800 1420 2766 1516 2806 1600 2772 1942 2664 1919 2577 1791 2508 1780 2496 1719 2455 1745 2496 2052 2348 2145 2308 2128 2345 2038 2293 1759 2229 2081 1977 2076 1997 2035 2058 2009 2093 1965 2174 1537 2461 1429 2453 1290 2357 1382 2287 1336 2290 1287 2354 1203 2412 1179 2499 1133 2540 1072 2560 988 2595 837 admiral porter uvmr_ev_paragraph_break general ulysses grants victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln . responding to criticism of grant after shiloh , lincoln had said , " i cant spare this man . with grant in command , lincoln felt the union army could advance in multiple theaters , while also including black troops . meades failure to capture lees army after gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to promote grant to supreme commander . grant then assumed command of meades army . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864 . he arranged for an intermediary to inquire into grants political intentions , and once assured that he had none , lincoln promoted grant to the newly revived rank of lieutenant general , a rank which had been unoccupied since george washington . authorization for such a promotion " with the advice and consent of the senate " was provided by a new bill which lincoln signed the same day he submitted grants name to the senate . his nomination was confirmed by the senate on march 2 , 1864 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break grant in 1864 waged the bloody overland campaign , which exacted heavy losses on both sides . when lincoln asked what grants plans were , the persistent general replied , " i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer . " grants army moved steadily south . lincoln traveled to grants headquarters at city point , virginia , to confer with grant and william tecumseh sherman . lincoln reacted to union losses by mobilizing support throughout the north . lincoln authorized grant to target infrastructure—plantations , railroads , and bridges—hoping to weaken the souths morale and fighting ability . he emphasized defeat of the confederate armies over destruction ( which was considerable ) for its own sake . lincolns engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when confederate general jubal early raided washington , legend has it that while lincoln watched from an exposed position , union captain ( and future supreme court justice ) oliver wendell holmes jr . shouted at him , " get down , you damn fool , before you get shot ! " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as grant continued to weaken lees forces , efforts to discuss peace began . confederate vice president stephens led a group meeting with lincoln , seward , and others at hampton roads . lincoln refused to negotiate with the confederacy as a coequal ; his objective to end the fighting was not realized . on april 1 , 1865 , grant nearly encircled petersburg in a siege . the confederate government evacuated richmond and lincoln visited the conquered capital . on april 9 , lee surrendered to grant at appomattox , officially ending the war . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln ran for reelection in 1864 , while uniting the main republican factions , along with war democrats edwin stanton and andrew johnson . lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the radicals ' efforts to replace him . at its convention , the republicans selected johnson as his running mate . to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans , lincoln ran under the label of the new union party . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break grants bloody stalemates damaged lincolns re - election prospects , and many republicans feared defeat . lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election , he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house ; lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet , but asked them to sign the sealed envelope . the pledge read as follows : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the democratic platform followed the " peace wing " of the party and called the war a " failure " ; but their candidate , mcclellan , supported the war and repudiated the platform . meanwhile , lincoln emboldened grant with more troops and republican party support . shermans capture of atlanta in september and david farraguts capture of mobile ended defeatism . the democratic party was deeply split , with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln . the national union party was united by lincolns support for emancipation . state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads . on november 8 , lincoln carried all but three states , including 78 percent of union soldiers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on march 4 , 1865 , lincoln delivered his second inaugural address . in it , he deemed the war casualties to be gods will . historian mark noll places the speech " among the small handful of semi - sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world ; " it is inscribed in the lincoln memorial . lincoln said : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reconstruction preceded the wars end , as lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation , and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves . when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates were to be treated , lincoln replied , " let ' em up easy . " lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath , and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states . his main goal was to keep the union together , so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame , but on how to rebuild the nation as one . lincoln led the moderates in reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radicals , under rep . thaddeus stevens , sen . charles sumner and sen . benjamin wade , who otherwise remained lincolns allies . determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the south , lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held . his amnesty proclamation of december 8 , 1863 , offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office and had not mistreated union prisoners , if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as southern states fell , they needed leaders while their administrations were restored . in tennessee and arkansas , lincoln respectively appointed johnson and frederick steele as military governors . in louisiana , lincoln ordered general nathaniel banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed , and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery . democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the republicans ' political aspirations . the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient , and passed their own plan , the 1864 wade–davis bill , which lincoln vetoed . the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana , arkansas , and tennessee . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincolns appointments were designed to harness both moderates and radicals . to fill chief justice taneys seat on the supreme court , he named the radicals ' choice , salmon chase , who lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after implementing the emancipation proclamation , lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment . he declared that such an amendment would " clinch the whole matter " and by december 1863 an amendment was brought to congress . this first attempt fell short of the required two - thirds majority in the house of representatives . passage became part of lincolns reelection platform , and after his successful reelection , the second attempt in the house passed on january 31 , 1865 . with ratification , it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6 , 1865 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen . he signed senator charles sumners freedmens bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves . the law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen . lincoln announced a reconstruction plan that involved short - term military control , pending readmission under the control of southern unionists . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly how reconstruction would have proceeded had lincoln lived . biographers james randall and richard current , according to david lincove , argue that : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break eric foner argues that : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincolns experience with indians followed the death of his grandfather abraham by indian assailants , in the presence of his father and uncles . lincoln was a veteran of the black hawk war , which was fought in wisconsin and illinois in 1832 . he volunteered with the goal of expelling indians from illinois , but he saw no combat . during his presidency , lincolns policy toward indians was driven by politics . he used the indian bureau as a source of patronage , making appointments to his loyal followers in minnesota and wisconsin . he faced difficulties guarding western settlers , railroads , and telegraphs , from indian attacks . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on august 17 , 1862 , the dakota uprising in minnesota , supported by the yankton indians , killed hundreds of white settlers , forced 30000 from their homes , and deeply alarmed washington . some feared incorrectly that it might represent a conspiracy by the confederacy to launch a war on the northwestern front . lincoln sent general john pope to minnesota as commander of the new department of the northwest . lincoln ordered thousands of confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the dakota uprising . when the confederates protested forcing confederate prisoners to fight indians , lincoln revoked the policy . pope fought hard against the indians . he ordered indian farms and food supplies be destroyed , and indian warriors be killed . aiding pope , minnesota congressman col . henry sibley led militiamen and regular troops to defeat the dakota at wood lake . by october 9 , pope considered the uprising to be ended ; hostilities ceased on december 26 . an unusual military court was set up to prosecute captured natives , with lincoln effectively acting as the route of appeal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln personally reviewed each of 303 execution warrants for santee dakota convicted of killing innocent farmers ; he commuted the sentences of all but 39 ( one was later reprieved ) . lincoln sought to be lenient , but still send a message . he also faced significant public pressure , including threats of mob justice should any of the dakota be spared . former governor of minnesota alexander ramsey told lincoln , in 1864 , that he would have gotten more presidential election support had he executed all 303 of the indians . lincoln responded , " i could not afford to hang men for votes . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln adhered to the whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to congress ' responsibility for legislating . lincoln vetoed only four bills , including the wade - davis bill with its harsh reconstruction program . the 1862 homestead act made millions of acres of western government - held land available for purchase at low cost . the 1862 morrill land - grant colleges act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state . the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states ' first transcontinental railroad , which was completed in 1869 . the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was enabled by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the selection and use of his cabinet , lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency . lincoln commented on his thought process , " we need the strongest men of the party in the cabinet . we needed to hold our own people together . i had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men . then i had no right to deprive the country of their services . " goodwin described the group in her biography as a team of rivals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there were two measures passed to raise revenues for the federal government : tariffs ( a policy with long precedent ) , and a federal income tax . in 1861 , lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariffs , following the first enacted by buchanan . he also signed the revenue act of 1861 , creating the first income tax—a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above 800 ( in current dollar terms ) . the revenue act of 1862 adopted rates that increased with income . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the lincoln administration presided over the expansion of the federal governments economic influence in other areas . the national banking act created the system of national banks . the us issued paper currency for the first time , known as greenbacks—printed in green on the reverse side . in 1862 , congress created the department of agriculture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in response to rumors of a renewed draft , the editors of the new york world and the journal of commerce published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market . lincoln attacked the media for such behavior , and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln is largely responsible for the thanksgiving holiday . thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in new england in the 17th century . it had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates . the prior proclamation had been during james madisons presidency 50 years earlier . in 1863 , lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in june 1864 , lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress , which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincolns philosophy on court nominations was that " we cannot ask a man what he will do , and if we should , and he should answer us , we should despise him for it . therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known . " lincoln made five appointments to the supreme court . noah haynes swayne was an anti - slavery lawyer who was committed to the union . samuel freeman miller supported lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist . david davis was lincolns campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the illinois court circuit where lincoln practiced . democrat stephen johnson field , a previous california supreme court justice , provided geographic and political balance . finally , lincolns treasury secretary , salmon chase , became chief justice . lincoln believed chase was an able jurist , would support reconstruction legislation , and that his appointment united the republican party . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln named his main political rival william seward as secretary of state , and left most diplomatic issues in his portfolio . however lincoln did select some of the top diplomats as part of his patronage policy . he also closely watched the handling of the trent affair in late 1861 to make sure there was no escalation into a war with britain . sewards main role was to keep britain and france from supporting the confederacy . he was successful after indicating to london and paris that washington would declare war on them if they supported richmond . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break john wilkes booth was a well - known actor and a confederate spy from maryland ; though he never joined the confederate army , he had contacts with the confederate secret service . after attending an april 11 , 1865 speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks , booth hatched a plot to assassinate the president . when booth learned of the lincolns ' intent to attend a play with general grant , he planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at fords theatre . lincoln and his wife attended the play our american cousin on the evening of april 14 , just five days after the union victory at the battle of appomattox courthouse . at the last minute , grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on april 14 , 1865 , hours before he was assassinated , lincoln signed legislation establishing the united states secret service , and , at 10 : 15 in the evening , booth entered the back of lincolns theater box , crept up from behind , and fired at the back of lincolns head , mortally wounding him . lincolns guest , major henry rathbone , momentarily grappled with booth , but booth stabbed him and escaped . after being attended by doctor charles leale and two other doctors , lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house . after remaining in a coma for eight hours , lincoln died at 7 : 22 in the morning on april 15 . stanton saluted and said , " now he belongs to the ages . " lincolns body was placed in a flag - wrapped coffin , which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the white house by union soldiers . president johnson was sworn in later that same day . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break two weeks later , booth , refusing to surrender , was tracked to a farm in virginia , and was mortally shot by sergeant boston corbett and died on april 26 . secretary of war stanton had issued orders that booth be taken alive , so corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed . after a brief interview , stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the late president lay in state , first in the east room of the white house , and then in the capitol rotunda from april 19 through april 21 . the caskets containing lincolns body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the lincoln special funeral train . the train followed a circuitous route from washington to springfield , illinois , stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands . many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands , bonfires , and hymn singing or in silent grief . poet walt whitman composed " when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd " to eulogize him , one of four poems he wrote about lincoln . african americans were especially moved ; they had lost ' their moses ' . in a larger sense , the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war . historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow , but noted that some lincoln haters celebrated his death . lincolns body was buried at oak ridge cemetery in springfield and now lies within the lincoln tomb . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a young man , lincoln was a religious skeptic . he was deeply familiar with the bible , quoting and praising it . he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others . he never made a clear profession of christian beliefs . through his entire public career , lincoln had a proneness for quoting scripture . his three most famous speeches—the house divided speech , the gettysburg address , and his second inaugural—each contain direct allusions to providence and quotes from scripture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 1840s , lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity , a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power . with the death of his son edward in 1850 he more frequently expressed a dependence on god . he never joined a church , although he frequently attended first presbyterian church with his wife beginning in 1852 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 1850s , lincoln asserted his belief in " providence " in a general way , and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals ; he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence . the death of son willie in february 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace . after willies death , he questioned the divine necessity of the wars severity . he wrote at this time that god " could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest . yet the contest began . and having begun , he could give the final victory to either side any day . yet the contest proceeds . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln did believe in an all - powerful god that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches . by the end of the war , he increasingly appealed to the almighty for solace and to explain events , writing on april 4 , 1864 , to a newspaper editor in kentucky : this spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address , considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in american history , and by lincoln himself as his own greatest speech , or one of them at the very least . lincoln explains therein that the cause , purpose , and result of the war was gods will . lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences , who were mostly evangelical protestants . on the day lincoln was assassinated , he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincoln is believed to have had depression , smallpox , and malaria . he took blue mass pills , which contained mercury , to treat constipation . it is unknown to what extent that might have resulted in mercury poisoning . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several claims have been made that lincolns health was declining before the assassination . these are often based on photographs of lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincolns redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as john patrick diggins , harry jaffa , vernon burton , eric foner , and herman belz . lincoln called the declaration of independence—which emphasized freedom and equality for all—the " sheet anchor " of republicanism beginning in the 1850s . he did this at a time when the constitution , which " tolerated slavery " , was the focus of most political discourse . diggins notes , " lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself " in the 1860 cooper union speech . instead of focusing on the legality of an argument , he focused on the moral basis of republicanism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break his position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially a contract among the states , and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract . furthermore , it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state . many soldiers and religious leaders from the north , though , felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a whig activist , lincoln was a spokesman for business interests , favoring high tariffs , banks , infrastructure improvements , and railroads , in opposition to jacksonian democrats . lincoln shared the sympathies that the jacksonians professed for the common man , but he disagreed with the jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise . nevertheless , lincoln admired andrew jacksons steeliness as well as his patriotism . according to historian sean wilentz : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break william harris found that lincolns " reverence for the founding fathers , the constitution , the laws under it , and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism . " james randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation " in his preference for orderly progress , his distrust of dangerous agitation , and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform . " randall concludes that " he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so - called ' radicalism ' which involved abuse of the south , hatred for the slaveholder , thirst for vengeance , partisan plotting , and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in lincolns first inaugural address , he explored the nature of democracy . he denounced secession as anarchy , and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints . he said " a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations , and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments , is the only true sovereign of a free people . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country . the term " the united states " has historically been used sometimes in the plural ( " these united states " ) and other times in the singular . the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in surveys of scholars ranking presidents conducted since 1948 , the top three presidents are lincoln , washington , and franklin delano roosevelt , although the order varies . between 1999 and 2011 , lincoln , john kennedy , and ronald reagan have been the top - ranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys , according to gallup . a 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one , while legal scholars placed him second after george washington . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincolns assassination left him a national martyr . he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty . republicans linked lincolns name to their party . many , though not all , in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability . historians have said he was " a classical liberal " in the 19th - century sense . allen guelzo states that lincoln was a " classical liberal democrat—an enemy of artificial hierarchy , a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling , and an american counterpart to mill , cobden , and bright " , whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schwartz argues that lincolns american reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the progressive era ( 1900–1920s ) , when he emerged as one of americas most venerated heroes , even among white southerners . the high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break union nationalism , as envisioned by lincoln , " helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt , woodrow wilson , and franklin delano roosevelt . " in the new deal era , liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self - made man or the great war president , but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sociologist barry schwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with " a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life . " during the great depression , he argues , lincoln served " as a means for seeing the worlds disappointments , for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful " . franklin roosevelt , preparing america for war , used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan . americans asked , " what would lincoln do ? " however , schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincolns symbolic power has lost relevance , and this " fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness . " he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the cold war years , lincolns image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes . by the late 1960s , some african american intellectuals , led by lerone bennett jr . rejected lincolns role as the great emancipator . bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968 . he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks . bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country . the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery , or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them . defenders of lincoln , such as authors dirck and cashin , retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a " moral visionary " who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause , as fast as politically possible . dirck stated that few civil war scholars take bennett seriously , pointing to his " narrow political agenda and faulty research " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by the 1970s , lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives—apart from neo - confederates such as mel bradford , who denounced his treatment of the white south—for his intense nationalism , his support for business , his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery , his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition , and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers . lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break historian barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincolns image suffered " erosion , fading prestige , benign ridicule " in the late 20th century . on the other hand , donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability , defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were " content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts , and not compelled toward fact or reason " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 21st century , president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the lincoln bible for his inaugural ceremonies . lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood , almost always in a flattering light . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lincolns portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency , the penny and the 5 bill . his likeness also appears on many postage stamps . while he is usually portrayed bearded , he did not grow a beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11 - year - old grace bedell . he was the first of five presidents to do so . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he has been memorialized in many town , city , and county names , including the capital of nebraska . the united states navy is named after lincoln , the second navy ship to bear his name . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the lincoln memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nations capital , and is one of the top five visited national park service sites in the country . fords theatre , among the top sites in washington , , memorials in springfield , illinois include abraham lincoln presidential library and museum , lincolns home , as well as his tomb . a portrait carving of lincoln appears with those of three other presidents on mount rushmore , which receives about 3million visitors a year . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break - uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 8: Aristotle ***********

virtually all subsequent western and middle eastern philosophy , especially aristotelianism including averroism , avicennism , literary neo - aristotelianism , maimonideanism , objectivism , peripatetics , scholasticism ( llullism , neo , scotism , second , thomism , etc ) , school of brentano , additionally middle platonism and neoplatonism as well as significant amounts of subsequent science especially protoscience . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break see : list of writers influenced by aristotle , commentaries on aristotle , pseudo - aristotle uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle ( ; aristotélēs , ; 384–322bc ) was a greek philosopher and polymath during the classical period in ancient greece . taught by plato , he was the founder of the lyceum , the peripatetic school of philosophy , and the aristotelian tradition . his writings cover many subjects including physics , biology , zoology , metaphysics , logic , ethics , aesthetics , poetry , theatre , music , rhetoric , psychology , linguistics , economics , politics , meteorology , geology , and government . aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him . it was above all from his teachings that the west inherited its intellectual lexicon , as well as problems and methods of inquiry . as a result , his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the west and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break little is known about his life . aristotle was born in the city of stagira in northern greece . his father , nicomachus , died when aristotle was a child , and he was brought up by a guardian . at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined platos academy in athens and remained there until the age of thirty - seven . shortly after plato died , aristotle left athens and , at the request of philip ii of macedon , tutored alexander the great beginning in 343 bc . he established a library in the lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls . though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication , only around a third of his original output has survived , none of it intended for publication . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship . the influence of physical science extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance , and were not replaced systematically until the enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed . some of aristotles zoological observations found in his biology , such as on the hectocotyl ( reproductive ) arm of the octopus , were disbelieved until the 19th century . he also influenced judeo - islamic philosophies ( 800–1400 ) during the middle ages , as well as christian theology , especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholastic tradition of the catholic church . aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as " the first teacher " , and among medieval christians like thomas aquinas as simply " the philosopher " , while the poet dante called him " the master of those who know " . his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic , and were studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles influence on logic continued well into the 19th century . in addition , his ethics , though always influential , gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics . aristotle has been called " the father of logic " , " the father of biology " , " the father of political science " , " the father of zoology " , " the father of embryology " , " the father of natural law " , " the father of scientific method " , " the father of rhetoric " , " the father of psychology " , " the father of realism " , " the father of criticism " , " the father of individualism " , " the father of teleology " , and " the father of meteorology " . efnnamelitlist1 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in general , the details of aristotles life are not well - established . the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points .  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle , whose name means " the best purpose " in ancient greek , was born in 384bc in stagira , chalcidice , about 55km ( 34 miles ) east of modern - day thessaloniki . his father , nicomachus , was the personal physician to king amyntas of macedon . while he was young , aristotle learned about biology and medical information , which was taught by his father . both of aristotles parents died when he was about thirteen , and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian . although little information about aristotles childhood has survived , he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace , making his first connections with the macedonian monarchy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the age of seventeen or eighteen , aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at platos academy . he probably experienced the eleusinian mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the eleusinian mysteries , " to experience is to learn " ' μαθεĩν ' . aristotle remained in athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in 348 / 47bc . the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academys direction after control passed to platos nephew speusippus , although it is possible that he feared the anti - macedonian sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died . aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor . after the death of hermias , aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos , where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon . while in lesbos , aristotle married pythias , either hermiass adoptive daughter or niece . she bore him a daughter , whom they also named pythias . in 343 bc , aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon . during aristotles time in the macedonian court , he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings : ptolemy and cassander . aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest , and aristotles own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentric . in one famous example , he counsels alexander to be " a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians , to look after the former as after friends and relatives , and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants " . by 335bc , aristotle had returned to athens , establishing his own school there known as the lyceum . aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years . while in athens , his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira , who bore him a son whom he named after his father , nicomachus . if the suda an uncritical compilation from the middle ages is accurate , he may also have had an erômenos , palaephatus of abydus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this period in athens , between 335 and 323 bc , is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works . he wrote many dialogues , of which only fragments have survived . those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not , for the most part , intended for widespread publication ; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students . his most important treatises include physics , metaphysics , nicomachean ethics , politics , on the soul and poetics . aristotle studied and made significant contributions to " logic , metaphysics , mathematics , physics , biology , botany , ethics , politics , agriculture , medicine , dance , and theatre . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break near the end of his life , alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexanders relationship with persia and persians . a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexanders death , but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death . following alexanders death , anti - macedonian sentiment in athens was rekindled . in 322bc , demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety , prompting him to flee to his mothers family estate in chalcis , on euboea , at which occasion he was said to have stated : " i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy " – a reference to athenss trial and execution of socrates . he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year , having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the prior analytics , aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic , and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until 19th - century advances in mathematical logic . kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break what is today called aristotelian logic with its types of syllogism ( methods of logical argument ) , aristotle himself would have labelled " analytics " . the term " logic " he reserved to mean dialectics . most of aristotles work is probably not in its original form , because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers . the logical works of aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the organon around 40 bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers . the books are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the order of the books ( or the teachings from which they are composed ) is not certain , but this list was derived from analysis of aristotles writings . it goes from the basics , the analysis of simple terms in the categories , the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation , to the study of more complex forms , namely , syllogisms ( in the analytics ) and dialectics ( in the topics and sophistical refutations ) . the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu : the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning . the rhetoric is not conventionally included , but it states that it relies on the topics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word " metaphysics " appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotles works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics . aristotle called it " first philosophy " , and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science ( physics ) as the contemplative ( theoretikē ) philosophy which is " theological " and studies the divine . he wrote in his metaphysics ( 1026a16 ) : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle examines the concepts of substance ( ousia ) and essence ( to ti ên einai , " the what it was to be " ) in his metaphysics ( book vii ) , and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form , a philosophical theory called hylomorphism . in book viii , he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum , or the stuff of which it is composed . for example , the matter of a house is the bricks , stones , timbers , etcetera , or whatever constitutes the potential house , while the form of the substance is the actual house , namely ' covering for bodies and chattels ' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house . the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter , and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break like his teacher plato , aristotles philosophy aims at the universal . aristotles ontology places the universal ( katholou ) in particulars ( kath ' hekaston ) , things in the world , whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate . for aristotle , " form " is still what phenomena are based on , but is " instantiated " in a particular substance . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break plato argued that all things have a universal form , which could be either a property or a relation to other things . when one looks at an apple , for example , one sees an apple , and one can also analyse a form of an apple . in this distinction , there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple . moreover , one can place an apple next to a book , so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other . plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things . for example , it is possible that there is no particular good in existence , but " good " is still a proper universal form . aristotle disagreed with plato on this point , arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time , and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things . in addition , aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals . where plato spoke of the world of forms , a place where all universal forms subsist , aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated . so , according to aristotle , the form of apple exists within each apple , rather than in the world of the forms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with regard to the change ( kinesis ) and its causes now , as he defines in his physics and on generation and corruption 319b–320a , he distinguishes the coming to be from : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property . in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality ( dynamis ) and actuality ( entelecheia ) in association with the matter and the form . referring to potentiality , this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else . for example , the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially ( dynamei ) a plant , and if it is not prevented by something , it will become a plant . potentially beings can either ' act ' ( poiein ) or ' be acted upon ' ( paschein ) , which can be either innate or learned . for example , the eyes possess the potentiality of sight ( innate – being acted upon ) , while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning ( exercise – acting ) . actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality . because the end ( telos ) is the principle of every change , and for the sake of the end exists potentiality , therefore actuality is the end . referring then to the previous example , it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in summary , the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities , which is also a final cause or end . then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula , in time and in substantiality . with this definition of the particular substance ( that is , matter and form ) , aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings , for example , " what is it that makes a man one " ? since , according to plato there are two ideas : animal and biped , how then is man a unity ? however , according to aristotle , the potential being ( matter ) and the actual one ( form ) are one and the same . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world , and rises to knowledge of the universal , whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal forms ( or ideas ) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these . aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction , whereas plato relies on deduction from a priori principles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles " natural philosophy " spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics , biology and other natural sciences . in aristotles terminology , " natural philosophy " is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world , and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics , biology and other natural sciences . aristotles work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry . aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning , which he also would describe as " science " . however , his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term " scientific method " . for aristotle , " all science ( dianoia ) is either practical , poetical or theoretical " ( metaphysics 1025b25 ) . his practical science includes ethics and politics ; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry ; his theoretical science covers physics , mathematics and metaphysics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his on generation and corruption , aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles , earth , water , air , and fire , to two of the four sensible qualities , hot , cold , wet , and dry . in the empedoclean scheme , all matter was made of the four elements , in differing proportions . aristotles scheme added the heavenly aether , the divine substance of the heavenly spheres , stars and planets . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle describes two kinds of motion : " violent " or " unnatural motion " , such as that of a thrown stone , in the physics ( 254b10 ) , and " natural motion " , such as of a falling object , in on the heavens ( 300a20 ) . in violent motion , as soon as the agent stops causing it , the motion stops also : in other words , the natural state of an object is to be at rest , since aristotle does not address friction . with this understanding , it can be observed that , as aristotle stated , heavy objects ( on the ground , say ) require more force to make them move ; and objects pushed with greater force move faster . this would imply the equation uvmr_ev_paragraph_break incorrect in modern physics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break natural motion depends on the element concerned : the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens , while the 4 empedoclean elements move vertically up ( like fire , as is observed ) or down ( like earth ) towards their natural resting places . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the physics ( 215a25 ) , aristotle effectively states a quantitative law , that the speed , v , of a falling body is proportional ( say , with constant c ) to its weight , w , and inversely proportional to the density , ρ , of the fluid in which it is falling : ; uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite , and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible . opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws . henri carteron held the " extreme view " that aristotles concept of force was basically qualitative , but other authors reject this . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break archimedes corrected aristotles theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places ; metal boats can float if they displace enough water ; floating depends in archimedes ' scheme on the mass and volume of the object , not , as aristotle thought , its elementary composition . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period . john philoponus ( in the middle ages ) and galileo are said to have shown by experiment that aristotles claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect . a contrary opinion is given by carlo rovelli , who argues that aristotles physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity , that of objects in the earths gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air . in this system , heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones ( whether friction is ignored , or not ) , and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break newtons " forced " motion corresponds to aristotles " violent " motion with its external agent , but aristotles assumption that the agents effect stops immediately it stops acting ( for example , the ball leaves the throwers hand ) has awkward consequences : he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it , resulting in the medieval theory of impetus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors . his term aitia is traditionally translated as " cause " , but it does not always refer to temporal sequence ; it might be better translated as " explanation " , but the traditional rendering will be employed here . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in problems , book 15 . the apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in . with it , he saw that whatever shape he made the hole , the suns image always remained circular . he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to aristotle , spontaneity and chance are causes of some things , distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity . chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things , " from what is spontaneous " . there is also more a specific kind of chance , which aristotle names " luck " , that only applies to peoples moral choices . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in astronomy , aristotle refuted democrituss claim that the milky way was made up of " those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays , " pointing out correctly that if " the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun , then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations . he stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one persons lifetime . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change , including " lakes that had dried up " and " deserts that had become watered by rivers " , giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer , and " the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands , previous to a volcanic eruption . " ' uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle and meteorology ( including his major writings " meteorologica " ) . for example , he made some of the earliest observations about desalination : he observed early – and correctly – that when seawater is heated , freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff ( " i have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water again . " ) uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically , and biology forms a large part of his writings . he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas , including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos . his data in history of animals , generation of animals , movement of animals , and parts of animals are assembled from his own observations , cite weburlhttps : / / www . ndependent . o . k / arts - entertainment / books / reviews / darwins - ghosts - by - rebecca - stott - 7808310 . tmltitledarwins ghosts , by rebecca stott uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle reports on the sea - life visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen . he describes the catfish , electric ray , and frogfish in detail , as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus . his description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods , used in sexual reproduction , was widely disbelieved until the 19th century . he gives accurate descriptions of the four - chambered fore - stomachs of ruminants , and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he notes that an animals structure is well matched to function , so , among birds , the heron , which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish , has a long neck and long legs , and a sharp spear - like beak , whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet . darwin , too , noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal , but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution . aristotles writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution , but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridizations could occur , he saw these as rare accidents . for aristotle , accidents , like heat waves in winter , must be considered distinct from natural causes . he was thus critical of empedocless materialist theory of a " survival of the fittest " origin of living things and their organs , and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results . to put his views into modern terms , he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor , or that one kind can change into another , or that kinds can become extinct . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense . he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations , or at most investigative procedures like dissection . in generation of animals , he finds a fertilized hens egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryos heart beating inside . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break instead , he practiced a different style of science : systematically gathering data , discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals , and inferring possible causal explanations from these . this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field , such as genomics . it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science , but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed . in this sense , aristotles biology is scientific . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from the data he collected and documented , aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life - history features of the live - bearing tetrapods ( terrestrial placental mammals ) that he studied . among these correct predictions are the following . brood size decreases with ( adult ) body mass , so that an elephant has fewer young ( usually just one ) per brood than a mouse . lifespan increases with gestation period , and also with body mass , so that elephants live longer than mice , have a longer period of gestation , and are heavier . as a final example , fecundity decreases with lifespan , so long - lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short - lived kinds like mice . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals , arranging these in the history of animals in a graded scale of perfection , a nonreligious version of the scala naturae , with man at the top . his system had eleven grades of animal , from highest potential to lowest , expressed in their form at birth : the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures , the lowest laid cold , dry mineral - like eggs . animals came above plants , and these in turn were above minerals . see also : he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter " animals with blood " , and below them the colder invertebrates as " animals without blood " . those with blood were divided into the live - bearing ( mammals ) , and the egg - laying ( birds , reptiles , fish ) . those without blood were insects , crustacea ( non - shelled – cephalopods , and shelled ) and the hard - shelled molluscs ( bivalves and gastropods ) . he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale , and noted various exceptions , such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods . to a modern biologist , the explanation , not available to aristotle , is convergent evolution . philosophers of science have generally concluded that aristotle was not interested in taxonomy , but zoologists who studied this question recently think otherwise . he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes ; this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles psychology , given in his treatise on the soul ( peri psychēs ) , posits three kinds of soul ( " psyches " ) : the vegetative soul , the sensitive soul , and the rational soul . humans have a rational soul . the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds : like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself ; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally . the unique part of the human , rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the nous ( intellect ) and logos ( reason ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for aristotle , the soul is the form of a living being . because all beings are composites of form and matter , the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings , for example the ability to initiate movement ( or in the case of plants , growth and chemical transformations , which aristotle considers types of movement ) . in contrast to earlier philosophers , but in accordance with the egyptians , he placed the rational soul in the heart , rather than the brain . notable is aristotles division of sensation and thought , which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers , with the exception of alcmaeon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to aristotle in on the soul , memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal " appearance " and an occurrence in the past . in other words , a memory is a mental picture ( phantasm ) that can be recovered . aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi - fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory . a memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once . these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation , aristotelian , and thinking . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle uses the term ' memory ' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation , and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents . memory is of the past , prediction is of the future , and sensation is of the present . retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly . a transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences , both for previous experience and present experience . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions , people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences . to search for these impressions , people search the memory itself . within the memory , if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory , that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for . recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another . if the chain of " images " is needed , one memory will stimulate the next . when people recall experiences , they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed . recollection is thus the self - directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression . only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity , such as numbers and words . animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations . remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle believed the chain of thought , which ends in recollection of certain impressions , was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity , contrast , and contiguity , described in his laws of association . aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind . a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience . according to aristotle , association is the power innate in a mental state , which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences , allowing them to rise and be recalled . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness . sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion , so it is vital to the body . while a person is asleep , the critical activities , which include thinking , sensing , recalling and remembering , do not function as they do during wakefulness . since a person cannot sense during sleep they cannot have desire , which is the result of sensation . however , the senses are able to work during sleep , albeit differently , unless they are weary . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus . in dreams , sensation is still involved , but in an altered manner . aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water , and then looks away , the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion . when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention , it leaves an impression . when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly , a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored . however , during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences . so , dreams result from these lasting impressions . since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli , dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience . during sleep , a person is in an altered state of mind . aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus . for example , a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings . since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements , they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams , like the infatuated person . this leads the person to believe the dream is real , even when the dreams are absurd in nature . in de anima iii 3 , aristotle ascribes the ability to create , to store , and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination , phantasia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one component of aristotles theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs . he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being . aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences . aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it . if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred . secondly , any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream . for example , if , while a person is sleeping , a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut , this sensory experience is not part of the dream . lastly , the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics , politics , economics , and rhetoric . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study , that is , one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake . he wrote several treatises on ethics , including most notably , the nicomachean ethics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ( ergon ) of a thing . an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see , because the proper function of an eye is sight . aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans , and that this function must be an activity of the psuchē ( soul ) in accordance with reason ( logos ) . aristotle identified such an optimum activity ( the virtuous mean , between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency ) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action , eudaimonia , generally translated as " happiness " or sometimes " well - being " . to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ( ēthikē aretē ) , often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately , but by teachers , and experience , leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things . when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom ( phronesis ) and their intellect ( nous ) can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue , the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker , or in other words , a philosopher . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to his works on ethics , which address the individual , aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics . aristotle considered the city to be a natural community . moreover , he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual , " for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part " . he famously stated that " man is by nature a political animal " and argued that humanitys defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality . aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine , and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others . aristotles conception of the city is organic , and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotles understanding . although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires , the natural community according to aristotle was the city ( polis ) which functions as a political " community " or " partnership " ( koinōnia ) . the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability , but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life , and to perform beautiful acts : " the political partnership must be regarded , therefore , as being for the sake of noble actions , not for the sake of living together . " this is distinguished from modern approaches , beginning with social contract theory , according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of " fear of violent death " or its " inconveniences " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in protrepticus , the character ' aristotle ' states : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as platos disciple aristotle was rather skeptical concerning democracy and , following platos vague ideas , he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a so - called mixed state : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to illustrate this approach , aristotle proposed a first - of - its - kind mathematical model of voting , albeit textually described , where the democratic principle of " one voter–one vote " is combined with the oligarchic " merit - weighted voting " ; for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought , especially to thought in the middle ages . in politics , aristotle addresses the city , property , and trade . his response to criticisms of private property , in lionel robbinss view , anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists , as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements . aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society , and that although private property is often blamed for social strife , such evils in fact come from human nature . in politics , aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money . money came into use because people became dependent on one another , importing what they needed and exporting the surplus . for the sake of convenience , people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable , such as iron or silver . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the middle ages . he had a low opinion of retail , believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household , retail trade seeks to make a profit . it thus uses goods as a means to an end , rather than as an end unto itself . he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural . similarly , aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural , as it makes a gain out of the money itself , and not from its use . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time . he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth , the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement . money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them " commensurable " . he goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange , making it a sort of security . that is , " if we do not want a thing now , we shall be able to get it when we do want it " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience : ethos ( an appeal to the speakers character ) , pathos ( an appeal to the audiences emotion ) , and logos ( an appeal to logical reasoning ) . he also categorizes rhetoric into three genres : epideictic ( ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame ) , forensic ( judicial speeches over guilt or innocence ) , and deliberative ( speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue ) . aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs : enthymeme ( proof by syllogism ) and paradeigma ( proof by example ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry , tragedy , comedy , dithyrambic poetry , painting , sculpture , music , and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis ( " imitation " ) , each varying in imitation by medium , object , and manner . he applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artists intention and contends that the audiences realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself . aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry " follows the pattern of nature " . because of this , aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell calls " highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes . " for example , music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony , whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone , and poetry with language . the forms also differ in their object of imitation . comedy , for instance , is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average . lastly , the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while it is believed that aristotles poetics originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived . aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements : plot - structure , character , style , thought , spectacle , and lyric poetry . the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story ; and the plot , not the characters , is the chief focus of tragedy . tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear , and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions . aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which , if either , is superior : epic or tragic mimesis . he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic , possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music , is more unified , and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope , it can be considered superior to epic . aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles , folklore , and proverbs ; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the delphic oracle and studied the fables of aesop . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles analysis of procreation describes an active , ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert , passive female element . on this ground , proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism . however , aristotle gave equal weight to womens happiness as he did to mens , and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break more than 2300 years after his death , aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived . he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence , and he was the founder of many new fields . according to the philosopher bryan magee , " it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did " . among countless other achievements , aristotle was the founder of formal logic , pioneered the study of zoology , and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method . taneli kukkonen , writing in the classical tradition , observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched , and his reach in influencing " every branch of intellectual enterprise " including western ethical and political theory , theology , rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long . as a result , kukkonen argues , any analysis of reality today " will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind . " jonathan barnes wrote that " an account of aristotles intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of european thought " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotles pupil and successor , theophrastus , wrote the history of plants , a pioneering work in botany . some of his technical terms remain in use , such as carpel from carpos , fruit , and pericarp , from pericarpion , seed chamber . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was , instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the immediate influence of aristotles work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school . aristotles notable students included aristoxenus , dicaearchus , demetrius of phalerum , eudemos of rhodes , harpalus , hephaestion , mnason of phocis , nicomachus , and theophrastus . aristotles influence over alexander the great is seen in the latters bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists , botanists , and researchers . he had also learned a great deal about persian customs and traditions from his teacher . although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotles geography was clearly wrong , when the old philosopher released his works to the public , alexander complained " thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines ; for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all mens common property ? " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after theophrastus , the lyceum failed to produce any original work . though interest in aristotles ideas survived , they were generally taken unquestioningly . it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first medical teacher at alexandria , herophilus of chalcedon , corrected aristotle , placing intelligence in the brain , and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation . herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries , noting that the latter pulse while the former do not . though a few ancient atomists such as lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life , teleology ( and after the rise of christianity , natural theology ) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries . ernst mayr states that there was " nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus . the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus , elias , and david in the sixth century , and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century . john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotles views on the eternity of the world , movement , and other elements of aristotelian thought . philoponus questioned aristotles teaching of physics , noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after a hiatus of several centuries , formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries , apparently sponsored by anna comnena . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology . most of the still extant works of aristotle , as well as a number of the original greek commentaries , were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers , scientists and scholars . averroes , avicenna and alpharabius , who wrote on aristotle in great depth , also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers . alkindus greatly admired aristotles philosophy , and averroes spoke of aristotle as the " exemplar " for all future philosophers . medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the " first teacher " . the title " teacher " was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars , and was later used by western philosophers ( as in the famous poem of dante ) who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west , aristotle was practically unknown there from c . ad 600 to c . 1100 except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius . in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made , both from arabic translations , such as those by gerard of cremona , and from the original greek , such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke . after the scholastic thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica , working from moerbekes translations and calling aristotle " the philosopher " , the demand for aristotles writings grew , and the greek manuscripts returned to the west , stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance . these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity , bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages . scholars such as boethius , peter abelard , and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the medieval english poet chaucer describes his student as being happy by having uvmr_ev_paragraph_break twenty bookes , clad in blak or reed , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break of aristotle and his philosophie , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a cautionary medieval tale held that aristotle advised his pupil alexander to avoid the kings seductive mistress , phyllis , but was himself captivated by her , and allowed her to ride him . phyllis had secretly told alexander what to expect , and he witnessed phyllis proving that a womans charms could overcome even the greatest philosophers male intellect . artists such as hans baldung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the divine comedy : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break seder tra filosofica famiglia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tutti lo miran , tutti onor li fanno : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break quivi vid ' ïo socrate e platone uvmr_ev_paragraph_break che ' nnanzi a li altri più presso li stanno ; i saw the master there of those who know , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amid the philosophic family , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by all admired , and by all reverenced ; uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there plato too i saw , and socrates , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break who stood beside him closer than the rest . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break besides dantes fellow poets , the classical figure that most influenced the comedy is aristotle . dante built up the philosophy of the comedy with the works of aristotle as a foundation , just as the scholastics used aristotle as the basis for their thinking . dante knew aristotle directly from latin translations of his works and indirectly quotations in the works of albert magnus . dante even acknowledges aristotles influence explicitly in the poem , specifically when virgil justifies the infernos structure by citing the nicomachean ethics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break moses maimonides ( considered to be the foremost intellectual figure of medieval judaism ) adopted aristotelianism from the islamic scholars and based his guide for the perplexed on it and that became the basis of jewish scholastic philosophy . maimonides also considered aristotle to be the greatest philosopher that ever lived , and styled him as the " chief of the philosophers " . also , in his letter to samuel ibn tibbon , maimonides observes that there is no need for samuel to study the writings of philosophers who preceded aristotle because the works of the latter are " sufficient by themselves and superior to all that were written before them . his intellect , aristotles is the extreme limit of human intellect , apart from him upon whom the divine emanation has flowed forth to such an extent that they reach the level of prophecy , there being no level higher " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the early modern period , scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen , establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment . harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood , establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the bodys heat , as aristotle thought . galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotles physics , proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 19th - century german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle . aristotle rigidly separated action from production , and argued for the deserved subservience of some people ( " natural slaves " ) , and the natural superiority ( virtue , arete ) of others . it was martin heidegger , not nietzsche , who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle , intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotles logic , but decided " to go under , over , and beyond " it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book the laws of thought . this gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations , enables it to solve equations as well as check validity , and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms , not just two . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break charles darwin regarded aristotle as the most important contributor to the subject of biology . in an 1882 letter he wrote that " linnaeus and cuvier have been my two gods , though in very different ways , but they were mere schoolboys to old aristotle " . also , in later editions of the book " on the origin of species ' , darwin traced evolutionary ideas as far back as aristotle ; the text he cites is a summary by aristotle of the ideas of the earlier greek philosopher empedocles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break james joyces favoured philosopher was aristotle , whom he considered to be " the greatest thinker of all times " . samuel taylor coleridge said : everybody is born either a platonist or an aristotelian . ayn rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend " three as " —aristotle , aquinas , and ayn rand . she also regarded aristotle as the greatest of all philosophers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break karl marx considered aristotle to be the " greatest thinker of antiquity " , and called him a " giant thinker " , a " genius " , and " the great scholar " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the 20th century , aristotles work was widely criticized . the philosopher bertrand russell uvmr_ev_paragraph_break argued that " almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine " . russell called aristotles ethics " repulsive " , and labelled his logic " as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy " . russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle , until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the dutch historian of science eduard jan dijksterhuis wrote that aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by " proceeding so readily to frame a theory of such a general character " on limited evidence from their senses . in 1985 , the biologist peter medawar could still state in " pure seventeenth century " tones that aristotle had assembled " a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay , imperfect observation , wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility " . hobbes rejected one of the most famous theses of aristotles politics , namely that human beings are naturally suited to life in a polis and do not fully realize their natures until they exercise the role of citizen . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by the start of the 21st century , however , aristotle was taken more seriously : kukkonen noted that " in the best 20th - century scholarship aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition . " alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti - elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans . kukkonen observed , too , that " that most enduring of romantic images , aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander " remained current , as in the 2004 film alexander , while the " firm rules " of aristotles theory of drama have ensured a role for the poetics in hollywood . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break biologists continue to be interested in aristotles thinking . armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotles biology , while niko tinbergens four questions , based on aristotles four causes , are used to analyse animal behaviour ; they examine function , phylogeny , mechanism , and ontogeny . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum . these texts , as opposed to aristotles lost works , are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotles school . reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekkers royal prussian academy edition ( aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica , berlin , 1831–1870 ) , which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls , the common writing medium of that era . his writings are divisible into two groups : the " exoteric " , intended for the public , and the " esoteric " , for use within the lyceum school . aristotles " lost " works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus . whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication , the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication . ciceros description of aristotles literary style as " a river of gold " must have applied to the published works , not the surviving notes . a major question in the history of aristotles works is how the exoteric writings were all lost , and how the ones now possessed came to be found . the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotles school which existed in the form of smaller , separate works , distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics , edited them , and finally compiled them into the more cohesive , larger works as they are known today . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder , justus van gent , raphael , paolo veronese , jusepe de ribera , rembrandt , and francesco hayez over the centuries . among the best - known depictions is raphaels fresco the school of athens , in the vaticans apostolic palace , where the figures of plato and aristotle are central to the image , at the architectural vanishing point , reflecting their importance . rembrandts aristotle with a bust of homer , too , is a celebrated work , showing the knowing philosopher and the blind homer from an earlier age : as the art critic jonathan jones writes , " this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world , ensnaring us in its musty , glowing , pitch - black , terrible knowledge of time .

*********** Article 9: An American in Paris ***********

an american in paris is a jazz - influenced orchestral piece by american composer george gershwin first performed in 1928 . it was inspired by the time that gershwin had spent in paris and evokes the sights and energy of the french capital during the années folles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the symphony orchestra plus celesta , saxophones , and automobile horns . he brought back four parisian taxi horns for the new york premiere of the composition , which took place on december 13 , 1928 , in carnegie hall , with walter damrosch conducting the new york philharmonic . it was damrosch who had commissioned gershwin to write his concerto in f following the earlier success of rhapsody in blue ( 1924 ) . he completed the orchestration on november 18 , less than four weeks before the works premiere . he collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer deems taylor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although the story is likely apocryphal , gershwin is said to have been attracted by maurice ravels unusual chords , and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in 1926 ready to study with ravel . after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories , ravel said he could not teach him , saying , " why be a second - rate ravel when you can be a first - rate gershwin ? " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour . to this end , upon his return to new york , gershwin joined the efforts of ravels friend robert schmitz , a pianist ravel had met during the war , to urge ravel to tour the schmitz was the head of pro musica , promoting franco - american musical relations , and was able to offer ravel a 10000 fee for the tour , an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gershwin greeted ravel in new york in march 1928 during a party held for ravels birthday by éva gauthier . ravels tour reignited gershwins desire to return to paris , which he and his brother ira did after meeting ravel . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break key f major uvmr_ev_paragraph_break relative c uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acciaccatura b8mp ( c - . e4 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acciaccatura b ' 8 ( c - . e4 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acciaccatura b ' 8 ( c - . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break c c , 16 d e4 acciaccatura b ' 8 ( c - . e4 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acciaccatura b ' 8 ( c . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break g4 - gt ; ( f ) uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break clef bass uvmr_ev_paragraph_break partial 8 cis8 - gt ; f - markup italic scherzando uvmr_ev_paragraph_break dis - gt ; eis - gt ; fis - gt ; gis - gt ; uvmr_ev_paragraph_break eis4 - gt ; dis8 ( fis4 eis ) uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acciaccatura eis8 ( dis - . cis uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acciaccatura eis8 ( dis - . cis2 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called " very parisienne " , written in 1926 on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts , robert and mabel schirmer . gershwin called it " a rhapsodic ballet " ; it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gershwin explained in musical america , " my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city , listens to the various street noises , and absorbs the french atmosphere . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the piece is structured into five sections , which culminate in a loose aba format . gershwins first a episode introduces the two main " walking " themes in the " allegretto grazioso " and develops a third theme in the " subito con brio " . the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six . this a section featured duple meter , singsong rhythms , and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe , english horn , and taxi horns . the b sections " andante ma con ritmo deciso " introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness . the " allegro " that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster twelve - bar blues . in the b section , gershwin uses common time , syncopated rhythms , and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet , saxophone , and snare drum . " moderato con grazia " is the last a section that returns to the themes set in after recapitulating the " walking " themes , gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final " grandioso " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gershwin did not particularly like walter damroschs interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris . he stated that damroschs sluggish , dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work . the audience , according to edward cushing , responded with " a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music , good and bad , ordinarily arouses . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than gershwins concerto in some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers césar franck , richard wagner , or guillaume lekeu on its premiere . gershwin responded to the critics : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an american in paris was originally scored for 3 flutes ( 3rd doubling on piccolo ) , 2 oboes , english horn , 2 clarinets in b - flat , bass clarinet in b - flat , 2 bassoons , contrabassoon , 4 horns in f , 3 trumpets in b - flat , 3 trombones , tuba , timpani , snare drum , bass drum , triangle , wood block , ratchet , cymbals , low and high tom - toms , xylophone , glockenspiel , celesta , 4 taxi horns labeled as a , b , c , and d with circles around them , alto saxophone , tenor saxophone , baritone saxophone ( all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones ) , and strings . although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a , b , c , and d , it had been gershwins intention to use the notes a4 , b4 , d5 , and a4 . it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a , b , c , and d with circles , he was referring to the four horns , and not the notes that they played . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a major revision of the work by composer and arranger campbell - watson simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments : alto , tenor and baritone . the soprano saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments , and the contrabassoon was also deleted . this became the standard performing edition until 2000 , when gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris , working directly from gershwins original manuscript , including the restoration of gershwins soprano saxophone parts removed in campbell - watsons revision . gibbons ' restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at londons queen elizabeth hall on july 9 , 2000 , by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break william daly arranged the score for piano solo ; this was published by new world music in 1929 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on september 22 , 2013 , it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score would be eventually released . the gershwin family , working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan , were working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwins true intent . it was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work ( such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section ) , or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during gershwins composition process . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the score to an american in paris was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released . the entire project was expected to take 30 to 40 years to complete , but an american in paris was planned to be an early volume in the series . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break two urtext editions of the work were published by the german publisher b - note music in 2015 . the changes made by campbell - watson were withdrawn in both editions . in the extended urtext , 120 bars of music were re - integrated . conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on september 9 , 2017 , the cincinnati symphony orchestra gave the world premiere of the long - awaited critical edition of the piece prepared by mark clague , director of the gershwin initiative at the university of michigan . this performance was of the original 1928 orchestration , an alteration usually attributed to campbell - watson . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an american in paris has been frequently recorded . the first recording was made for the victor talking machine company in 1929 with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra , drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra . gershwin was on hand to " supervise " the recording ; however , shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio . then , a little later , shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section , so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the solo ; gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording . this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a - flat , b - flat , a higher d , and a lower uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the radio broadcast of the september 8 , 1937 , hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert , in which an american in paris , also conducted by shilkret , was second on the program , was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two - cd set . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor , including one of the first stereo recordings of the music . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1945 , arturo toscanini conducting the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the piece for rca victor , one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the seattle symphony also recorded a version in 1990 of gershwins original score , before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break harry james released a version of the blues section on his 1953 album one night stand , recorded live at the aragon ballroom in chicago ( columbia gl 522 and cl 522 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1951 , metro - goldwyn - mayer released the musical film , an american in paris , featuring gene kelly and leslie caron . winning the 1951 best picture oscar , and numerous other awards , the film was directed by vincente minnelli , featured many tunes of gershwin , and concluded with an extensive , elaborate dance sequence built around the an american in paris symphonic poem ( arranged for the film by johnny green ) , costing 500000 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

*********** Article 11: Academy Awards ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the academy awards , popularly known as the oscars , are awards for artistic and technical merit in the film industry . they are regarded by many as the most prestigious and significant awards in the entertainment industry worldwide . given annually by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ( ampas ) , the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements , as assessed by the academys voting membership . the various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette as a trophy , officially called the " academy award of merit " , although more commonly referred to by its nickname , the " oscar " . the statuette depicts a knight rendered in the art deco style . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the award was originally sculpted by george stanley from a design sketch by cedric gibbons . ampas first presented it in 1929 at a private dinner hosted by douglas fairbanks in the hollywood roosevelt hotel in what would become known as the 1st academy awards . the academy awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in 1930 and was televised for the first time in 1953 . it is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide . a total of 3140 oscar statuettes have been awarded since its inception in 1929 . they are widely cited as the most prestigious and renowned competitive awards in the field of entertainment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first academy awards presentation was held on may 16 , 1929 , at a private dinner function at the hollywood roosevelt hotel with an audience of about 270 people . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the post - awards party was held at the mayfair hotel . the cost of guest tickets for that nights ceremony was 5 ( at 2020 prices ) . fifteen statuettes were awarded , honoring artists , directors and other participants in the film - making industry of the time , for their works during the 1927–28 period . the ceremony ran for 15minutes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for this first ceremony , winners were announced to the media three months earlier . for the second ceremony in 1930 , and the rest of the first decade , the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11 : 00pm on the night of the awards . in 1940 , the los angeles times announced the winners before the ceremony began ; as a result , the following year the academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first best actor awarded was emil jannings , for his performances in the last command and the way of all flesh . he had to return to europe before the ceremony , so the academy agreed to give him the prize earlier ; this made him the first academy award winner in history . at that time , winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying period ; for example , jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period , and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films with the fourth ceremony , however , the system changed , and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film . for the first six ceremonies , the eligibility period spanned two calendar years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the 29th ceremony , held in 1957 , the best foreign language film category , now known as best international feature film , was introduced . until then , foreign - language films had been honored with the special achievement award . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break perhaps the most widely seen streaker in history was 34 - year - old robert opel , who streaked across the stage of the dorothy chandler pavilion in los angeles flashing a peace sign on national us television at the 46th academy awards in 1974 . bemused host david niven quipped , " isnt it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his shortcomings ? " later , evidence arose suggesting that opels appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the shows producer jack haley jr . robert metzler , the shows business manager , believed that the incident had been planned in some way ; during the dress rehearsal niven had asked metzlers wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line , which was thus not the ad - lib it appeared to be . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 74th academy awards , held in 2002 , presented the first academy award for best animated feature . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 1973 to 2020 , all academy awards ceremonies have ended with the academy award for best picture . for 2021 , this tradition was broken as the ceremony ended with the academy award for best actor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break traditionally , the previous years winner for best actor and best supporting actor present the awards for best actress and best supporting actress , while the previous years winner for best actress and best supporting actress present the awards for best actor and best supporting actor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on february 9 , 2020 , parasite became the first foreign - language film to win best picture at the award ceremony of 92nd academy awards . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tom hanks announced at the 2020 oscar ceremony , the opening of the academy museum of motion pictures on december 14 , 2020 . the museum development started in 2017 under kerry brougher , but is now led by bill kramer . the industry curated exhibits will be geared toward the history of motion picture , the art science of film making , exhibiting trailblazing directors , actors , film - makers , sound editors and more , and will house famous artifacts from acclaimed movies like dorothys ruby red slippers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 93rd academy awards ceremony , honoring the best films of 2020 and early 2021 , was held on april 25 , 2021 , after it was postponed from its original february 28 , 2021 , schedule due to the impact of the covid - 19 pandemic on cinema . as with two previous ceremonies , there was no host . the ceremony was broadcast on abc . it took place at the dolby theatre in los angeles , california for the 19th consecutive year , along with satellite location taking place at the union station also in los angeles . because of the virus impact on films and tv industries , academy president david rubin and ceo dawn hudson announced that for the 2021 oscar ceremony , streaming movies not shown in theaters would be eligible , though at some point the requirement that movies be shown in theaters would return . in 2022 , famous indian film producer stated that film actor vijay has the potential and talent to win oscars best international actor award for his black comedy action hit film beast and make indian tamil cinema proud . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the best known award is the academy award of merit , more popularly known as the oscar statuette . made of gold - plated bronze on a black metal base , it is 13in ( 34cm ) tall , weighs 8lb ( 3kg ) , and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes . the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy : actors , writers , directors , producers , and technicians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sculptor george stanley ( who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl ) sculpted cedric gibbons ' design . the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold - plated solid bronze . within a few years , the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal , a pewter - like alloy which is then plated in copper , nickel silver , and finally , 24 - karat gold . the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base . the original oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the shumway sons foundry in batavia , illinois , which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy awards statuettes . from 1983 to 2015 , approximately 50 oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer owens company . it would take between three and four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes . in 2016 , the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes , handing manufacturing duties to walden , new york - based polich tallix fine art foundry . while based on a digital scan of an original 1929 oscar , the statuettes retain their modern - era dimensions and black pedestal . cast in liquid bronze from 3d - printed ceramic molds and polished , they are then electroplated in 24 - karat gold by brooklyn , new york–based epner technology . the time required to produce 50 such statuettes is roughly three months . owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars that need replating . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the academy officially adopted the name " oscar " for the trophies in 1939 . however , the origin of the nickname is disputed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one biography of bette davis , who was a president of the academy in 1941 , claims she named the award after her first husband , band leader harmon oscar nelson . a frequently mentioned originator is margaret herrick , the academy executive director , who , when she first saw the award in 1931 , said the statuette reminded her of " uncle oscar " , a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break columnist sidney skolsky , who was present during herricks naming in 1931 , wrote that " employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette ' oscar ' . " the academy credits skolsky with " the first confirmed newspaper reference " to oscar in his column on march 16 , 1934 , which was written about that years 6th academy awards . the 1934 awards appeared again in another early media mention of oscar : a time magazine story . in the ceremonies that year , walt disney was the first to thank the academy for his " oscar " during his acceptance speech . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony , oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates . until 2010 , winners returned their statuettes to the academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective oscars . since 2010 , winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an inscription - processing station at the governors ball , a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony . the owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony , bearing the name of every potential winner . the nameplates for the non - winning nominees are later recycled . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break prior to 1950 , oscar statuettes were ( and remain ) the property of the recipient . since then the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the academy for us1 . if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation , then the academy keeps the statuette . academy awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six - figure sums uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1989 , michael todds grandson tried to sell todds best picture oscar for his 1956 production of around the world in 80 days to a movie prop collector . the academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1992 , harold russell consigned his 1946 oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to auction to raise money for his wifes medical expenses . though his decision caused controversy , the first - ever oscar to be sold passed to a private collector on august 6 , 1992 for 60500 ( today ) . russell defended his action , saying , " i dont know why anybody would be critical . my wifes health is much more important than sentimental reasons . the movie will be here , even if oscar isnt . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in december 2011 , orson welles ' 1941 oscar for citizen kane ( academy award for best original screenplay ) was put up for auction , after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy . on december 20 , 2011 , it sold in an online auction for us861542 ( today ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the academy , which keeps them in its treasury . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to the academy award of merit ( oscar award ) , there are nine honorary ( non - competitive ) awards presented by the academy from time to time ( except for the academy honorary award , the technical achievement award , and the student academy awards , which are presented annually ) : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the academy also awards nicholl fellowships in screenwriting . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 2004 to 2020 , the academy award nomination results were announced to the public in mid - january . prior to that , the results were announced in early february . in 2021 , the nominees were announced in march . in 2022 , the nominees were announced in early february for the first time since 2003 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the academy of motion picture arts and sciences ( ampas ) , a professional honorary organization , maintains a voting membership of over 7000 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break academy membership is divided into different branches , with each representing a different discipline in film production . actors constitute the largest voting bloc , numbering 1311 members ( 22 percent ) of the academys composition . votes have been certified by the auditing firm pricewaterhousecoopers ( and its predecessor price waterhouse ) since the 7th academy awards in 1935 . the firm mails the ballots of eligible nominees to members of the academy in december to reflect the previous eligible year with a due date sometime in january of the next year , then tabulates the votes in a process that takes thousands of hours . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all ampas members must be invited to join by the board of governors , on behalf of academy branch executive committees . membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contributions to the field of motion pictures . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break new membership proposals are considered annually . the academy does not publicly disclose its membership , although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join . the 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6000 voting members . while the membership had been growing , stricter policies have kept its size steady since then . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2012 , the results of a study conducted by the los angeles times were published describing the demographic breakdown of approximately 88 of ampas ' voting membership . of the 5100 active voters confirmed , 94 were caucasian , 77 were male , and 54 were found to be over the age of 60 . 33 of voting members are former nominees ( 14 ) and winners ( 19 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in may 2011 , the academy sent a letter advising its 6000 or so voting members that an online system for oscar voting would be implemented in 2013 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to rules 2 and 3 of the official academy awards rules , a film must open in the previous calendar year , from midnight at the start of january 1 to midnight at the end of december 31 , in los angeles county , california , and play for seven consecutive days , to qualify ( except for the best international feature film , best documentary feature , and awards in short film categories ) . additionally , the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run , with at least one of the daily showings starting between 6pm and 10pm local time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for example , the 2009 best picture winner , the hurt locker , was originally first released in 2008 , but did not qualify for the 2008 awards , as it did not play its oscar - qualifying run in los angeles until mid - 2009 , thus qualifying for the 2009 awards . foreign films must include english subtitles , and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the international feature film category per year . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rule 2 states that a film must be feature - length , defined as a minimum of 40minutes , except for short - subject awards , and it must exist either on a 35 mm or 70 mm film print or in 24frame / s or 48frame / s progressive scan digital cinema format with a minimum projector resolution of 2048 by 1080 pixels . since the 90th academy awards , presented in 2018 , multi - part and limited series have been ineligible for the best documentary feature award . this followed the win of : made in america , an eight - hour presentation that was screened in a limited release before being broadcast in five parts on abc and espn , in that category in 2017 . the academys announcement of the new rule made no direct mention of that film . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the best international feature film award does not require a release . it requires the film to be submitted as its countrys official selection . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the best documentary feature award requires either week - long releases in both los angeles county and new york city during the previous calendar year , or a qualifying award at a competitive film festival from the documentary feature qualifying festival list ( regardless of any public exhibition or distribution ) , or submission in the international feature film category as its countrys official selection . the qualifying theatrical runs must meet the same requirements as those for non - documentary films regarding numbers and times of screenings . additionally , a film must have been reviewed by a critic from the new york times , time out new york , the los angeles times , or la weekly . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break producers must submit an official screen credits online form before the deadline ; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline , the film will be ineligible for academy awards in any year . the form includes the production credits for all related categories . then , each form is checked and put in a reminder list of eligible releases . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break awards in short film categories ( best documentary short subject , best animated short film , and best live action short film ) have noticeably different eligibility rules from most other competitive awards . first , the qualifying period for release does not coincide with a calendar year , instead of covering one year starting on october 1 and ending on september 30 of the calendar year before the ceremony . second , there are multiple methods of qualification . the main method is a week - long theatrical release in either los angeles county or new york city during the eligibility period . films also can qualify by winning specified awards at one of several competitive film festivals designated by the academy , also without regard to prior public distribution . finally , a film that is selected as a gold , silver , or bronze medal winner in an appropriate category of the immediately previous student academy awards is also eligible ( documentary category for that award , and animation , narrative , alternative , or international for the other awards ) . the requirements for the qualifying theatrical run are also different from those for other awards . only one screening per day is required . for the documentary award , the screening must start between noon and 10pm local time ; for other awards , no specific start time is required , but the film must appear in regular theater listings with dates and screening times . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in late december , ballots , and copies of the reminder list of eligible releases are mailed to around 6000 active members . for most categories , members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories ( that is only directors vote for directors , writers for writers , actors for actors , etcetera ) . in the special case of best picture , all voting members are eligible to select the nominees . in all major categories , a variant of the single transferable vote is used , with each member casting a ballot with up to five nominees ( ten for best picture ) ranked preferentially . in certain categories , including international feature film , documentary and animated feature , nominees are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in most categories , the winner is selected from among the nominees by plurality voting of all members . since 2013 , re - weighted range voting has been used to select the nominees for the best visual effects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for best picture , in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season . the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified . it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders . for example , a producer of the 2009 best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the front - runner ( the hurt locker eventually won ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the academy screening room or academy digital screening room is a secure streaming platform which allows voting members of the academy to view all eligible films ( except , initially , those in the international category ) in one place . it was introduced in 2019 , for the 2020 oscars , though dvd screeners and academy in - person screenings were still provided . for films to be included on the platform , the north american distributor must pay 12500 , including a watermarking fee , and a digital copy of the film to be prepared for streaming by the academy . the platform can be accessed via apple tv and roku players . the watermarking process involved several video security firms , creating a forensic watermark and restricting the ability to take screenshots or screen recordings . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2021 , for the 2022 oscars , the academy banned all physical screeners and in - person screenings , restricting official membership viewing to the academy screening room . films eligible in the documentary and international categories were made available in different sections of the platform . distributors can also pay an extra fee to add video featurettes to promote their films on the platform . the in - person screenings were said to be cancelled because of the covid - 19 pandemic . eligible films do not have to be added to the platform , but the academy advertises them to voting members when they are . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony , commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year , and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees . it is the culmination of the film awards season , which usually begins during november or december of the previous year . this is an elaborate extravaganza , with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day . black tie dress is the most common outfit for men , although fashion may dictate not wearing a bow - tie , and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this . ( the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony , and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the academy awards is the worlds longest - running awards show televised live from the to all - time zones in north america and worldwide , and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world . the oscars were first televised in 1953 by nbc , which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 , when abc took over , televising the festivities ( including the first color broadcast of the event in 1966 ) through 1970 . nbc regained the rights for five years then abc resumed broadcast duties in 1976 and its current contract with the academy runs through 2028 . the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets ( especially those outside of the americas ) in more desirable local timeslots . the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since 1970 , but only two south american countries , chile and brazil , purchased the rights to air the broadcast . by that time , the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in 50 countries . a decade later , the rights were already being sold to 60 countries , and by 1984 , the tv rights to the awards were licensed in 76 countries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ceremonies were moved up from late march / early april to late february , since 2004 , to help disrupt and shorten the intense lobbying and ad campaigns associated with oscar season in the film industry . another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa basketball tournament , which would cut into the academy awards audience . ( in 1976 and 1977 , abcs regained oscars were moved from tuesday to monday and went directly opposite nbcs ncaa title game . the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc , as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period . some years , the ceremony is moved into the first sunday of march to avoid a clash with the winter olympic games . another reason for the move to late february and early march is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter , which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public . advertising is somewhat restricted , however , as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast . the production of the academy awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most emmys in history , with 47 wins and 195 nominations overall since that awards own launch in 1949 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after many years of being held on mondays at 9 : 00pm eastern / 6 : 00 p . pacific , since the 1999 ceremonies , it was moved to sundays at 8 : 30pm et / 5 : 30pm pt . the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays , that los angeles rush - hour traffic jams could be avoided , and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier . for many years the film industry opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office . in 2010 , the academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january , citing tv viewers ' fatigue with the film industrys long awards season . however , such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members , to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers ( as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail ) . furthermore , a january ceremony on sunday would clash with national football league playoff games . in 2018 , the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to mid february beginning with the 92nd academy awards in 2020 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break originally scheduled for april 8 , 1968 , the 40th academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days , because of the assassination of dr . martin luther king , jr . on march 30 , 1981 , the 53rd academy awards was postponed for one day , after the shooting of president ronald reagan and others in washington , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1993 , an in memoriam segment was introduced , honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months , a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members . this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names . criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect , with the segment having a " popularity contest " feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subjects cultural impact ; the applause has since been muted during the telecast , and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead . this segment was later followed by a commercial break . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in terms of broadcast length , the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours . the first oscars , in 1929 , lasted 15minutes . at the other end of the spectrum , the 2002 ceremony lasted four hours and twenty - three minutes . in 2010 , the organizers of the academy awards announced winners ' acceptance speeches must not run past 45seconds . this , according to organizer bill mechanic , was to ensure the elimination of what he termed " the single most hated thing on the show " – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion . in 2016 , in a further effort to streamline speeches , winners ' dedications were displayed on an on - screen ticker . during the 2018 ceremony , host jimmy kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become , by announcing that he would give a brand - new jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night ( a reward won by mark bridges when accepting his best costume design award for phantom thread ) . the wall street journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the 2014–2018 telecasts as follows : 14 on song performances ; 25 on the hosts ' speeches ; 38 on prerecorded clips ; and 78 on the awards themselves , broken into 24 on the introduction and announcement , 24 on winners walking to the stage , and 30 on their acceptance speeches . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although still dominant in ratings , the viewership of the academy awards has steadily dropped ; the 88th academy awards were the lowest - rated in the past eight years ( although with increases in male and 18–49 viewership ) , while the show itself also faced mixed reception . following the show , variety reported that abc was , in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars , seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself . currently and nominally , ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast , including the choice of production staff and hosting , although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions . in august 2016 , ampas extended its contract with abc through 2028 : the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break historically , the telecasts viewership is higher when box - office hits are favored to win the best picture award . more than 57million viewers tuned to the telecast for the 70th academy awards in 1998 , the year of titanic , which generated a box office haul during its initial 1997–98 run of us600million in the us , a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years . the 76th academy awards ceremony , in which the lord of the rings : the return of the king ( pre - telecast box office earnings of us368million ) received 11 awards including best picture , drew 43million viewers . the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date , however , was the 42nd academy awards ( best picture midnight cowboy ) which drew a 43 household rating on april 7 , 1970 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by contrast , ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings , despite how much critical acclaim those films have received . the 78th academy awards which awarded low - budget independent film crash ( with a pre - oscar gross of us53million ) generated an audience of 38million with a household rating of 22 . in 2008 , the 80th academy awards telecast was watched by 31million viewers on average with an 18 household rating , the lowest - rated and least - watched ceremony at the time , in spite of celebrating 80 years of the academy awards . the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film ( no country for old men ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break whereas the 92nd academy awards drew an average of 23million viewers , the 93rd academy awards drew an even lower viewership of 10million . that is the lowest viewership recorded by nielsen since it started recording audience totals in 1974 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the academy film archive holds copies of every academy awards ceremony since the 1949 oscars and material on many prior ceremonies , along with ancillary material related to more recent shows . copies are held in a variety of film , video , and digital formats . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1929 , the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel . from 1930 to 1943 , the ceremony alternated between two venues : the ambassador hotel on wilshire boulevard and the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break graumans chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946 , followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from 1947 to 1948 . the 21st academy awards in 1949 were held at the academy award theatre at what had been the academys headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 1950 to 1960 , the awards were presented at hollywoods pantages theatre . with the advent of television , the awards from 1953 to 1957 took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york , first at the nbc international theatre ( 1953 ) and then at the nbc century theatre , after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles . the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica , california , in 1961 . by 1969 , the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to downtown los angeles , this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles county music center . in the late 1990s and early 2000s , the ceremony returned to the shrine . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2002 , hollywoods dolby theatre ( previously known as the kodak theatre ) became the presentations current venue . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the first year of the awards , the best directing award was split into two categories ( drama and comedy ) . at times , the best original score award has also been split into separate categories ( drama and comedy / musical ) . from the 1930s through the 1960s , the art direction ( now production design ) , cinematography , and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories ( black - and - white films and color films ) . prior to 2012 , the production design award was called art direction , while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in august 2018 , the academy announced that several categories would not be televised live , but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following dissent from academy members , they announced that they would indeed air all 24 categories live . this followed several proposals ( among them , the introduction of a popular film category ) that the academy had announced but did not implement . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories . to date , the following categories have been proposed : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the special academy awards are voted on by special committees , rather than by the academy membership as a whole . they are not always presented on an annual basis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards , many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the " oscar season " . this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality . william friedkin , an academy award - winning film director and former producer of the ceremony , expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in 2009 , describing it as " the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tim dirks , editor of amcs filmsite . rg , has written of the academy awards : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a recent technique that has been claimed to be used during the oscar season is the whisper campaign . these campaigns are intended to spread negative perceptions of other movies nominated and are believed to be perpetrated by those that were involved in creating the movie . examples of whisper campaigns include the allegations against zero dark thirty suggesting that it justifies torture and the claim that lincoln distorts history . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over - representation of romantic historical epics , biographical dramas , romantic dramedies and family melodramas , most of which are released in the in the last three months of the calendar year . the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded . the term " oscar bait " was coined to describe such movies . this has led , at times , to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience , for example , by favoring " oscar bait " over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees . this criticism is based on the statistics from every academy awards since 1929 , which shows us that only 6 of academy award nominees have been non - white and since 1991 , 11 of nominees have been non - white , with the rate of winners being even more polarizing . due to a variety of reasons , including marketability and historical bans on interracial couples , a number of high - profile oscars have been given to yellowface portrayals , as well as performances of asian characters rewritten for white characters . the 88th awards ceremony became the target of a boycott , popularized on social media with the hashtag oscarssowhite , based on activists ' perception that its all - white acting nominee list reflected bias . in response , the academy initiated " historic " changes in membership by 2020 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity , to make up for a " snub " for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one awarded , or presented as a " career honor " to recognize a distinguished nominees entire body of work . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following the 91st academy awards in february 2019 in which the netflix - broadcast film roma had been nominated for ten awards including the best picture category , steven spielberg and other members of the academy discussed changing the requirements through the board of governors for films as to exclude those from netflix and other media streaming services . spielberg had been concerned that netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical oscar - winning films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other best picture - nominated films , while still being able to meet the minimal theatrical - run status to qualify for an oscar . the united states department of justice , having heard of this potential rule change , wrote a letter to the academy in march 2019 , cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise anti - trust concerns against the academy . following its april 2019 board meeting , the academy board of governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the 94th academy awards on march 27 , 2022 , chris rock joked about jada pinkett smiths shaved head , with a jane reference . will smith walked onstage and slapped rock across the face , then returned to his seat and told rock , twice , to " keep my wifes name out of your fucking mouth ! " while later accepting the best actor award for king richard , smith apologized to the academy and the other nominees , but not to rock . rock decided not to press charges against smith . on april 8 , 2022 , the academy made an announcement on a letter sent by president david rubin and ceo dawn hudson informing the public that will smith is banned from the oscars for 10 years in result from the slap . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars . the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols ( best writing in 1935 for the informer ) . nichols boycotted the 8th academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers ' guild . nichols eventually accepted the 1935 award three years later , at the 1938 ceremony . nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break george scott became the second person to refuse his award ( best actor in 1970 for patton ) at the 43rd academy awards ceremony . scott described it as a " meat parade " , saying , " i dont want any part of it . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando , who refused his award ( best actor for 1972 ' s the godfather ) , citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of native americans . at the 45th academy awards ceremony , brando asked actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read a 15 - page speech in his place , detailing his criticisms , for which there was booing and cheering by the audience . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break six films have had nominations revoked before the official award ceremony : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one film was disqualified after winning the award , and had the winner return the oscar : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one film had its nomination revoked after the award ceremony when it had not won the oscar : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some advocates of gender equality and non - binary people have criticized the separation of male and female acting categories in the academy awards , emmy awards and tony awards . though some commentators worry that gender discrimination would cause men to dominate unsegregated categories , other categories are unsegregated . the grammy awards went gender - neutral in 2012 , while the daytime emmy awards introduced a single outstanding younger performer in a drama series category in 2019 to replace their two gender - specific younger actor and actress categories . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the following events are closely associated with the annual academy awards : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the oscars . in recent years , these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners . the value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars . in 2014 , the value was reported to be as high as us80000 . the value has risen to the point where the internal revenue service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to hawaii and mexico and japan , a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant , videophones , a four - night stay at a hotel , watches , bracelets , spa treatments , bottles of vodka , maple salad dressing , weight - loss gummie candy and up to 25000 worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from new york city facial plastic surgeon konstantin vasyukevich . some of the gifts have even had a " risque " element to them ; in 2014 , the adult products retailer adam eve had a " secret room gifting suite " . celebrities visiting the gifting suite included judith hoag , carolyn hennesy , kate linder , chris mulkey , jim oheir , and john

*********** Article 14: International Atomic Time ***********

international atomic time ( tai , from the french name temps atomique international ) is a high - precision atomic coordinate time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on earths geoid . it is a continuous scale of time , without leap seconds . it is the principal realisation of terrestrial time ( with a fixed offset of epoch ) . it is also the basis for coordinated universal time ( utc ) , which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earths surface . utc deviates from tai by a number of whole seconds . , when another leap second was put into effect , utc is currently exactly 37 seconds behind tai . the 37 seconds result from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972 , plus 27 leap seconds in utc since 1972 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days , carried over from non - uniform time standards based on the rotation of the earth . specifically , both julian days and the gregorian calendar are used . tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of 1958 , and the two have drifted apart ever since , due to the changing motion of the earth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over 400 atomic clocks in over 50 national laboratories worldwide . ite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the participating institutions each broadcast , in real time , a frequency signal with timecodes , which is their estimate of tai . time codes are usually published in the form of utc , which differs from tai by a well - known integer number of seconds . these time scales are denoted in the form utc ( npl ) in the utc form , where npl identifies the national physical laboratory , uk . the tai form may be denoted tai ( npl ) . the latter is not to be confused with ta ( npl ) , which denotes an independent atomic time scale , not synchronised to tai or to anything else . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other . the international bureau of weights and measures ( bipm , france ) , combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible . this combined time scale is published monthly in " circular t " , and is the canonical tai . this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc − utc ( k ) ( equivalent to tai − tai ( k ) ) for each participating institution k . the same circular also gives tables of tai − ta ( k ) , for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular aside from this , once published in circular t , the tai scale is not revised . in hindsight , it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale . since the published circulars are definitive , better estimates do not create another version of tai ; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time ( tt ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock ; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously . atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955 , using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory , uk ( npl ) . it was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the royal greenwich observatory and to establish a time scale , called greenwich atomic ( ga ) . the united states naval observatory began the 1 scale on 13 september 1956 , using an atomichron commercial atomic clock , followed by the nbs - a scale at the national bureau of standards , boulder , colorado on 9 october 1957 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the international time bureau ( bih ) began a time scale , tm or am , in july 1955 , using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals . the bih scale , 1 , and nbs - a were defined by an epoch at the beginning of 1958 the procedures used by the bih evolved , and the name for the time scale changed : " a3 " in 1964 and " ta ( bih ) " in 1969 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967 . from 1971 to 1975 the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee for weights and measures made a series of decisions which designated the bipm time scale international atomic time ( tai ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 1970s , it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation , and the combined tai scale , therefore , corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks . starting from the julian date 2443144 ( 1 january 1977 00 : 00 : 00 ) , corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks , so that tai would correspond to proper time at the geoid ( mean sea level ) . because the clocks were , on average , well above sea level , this meant that tai slowed by about one part in a trillion . the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal ( échelle atomique libre , meaning free atomic scale ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time ( tcb ) , geocentric coordinate time ( tcg ) , and terrestrial time ( tt ) , which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system . all three of these time scales were defined to read jd 2443144 ( 1 january 1977 00 : 00 : 32 ) exactly at that instant . tai was henceforth a realisation of tt , with the equation tt ( tai ) tai 32s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the continued existence of tai was questioned in a 2007 letter from the bipm to the itu - r which stated , " in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds , the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai , as it would remain parallel to the continuous utc . " cite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break utc is a discontinuous time scale . it is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds . between these adjustments , it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time . from its beginning in 1961 through december 1971 , the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated ut2 . afterward , these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate ut1 . this was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time scale . the less frequent whole - second adjustments meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally . the fact that it continues to approximate ut1 means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 15: Altruism ***********

altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for happiness of other human beings or other animals , resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual . it is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious and secular worldviews . however , the object ( s ) of concern vary among cultures and religions . in an extreme case , altruism may become a synonym of selflessness , which is the opposite of selfishness . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word " altruism " was popularized ( and possibly coined ) by the french philosopher auguste comte in french , as altruisme , for an antonym of egoism . he derived it from the italian altrui , which in turn was derived from latin alteri , meaning " other people " or " somebody else " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break altruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves ( for example , pleasure and quality of life , time , probability of survival or reproduction ) , but benefits , either directly or indirectly , another individual , without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action . steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting , that is " intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards " . in one sense , the opposite of altruism is spite ; a spiteful action harms another with no self - benefit . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty or concern for the common good . the latter are predicated upon social relationships , whilst altruism does not consider relationships . much debate exists as to whether " true " altruism is possible in human psychology . the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing , helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic , as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification . the validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as " benefits " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others . used in this sense , it is usually contrasted with egoism , which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first . effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the concept has a long history in philosophical and ethical thought . the term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science , auguste comte , and has become a major topic for psychologists ( especially evolutionary psychology researchers ) , evolutionary biologists , and ethologists . whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields , the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism . in simple terms , altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break marcel mausss essay the gift contains a passage called " note on alms " . this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms ( and by extension of altruism ) from the notion of sacrifice . in it , he writes : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand , and of a notion of sacrifice , on the other . generosity is an obligation , because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it . this is the ancient morality of the gift , which has become a principle of justice . the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the science of ethology ( the study of animal behaviour ) , and more generally in the study of social evolution , altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor . in evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity , emergency aid , help to coalition partners , tipping , courtship gifts , production of public goods , and environmentalism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins . two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some of the proposed mechanisms are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break where does good come from ? 17 april 2011 , http : / / www . oston . om / bostonglobe / ideas / articles / 2011 / 04 / 17 / wheredoesgoodcomefrom / uvmr_ev_paragraph_break such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts . instead , evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms , such as emotions , that promote altruistic behaviors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness ; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment . this need not imply that on average 50 or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment ; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups . research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no - kin , to friends than to strangers , to those attractive than to those unattractive , to non - competitors than to competitors , and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george prices development of the price equation , which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution . an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds , such as dictyostelium mucoroides . these protists live as individual amoebae until starved , at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds , and associated emotional , cognitive , and neurohormonal mechanisms , evolved in order to facilitate long - term , high - cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left - wing politics such by the russian zoologist and anarchist peter kropotkin in his 1902 book mutual aid : a factor of evolution and moral philosopher peter singer in his book a darwinian left . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break jorge moll and jordan grafman , neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and labs - dor hospital network ( ) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers , using functional magnetic resonance imaging . in their research , published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october 2006 , they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic reward pathway , a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex . however , when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations , another brain circuit was selectively activated : the subgenual cortex / septal region . these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species . altruism , the experiment suggested , was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain , hard - wired and pleasurable . ite news uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in fact , in an experiment published in march 2007 at the university of southern california neuroscientist antonio damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers , and that when confronted with moral dilemmas , these brain - damaged patients coldly came up with " end - justifies - the - means " answers , leading damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions , but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue – in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city – these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains . according to adrian raine , a clinical neuroscientist also at the university of southern california , one of this studys implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people : " psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse . without that awareness , people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets . does that mean they should be held to different standards of accountability ? " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in another study , in the 1990s , dr . bill harbaugh , a university of oregon economist , concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fmri scanner test in 2007 with his psychologist colleague dr . ulrich mayr , reached the same conclusions of jorge moll and jordan grafman about giving to charity , although they were able to divide the study group into two groups : " egoists " and " altruists " . one of their discoveries was that , though rarely , even some of the considered " egoists " sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others , leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity , such as a persons environment and values . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as " a motivational state with the goal of increasing anothers welfare " . psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism , which refers to the motivation to increase ones own welfare . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism . some definitions specify a self - sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors . however , because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases , the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question . the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self . daniel batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory . he identified four major motives : to ultimately benefit the self ( egoism ) , to ultimately benefit the other person ( altruism ) , to benefit a group ( collectivism ) , or to uphold a moral principle ( principlism ) . altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism , but the general conclusion has been that empathy - induced altruism can be genuinely selfless . the empathy - altruism hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering . feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress , which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions and increase their own positive ones through helping someone in need . empathy is thus not selfless , since altruism works either as the way to avoid those negative , unpleasant feelings and have positive , pleasant feelings triggered by others ' need for help , or as the way to incentive the gain of social reward or through fear to avoid social punishment by helping . people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided , whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to anothers suffering . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in psychological research on altruism , studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping , comforting , sharing , cooperation , philanthropy , and community service . however , a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism ( as a form of altruism ) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well - being . in a study of older adults , those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live , and lower in depression , anxiety , and somatization . volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health , but physical health and longevity as well , attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages . one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30 - year period and found that 52 of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36 of those who did volunteer experienced one . a study on adults ages 55 found that during the four - year study period , people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63 lower likelihood of dying . after controlling for prior health status , it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44 reduction in mortality . merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well - being . a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness . it is important to note that , while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness , it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder . the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional . studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break studies have also been careful to note that feeling over - taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness . additionally , while generous acts make people feel good about themselves , it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others . studies suggest that gratitude goes hand - in - hand with kindness and is also very important for our well - being . a study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that " a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals , positive affect , offering emotional support , sleep quality , and well - being " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme , and either harms the altruistic person , or well - intentioned actions cause more harm than good . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term " pathological altruism " was popularised by the book pathological altruism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break examples include depression and burnout seen in healthcare professionals , an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of ones own needs , hoarding of animals , and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society " ( " altruism , morality , and social solidarity " . american sociological association . . the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable , philanthropic , and other pro - social , altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field . the american sociology association ( asa ) acknowledges public sociology saying , " the intrinsic scientific , policy , and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct ' good societies ' is unquestionable " ( " altruism , morality , and social solidarity " asa ) . this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized , and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies . how altruism is framed , organized , carried out , and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and " build the good society " . the motivation of altruism is also the focus of study ; some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victims studies have shown that generosity in laboratory and in online experiments is contagious – people imitate observed generosity of others . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most , if not all , of the worlds religions promote altruism as a very important moral value . buddhism , christianity , hinduism , islam , jainism , judaism , and sikhism , etcetera , place particular emphasis on altruistic morality . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break altruism figures prominently in buddhism . love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism , and are focused on all beings equally : love is the wish that all beings be happy , and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering . " many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion . these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness , and the need for them lies at the very core of our being " ( dalai lama ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break still , the notion of altruism is modified in such a world - view , since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness : " the more we care for the happiness of others , the greater our own sense of well - being becomes " ( dalai lama ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment , buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative ( unhappy ) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment , but from the law of karma , which functions like a natural law of cause and effect . a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes : if one causes suffering , then as a natural consequence one would experience suffering ; if one causes happiness , then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism , not only for humans but for all sentient beings . jainism preaches the view of ahimsa – to live and let live , thereby not harming sentient beings , that is uncompromising reverence for all life . it also considers all living things to be equal . the first tirthankara , rishabhdev , introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings , from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation , giving oneself up for others , non - violence and compassion for all living things . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break jainism prescribes a path of non - violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal . a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors . ones unconquered mind with anger , pride ( ego ) , deceit , greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans . anger spoils good relations , pride destroys humility , deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything . jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness , pride by humility , deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation , one must practice the following ethical principles ( major vows ) in thought , speech and action . the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks . they are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the " great vows " ( mahavrata ) are prescribed for monks and " limited vows " ( anuvrata ) are prescribed for householders . the house - holders are encouraged to practice the above - mentioned five vows . the monks have to observe them very strictly . with consistent practice , it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually , accelerating the spiritual progress . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul . jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha ( god in jainism ) . because all living beings possess a soul , great care and awareness is essential in ones actions . jainism emphasizes the equality of all life , advocating harmlessness towards all , whether the creatures are great or small . this policy extends even to microscopic organisms jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the gospel , especially in the sermon on the mount and the sermon on the plain . from biblical to medieval christian traditions , tensions between self - affirmation and the interest of others have sometimes been discussed in selfless love , as in pauline phrase " love does not seek its own . " in her indoctrination and self - deception book , roderik hindery seeks to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors and genuine self - affirmation , by analyzing self - care in the creative individualization of the self , and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many . love confirms others in their freedom , avoids propaganda and masks , assures others of its presence , and is ultimately confirmed not by mere statements from others , but by the personal experience of each and every inner practice . as in the practical arts , the presence and meaning of love becomes valid and encompassed not only by words and reflections , but also by making the connection . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break st thomas aquinas interprets ' you should love your neighbour as yourself ' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others . considering that " the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship " and quotes aristotle that " the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves " , he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves , we naturally seek the common good , the good of the whole , more than any private good , the good of a part . however , he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours , and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude : a more desirable thing than bodily well - being . in coining the word altruism , as stated above , comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine , which is present in some theological schools within catholicism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god . 1 john 4 states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman , and that hatred of ones fellowman is the same as hatred of god . thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love . an altruistic action is not always a loving action . oord defines altruism as acting for the others good , and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for ones own good when the others demands undermine overall well - being . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak . one way is a sincere expression of christian love , " motivated by a powerful feeling of security , strength , and inner salvation , of the invincible fullness of ones own life and existence " . another way is merely " one of the many modern substitutes for love , nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other peoples business " . at its worst , scheler says , " love for the small , the poor , the weak , and the oppressed is really disguised hatred , repressed envy , an impulse to detract , etcetera , directed against the opposite phenomena : wealth , strength , power , largesse . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in islam , the concept " īthār " ( إيثار ) ( altruism ) is the notion of " preferring others to oneself " . for sufis , this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of ones own concerns , where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by allah ( that is god ) on the human body , considered to be property of allah alone . the importance of īthār lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good ; islam considers those practicing īthār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this is similar to the notion of chivalry , but unlike that european concept , in īthār attention is focused on everything in existence . a constant concern for allah results in a careful attitude towards people , animals , and other things in this world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation . the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity . this is defined as bestowal , or giving , which is the intention of altruism . this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god . kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence . rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto in particular focused on the ' purpose of creation ' and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag , in his writings about the future generation , focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework . ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation , and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism , love for one another . ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break altruism is essential to the sikh religion . the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love , affection , sacrifice , patience , harmony , truthfulness . the concept of seva , or selfless service to the community for its own sake , is an important concept in sikhism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the fifth guru , arjun dev , sacrificed his life to uphold " 22 carats of pure truth , the greatest gift to humanity " , the guru granth . the ninth guru , tegh bahadur , sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the late seventeenth century , guru gobind singh ( the tenth guru in sikhism ) , was at war with the mughal rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh , bhai kanhaiya , attended the troops of the enemy . he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield . some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy . sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh , and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield . " what were you doing , and why ? " asked the guru . " i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them " , replied bhai kanhaiya . the guru responded , " then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds . you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break under the tutelage of the guru , bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism , which is still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in hinduism selflessness ( atmatyag ) , love ( prema ) , kindness ( daya ) and forgiveness ( kshama ) are considered as the highest acts of humanity or " manushyattva " . giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a divine act or " punya " and hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or " paapa " and will led them to heaven or " swarga " in afterlife . altruism is also the central act of various hindu mythology and religious poems and songs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the founder of warkari samprdaya the great saint " dhnyaneshwar maharaj " ( 1275 -

lived , and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed . hence , karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to ones merit . furthermore , one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or punya , which gives fruit . since apurva is non - sentient , it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god . it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however the very well known and popular text , the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga ( achieving oneness with god through action ) " nishkam karma " or action without expectation / desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism . altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and is central to hindu morality . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans ' obligations or motivations to act altruistically . proponents of ethical altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically . the opposing view is ethical egoism , which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self - interest . both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism , which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their co - inhabitants . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a related concept in descriptive ethics is psychological egoism , the thesis that humans always act in their own self - interest and that true altruism is impossible . rational egoism is the view that rationality consists in acting in ones self -

*********** Article 16: Ayn Rand ***********

alice oconnor ( born alisa zinovyevna rosenbaum ; , . most sources transliterate her given name as either alisa or alissa . , 1905– march 6 , 1982 ) , better known by her pen name ayn rand , was a russian - born american writer and philosopher . she is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named objectivism . born and educated in russia , she moved to the united states in 1926 . after two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two broadway plays , she achieved fame with her 1943 novel , the fountainhead . in 1957 , rand published her best - known work , the novel atlas shrugged . afterward , until her death in 1982 , she turned to non - fiction to promote her philosophy , publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge ; she rejected faith and religion . she supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism . in politics , she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism , statism , and anarchism . instead , she supported laissez - faire capitalism , which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights , including private property rights . although rand opposed libertarianism , which she viewed as anarchism , she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the united states . in art , rand promoted romantic realism . she was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her , except for aristotle , thomas aquinas , and classical liberals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics . although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death , academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy because of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor . her writings have politically influenced some libertarians and conservatives . the objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas , both to the public and in academic settings . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rand was born alisa zinovyevna rosenbaum on february2 , 1905 , to a russian - jewish bourgeois family living in saint petersburg . she was the eldest of three daughters of zinovy zakharovich rosenbaum , a pharmacist , and anna borisovna . she was twelve when the october revolution and the rule of the bolsheviks under vladimir lenin disrupted the life the family had enjoyed previously . her fathers business was confiscated , and the family fled to the city of yevpatoria in crimea , which was initially under the control of the white army during the russian civil war . after graduating high school there in june 1921 , she returned with her family to petrograd ( as saint petersburg was then named ) , where they faced desperate conditions , occasionally nearly starving . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when russian universities were opened to women after the revolution , she was in the first group of women to enroll at petrograd state university . at 16 , she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy , majoring in history . along with many other bourgeois students , she was purged from the university shortly before graduating . after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists , many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate , which she did in october 1924 . she then studied for a year at the state technicum for screen arts in leningrad . for an assignment , rand wrote an essay about the polish actress pola negri , which became her first published work . by this time , she had decided her professional surname for writing would be rand , and she adopted the first name ayn ( pronounced ) . rand said ayn was adapted from a finnic name . some biographical sources question this , suggesting it may come from a nickname based on the hebrew word עין ( ayin , meaning ' eye ' ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in late 1925 , rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in chicago . she departed on january17 , 1926 , and arrived in new york city on february19 , 1926 . intent on staying in the united states to become a screenwriter , she lived for a few months with her relatives before leaving for hollywood , california . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in hollywood , a chance meeting with famed director cecil demille led to work as an extra in his film the king of kings and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter . while working on the king of kings , she met an aspiring young actor , frank oconnor ; the two married on april15 , 1929 . she became a permanent american resident in july 1929 and an american citizen on march3 , 1931 . so her legal married name became alice oconnor , but she did not use that name publicly or with friends . she made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the united states , but they were unable to obtain permission to emigrate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay red pawn to universal studios in 1932 , although it was never produced . her courtroom drama night of january16th , first staged in hollywood in 1934 , reopened successfully on broadway in 1935 . each night , a jury was selected from members of the audience ; based on its vote , one of two different endings would be performed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break her first published novel , the semi - autobiographical we the living , was published in 1936 . set in soviet russia , it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state . initial sales were slow , and the american publisher let it go out of print , although european editions continued to sell . she adapted the story as a stage play , but the broadway production was a failure and closed in less than a week . after the success of her later novels , rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rand started her next major novel , the fountainhead , in december 1935 , but took a break from it in 1937 to write her novella anthem . the novella presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word i has been forgotten and replaced with we . it was published in england in 1938 , but rand could not find an american publisher at that time . as with we the living , rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946 , which has sold over 3million copies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the 1940s , rand became politically active . she and her husband were full - time volunteers for republican wendell willkies 1940 presidential campaign . this work brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free - market capitalism . she became friends with journalist henry hazlitt , who introduced her to the austrian school economist ludwig von mises . despite philosophical differences with them , rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career , and they expressed admiration for her . mises once referred to her as " the most courageous man in america " , a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said " man " instead of " woman " . rand became friends with libertarian writer isabel paterson . rand questioned her about american history and politics long into the night during their many meetings , and gave paterson ideas for her only non - fiction book , the god of the machine . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands first major success as a writer came in 1943 with the fountainhead , a novel about an uncompromising young architect named howard roark and his struggle against what rand described as " second - handers " —those who attempt to live through others , placing others above themselves . twelve publishers rejected it before bobbs - merrill company accepted it at the insistence of editor archibald ogden , who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it . while completing the novel , rand was prescribed the amphetamine benzedrine to fight fatigue . the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel , but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks ' rest . her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the success of the fountainhead brought rand fame and financial security . in 1943 , she sold the film rights to warner bros . and returned to hollywood to write the screenplay . producer hal wallis hired her afterwards as a screenwriter and script - doctor . her work for him included the screenplays for love letters and you came along . her contract with wallis also allowed time for other projects , including a never - completed nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called the moral basis of individualism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while working in hollywood , rand became involved with the anti - communist motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals and wrote articles on the groups behalf . she also joined the anti - communist american writers association . in 1947 , during the second red scare , rand testified as a " friendly witness " before the united states house un - american activities committee that the 1944 film song of russia grossly misrepresented conditions in the soviet union , portraying life there as much better and happier than it was . she also wanted to criticize the lauded 1946 film the best years of our lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world , but was not allowed to do so . when asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations ' effectiveness , rand described the process as " futile " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after several delays , the film version of the fountainhead was released in 1949 . although it used rands screenplay with minimal alterations , she " disliked the movie from beginning to end " and complained about its editing , the acting and other elements . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following the publication of the fountainhead , rand received many letters from readers , some of whom the book had influenced profoundly . in 1951 , rand moved from los angeles to new york city , where she gathered a group of these admirers that included future chair of the federal reserve alan greenspan , a young psychology student named nathan blumenthal ( later nathaniel branden ) and his wife barbara , and barbaras cousin leonard peikoff . initially , the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with rand at her apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy . later , rand began allowing them to read the manuscript drafts of her new novel , atlas shrugged . in 1954 , her close relationship with nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair , with the knowledge of their spouses . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break published in 1957 , atlas shrugged was considered rands magnum opus . she described the novels theme as " the role of the mind in mans existence—and , as a corollary , the demonstration of a new moral philosophy : the morality of rational self - interest " . it advocates the core tenets of rands philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement . the plot involves a dystopian united states in which the most creative industrialists , scientists , and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy . the novels hero and leader of the strike , john galt , describes it as stopping " the motor of the world " by withdrawing the minds of the individuals contributing most to the nations wealth and achievements . the novel contains an exposition of objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by galt . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break despite many negative reviews , atlas shrugged became an international bestseller ; however , the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed rand . atlas shrugged was her last completed work of fiction , marking the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1958 , nathaniel branden established the nathaniel branden lectures , later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute ( nbi ) , to promote rands philosophy through public lectures . he and rand co - founded the objectivist newsletter ( later renamed the objectivist ) in 1962 to circulate articles about her ideas ; she later republished some of these articles in book form . rand was unimpressed by many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards , sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her . critics , including some former nbi students and branden himself , later described the culture of the nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand . some described the nbi or the objectivist movement as a cult or religion . rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics , from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair . some of her followers mimicked her preferences , wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers . however , some former nbi students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated , and the problem was concentrated among rands closest followers in new york . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break throughout the 1960s and 1970s , rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at colleges and universities . she began delivering annual lectures at the ford hall forum , responding to questions from the audience . during these appearances , she often took controversial stances on the political and social issues of the day . these included : supporting abortion rights , opposing the vietnam war and the military draft ( but condemning many draft dodgers as " bums " ) , supporting israel in the yom kippur war of 1973 against a coalition of arab nations as " civilized men fighting savages " , saying european colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by american indians , and calling homosexuality " immoral " and " disgusting " , while also advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it . she endorsed several republican candidates for president of the united states , most strongly barry goldwater in 1964 , whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for the objectivist newsletter . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1964 , nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott , whom he later married . nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand . when she learned of it in 1968 , though her romantic relationship with branden had already ended , rand ended her relationship with both brandens , and the nbi was closed . she published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other " irrational behavior in his private life " . in subsequent years , rand and several more of her closest associates parted company . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking . in 1976 , she retired from writing her newsletter and , after her initial objections , allowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in social security and medicare . during the late 1970s , her activities within the objectivist movement declined , especially after the death of her husband on november9 , 1979 . one of her final projects was work on a never - completed television adaptation of atlas shrugged . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on march6 , 1982 , rand died of heart failure at her home in new york city . at her funeral , a 6 ft floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket . in her will , rand named peikoff as her heir . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rand described her approach to literature as " romantic realism " . she wanted her fiction to present the world " as it could be and should be " , rather than as it was . this approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters . her fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic individualists , depicted as fit and attractive . her villains support duty and collectivist moral ideals . rand often describes them as unattractive , and some have names that suggest negative traits , such as wesley mouch in atlas shrugged . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rand considered plot a critical element of literature , and her stories typically have what biographer anne heller described as " tight , elaborate , fast - paced plotting " . romantic triangles are a common plot element in rands fiction ; in most of her novels and plays , the main female character is romantically involved with at least two different men . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in school rand read works by fyodor dostoevsky , victor hugo , edmond rostand , and friedrich schiller , who became her favorites . she considered them to be among the " top rank " of romantic writers because of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots . hugo was an important influence on her writing , especially her approach to plotting . in the introduction she wrote for an english - language edition of his novel ninety - three , rand called him " the greatest novelist in world literature " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although rand disliked most russian literature , her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the russian symbolists and other nineteenth - century russian writing , most notably the 1863 novel what is to be done ? by nikolay chernyshevsky . rands experience of the russian revolution and early communist russia influenced the portrayal of her villains . beyond we the living , which is set in russia , this influence can be seen in the ideas and rhetoric of ellsworth toohey in the fountainhead , and in the destruction of the economy in atlas shrugged . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies ; her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early hollywood movie scenarios . they often follow common film editing conventions , such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene followed by close - up details , and her descriptions of women characters often take a " male gaze " perspective . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rand called her philosophy " objectivism " , describing its essence as " the concept of man as a heroic being , with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life , with productive achievement as his noblest activity , and reason as his only absolute " . she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics , epistemology , ethics , political philosophy , and aesthetics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in metaphysics , rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism , including all forms of religion . rand believed in free will as a form of agent causation and rejected determinism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in epistemology , rand considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception , the validity of which she considered axiomatic , and reason , which she described as " the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses " . rand rejected all claims of non - perceptual knowledge , including instinct , ' ' intuition , ' ' revelation , ' or any form of ' just knowing . in her introduction to objectivist epistemology , rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic–synthetic dichotomy . she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in ethics , rand argued for rational and ethical egoism ( rational self - interest ) , as the guiding moral principle . she said the individual should " exist for his own sake , neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself " . rand referred to egoism as " the virtue of selfishness " in her book of that title . in it , she presented her solution to the is - ought problem by describing a meta - ethical theory that based morality in the needs of " mans survival qua man " . she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness , and held the initiation of force was evil and irrational , writing in atlas shrugged that , " force and mind are opposites " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands political philosophy emphasized individual rights , including property rights . she considered laissez - faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights . rand opposed collectivism and statism , which she understood to include many specific forms of government , such as communism , fascism , socialism , theocracy , and the welfare state . her preferred form of government was a constitutional republic that is limited to the protection of individual rights . although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian , rand preferred the term " radical for capitalism " . she worked with conservatives on political projects , but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics . rand denounced libertarianism , which she associated with anarchism . she rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in subjectivism that would lead to collectivism in practice . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in aesthetics , rand defined art as a " selective re - creation of reality according to an artists metaphysical value - judgments " . according to her , art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be grasped easily , thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness . as a writer , the art form rand focused on most closely was literature . she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy . numerous authors , including robert nozick and william oneill , in some of the earliest academic critiques of her ideas , said she failed in her attempt to solve the is–ought problem . critics have called her definitions of egoism and altruism biased and inconsistent with normal usage . critics from religious traditions oppose her atheism and her rejection of altruism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break multiple critics , including nozick , have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails . others , like libertarian philosopher michael huemer , have gone further , saying that her support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions . some critics , like roy childs , have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism , rather than limited government . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break commentators , including hazel barnes , albert ellis , and nathaniel branden , have criticized rands focus on the importance of reason . branden said this emphasis led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break except for aristotle , thomas aquinas and classical liberals , rand was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her . acknowledging aristotle as her greatest influence , rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend " three as " —aristotle , aquinas , and ayn rand . in a 1959 interview with mike wallace , when asked where her philosophy came from , she responded : " out of my own mind , with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle , the only philosopher who ever influenced me . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in an article for the claremont review of books , political scientist charles murray criticized her claim that her only " philosophical debt " was to aristotle . he asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche . rand found early inspiration from nietzsche , and scholars have found indications of this in rands private journals . in 1928 , she alluded to his idea of the " superman " in notes for an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer william edward hickman . there are other indications of nietzsches influence in passages from the first edition of we the living ( which rand later revised ) , and in her overall writing style . by the time she wrote the fountainhead , rand had turned against nietzsches ideas , and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rand considered her philosophical opposite to be immanuel kant , whom she referred to as " the most evil man in mankinds history " ; she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed self - interest . philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences . she was also critical of plato , and viewed his differences with aristotle on questions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands relationship with contemporary philosophers was mostly antagonistic . she was not an academic and did not participate in academic discourse . she was dismissive toward critics and wrote about ideas she disagreed with in a polemical manner without in - depth analysis . she was in turn viewed very negatively by many academic philosophers , who dismissed her as an unimportant figure who need not be given serious consideration . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first reviews rand received were for night of january 16th . reviews of the broadway production were largely positive , but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer . although rand believed that her novel we the living was not widely reviewed , over 200 publications published approximately 125 different reviews . overall , they were more positive than those she received for her later work . her novella anthem received little review attention , both for its first publication in england and for subsequent re - issues . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands first bestseller , the fountainhead , received far fewer reviews than we the living , and reviewers ' opinions were mixed . lorine pruettes positive review in the new york times , which called the author " a writer of great power " who wrote " brilliantly , beautifully and bitterly " , was one that rand greatly appreciated . there were other positive reviews , but rand dismissed most of them for either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications . some negative reviews said the novel was too long ; others called the characters unsympathetic and rands style " offensively pedestrian " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break atlas shrugged was widely reviewed , and many of the reviews were strongly negative . atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications , but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that " reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put - downs " , with reviews including comments that it was " written out of hate " and showed " remorseless hectoring and prolixity " . whittaker chambers wrote what was later called the novels most " notorious " review for the conservative magazine national review . he accused rand of supporting a godless system ( which he related to that of the soviets ) , claiming , " from almost any page of atlas shrugged , a voice can be heard commanding : ' to a gas chamber—go ! historian jennifer burns describes the review as a break between buckleys religious conservatism and non - religious libertarianism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels . the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book , for the new intellectual , was similar to that for atlas shrugged . philosopher sidney hook likened her certainty to " the way philosophy is written in the soviet union " , and author gore vidal called her viewpoint " nearly perfect in its immorality " . these reviews set the pattern for reaction to her ideas among liberal critics . her subsequent books got progressively less review attention . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with over 30million copies sold , rands books continue to be read widely . a survey conducted for the library of congress and the book - of - the - month club in 1991 asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives . rands atlas shrugged was the second most popular choice , after the bible . although rands influence has been greatest in the united states , there has been international interest in her work . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands contemporary admirers included fellow novelists , like ira levin , kay nolte smith and neil smith ; she has influenced later writers like erika holzer , terry goodkind , and comic book artist steve ditko . rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work . businessmen such as john allison of bbt and ed snider of comcast spectacor have funded the promotion of rands ideas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break television shows , movies , and video games have referred to rand and her works . throughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines , as well as book - length critiques by authors such as the psychologist albert ellis and trinity foundation president john robbins . rand or characters based on her figure prominently in novels by american authors , including mary gaitskill , matt ruff , kay nolte smith , and tobias wolff . nick gillespie , former editor - in - chief of reason , remarked that , " rands is a tortured immortality , one in which shes as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist . jibes at rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture . " two movies have been made about rands life . a 1997 documentary film , ayn rand : a sense of life , was nominated for the academy award for best documentary feature . the passion of ayn rand , a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name , won several awards . rands image also appears on a 1999 postage stamp illustrated by artist nick gaetano . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rands works , most commonly anthem or the fountainhead , are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading . since 2002 , the ayn rand institute has provided free copies of rands novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum . the institute had distributed 4million copies in the and canada by the end of 2020 . in 2017 , rand was added to the required reading list for the a level politics exam in the united kingdom . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although she rejected the labels " conservative " and " libertarian " , rand has had a continuing influence on right - wing politics and libertarianism . rand is often considered one of the three most important women ( along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson ) in the early development of modern american libertarianism . david nolan , one founder of the libertarian party , said that " without ayn rand , the libertarian movement would not exist " . in his history of that movement , journalist brian doherty described her as " the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large " . historian jennifer burns referred to her as " the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives ( often members of the republican party ) , despite rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative , like being pro - choice and an atheist . she faced intense opposition from william buckley jr . and other contributors to the conservative national review magazine , which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas . nevertheless , a 1987 article in the new york times referred to her as the reagan administrations " novelist laureate " . republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels . she has influenced some conservative politicians outside the , such as sajid javid in the united kingdom , siv jensen in norway , and ayelet shaked in israel . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the financial crisis of 2007–2008 spurred renewed interest in her works , especially atlas shrugged , which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis . opinion articles compared real - world events with the novels plot . signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests . there was increased criticism of her ideas , especially from the political left . critics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets , particularly through her influence on alan greenspan . in 2015 , adam weiner said that through greenspan , " rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the us economy " . lisa duggan said that rands novels had " incalculable impact " in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas . in 2021 , cass sunstein said rands ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the trump administration , which he attributed to the " enduring influence " of rands fiction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during rands lifetime , her work received little attention from academic scholars . since her death , interest in her work has increased gradually . in 2009 , historian jennifer burns identified " three overlapping waves " of scholarly interest in rand , including " an explosion of scholarship " since the year 2000 . however , as of that same year , few universities included rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area , with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study . from 2002 to 2012 , over 60 colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of bbt corporation that required teaching rands ideas or works ; in some cases , the grants were controversial or even rejected because of the requirement to teach about rand . in 2020 , media critic eric burns said that , " rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime " , but " nobody in the academe pays any attention to her , neither as an author nor a philosopher " . that same year , the editor of a collection of critical essays about rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held " a stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule " her work , but he believed more academic critics were engaging with her work in recent years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1967 , john hospers discussed rands ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook , an introduction to philosophical analysis . that same year , hazel barnes included a chapter critiquing objectivism in her book an existentialist ethics . when the first full - length academic book about rands philosophy appeared in 1971 , its author declared writing about rand " a treacherous undertaking " that could lead to " guilt by association " for taking her seriously . a few articles about rands ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982 , many of them in the personalist . one of these was " on the randian argument " by libertarian philosopher robert nozick , who criticized her meta - ethical arguments . other philosophers , writing in the same publication , argued that nozick misstated rands case . in an article responding to nozick , douglas den uyl and douglas rasmussen defended her positions , but described her style as " literary , hyperbolic and emotional " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the philosophic thought of ayn rand , a 1984 collection of essays about objectivism edited by den uyl and rasmussen , was the first academic book about rands ideas published after her death . in one essay , political writer jack wheeler wrote that despite " the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage " , rands ethics are " a most immense achievement , the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought " . in 1987 , the ayn rand society was founded as an affiliate of the american philosophical association . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a 1995 entry about rand in contemporary women philosophers , jenny heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed rand . she said that rands philosophy " is regularly omitted from academic philosophy . yet , throughout literary academia , ayn rand is considered a philosopher . " writing in the 1998 edition of the routledge encyclopedia of philosophy , political theorist chandran kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts . he said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of aristotles ethics , and her political theory " is of little interest " because it is marred by an " ill - thought out and unsystematic " effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism . the journal of ayn rand studies , a multidisciplinary , peer - reviewed academic journal devoted to the study of rand and her ideas , was established in 1999 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a 2010 essay for the cato institute , huemer argued very few people find rands ideas convincing , especially her ethics . he attributed the attention she receives to her being a " compelling writer " , especially as a novelist , noting that atlas shrugged outsells rands non - fiction works and the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism . in 2012 , the pennsylvania state university press agreed to take over publication of the journal of ayn rand studies , and the university of pittsburgh press launched an " ayn rand society philosophical studies " series based on the societys proceedings . the fall 2012 update to the entry about rand in the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy said that " only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously " . that same year , political scientist alan wolfe dismissed rand as a " nonperson " among academics , an attitude that writer ben murnane later described as " the traditional academic view " of rand . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited than the discussion of her philosophy . mimi reisel gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about rands novels when she began researching her in 1973 , and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s . since her death , scholars of english and american literature have continued largely to ignore her work , although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s . several academic book series about important authors cover rand and her works , as well as in popular study guides like cliffsnotes and sparknotes . in the literary encyclopedia entry for rand written in 2001 , john david lewis declared that " rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation . " in 2019 , duggan described rands fiction as popular and influential on many readers , despite being easy to criticize for " her cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots , her rigid moralizing , her middle - to lowbrow aesthetic preferences and philosophical strivings " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the closure of the nathaniel branden institute , the objectivist movement continued in other forms in the 1970s , peikoff began delivering courses on objectivism . in 1979 , peter schwartz started a newsletter called the intellectual activist , which rand endorsed . she also endorsed the objectivist forum , a bimonthly magazine founded by objectivist philosopher harry binswanger , which ran from 1980 to 1987 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1985 , peikoff worked with businessman ed snider to establish the ayn rand institute , a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rands ideas and works . in 1990 , after an ideological disagreement with peikoff , david kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies , now known as the atlas society . in 2001 , historian john mccaskey organized the anthem foundation for objectivist scholarship , which provides grants for scholarly work on objectivism in academia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break fiction and drama : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

jazāʾir ( الجزائر , " the islands " ) , a truncated form of the older jazāʾir banī mazghanna ( جزائر بني مزغنة , " islands of the mazghanna tribe " ) , employed by medieval geographers such as al - idrisi . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break around 1 - million - year - old stone artifacts from ain hanech ( algeria ) were considered to represent the oldest archaeological materials in north africa . stone artifacts and cut - marked bones that were excavated from two nearby deposits at ain boucherit are estimated to be 1 million years old , and even older stone artifacts to be as old as 2 million years . hence , the ain boucherit evidence shows that ancestral hominins inhabited the mediterranean fringe in northern africa much earlier than previously thought . the evidence strongly argues for early dispersal of stone tool manufacture and use from east africa or a possible multiple - origin scenario of stone technology in both east and north africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levalloisian and mousterian styles ( 43000 bc ) similar to those in the levant . algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques . tools of this era , starting about 30000 bc , are called aterian ( after the archaeological site of bir el ater , south of tebessa ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian ( located mainly in the oran region ) . this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between 15000 and 10000 bc . neolithic civilization ( animal domestication and agriculture ) developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as 11000 bc or as late as between 6000 and 2000 bc . this life , richly depicted in the tassili najjer paintings , predominated in algeria until the classical period . the mixture of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called berbers , who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from their principal center of power at carthage , the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african coast ; by 600 bc , a phoenician presence existed at tipasa , east of cherchell , hippo regius ( modern annaba ) and rusicade ( modern skikda ) . these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as carthaginian power grew , its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically . berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture , manufacturing , trade , and political organisation supported several states . trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew , but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by the early 4th century bc , berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army . in the revolt of the mercenaries , berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war . they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthages north african territory , and they minted coins bearing the name libyan , used in greek to describe natives of north africa . the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 146 bc the city of carthage was destroyed . as carthaginian power waned , the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew . by the 2nd century bc , several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged . two of them were established in numidia , behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage . west of numidia lay mauretania , which extended across the moulouya river in modern - day morocco to the atlantic ocean . the high point of berber civilisation , unequalled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later , was reached during the reign of masinissa in the 2nd century bc . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after masinissas death in 148 bc , the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times . masinissas line survived until 24 ad , when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans , who founded many colonies in the region . like the rest of north africa , algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire , exporting cereals and other agricultural products . saint augustine was the bishop of hippo regius ( modern -

coastal areas of algeria , the spanish decided to get bolder , and invaded more algerian cities . in 1510 , they led a series of sieges and attacks , taking over bejaia in a large siege , and leading a semi - successful siege against algiers . they also besieged tlemcen . in 1511 , they took control over cherchell and jijel , and attacked mostaganem where although they werent able to conquer the city , they were able to force a tribute on them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1516 , the ottoman privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa , who operated successfully under the hafsids , moved their base of operations to algiers . they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spaniards with help from the locals who saw them as liberators from the christians , but the brothers eventually assassinated the local noble salim al - tumi and took control over the city and the surrounding regions . when aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of tlemcen , hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers . the ottoman sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some 2000 janissaries . with the aid of this force and native algerians , hayreddin conquered the whole area between constantine and oran ( although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until 1792 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the next beylerbey was hayreddins son hasan , who assumed the position in 1544 . he was a kouloughli or of mixed origins , as his mother was an algerian mooresse . until 1587 beylerbeylik of algiers was governed by beylerbeys who served terms with no fixed limits . subsequently , with the institution of a regular administration , governors with the title of pasha ruled for three - year terms the pasha was assisted by an autonomous janissary unit , known in algeria as the ojaq who were led by an agha . discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid - 1600s because they were not paid regularly , and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha . as a result , the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break plague had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa . algiers lost between 30000 and 50000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21 , and had high fatalities in 1654–57 , 1665 , 1691 and 1740–42 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other non - islamic shipping in the western mediterranean sea . they also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives . according to robert davis , from the 16th to 19th century , pirates captured 1 million to 1 million europeans as slaves . they often made raids on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slave markets in north africa and other parts of the ottoman empire . in 1544 , for example , hayreddin barbarossa captured the island of ischia , taking 4000 prisoners , and enslaved some 9000 inhabitants of lipari , almost the entire population . in 1551 , the ottoman governor of algiers , turgut reis , enslaved the entire population of the maltese island of gozo . barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands . the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera . the introduction of broad - sail ships from the beginning of the 17th century allowed them to branch out into the atlantic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in july 1627 two pirate ships from algiers under the command of dutch pirate jan janszoon sailed as far as iceland , raiding and capturing slaves . two weeks earlier another pirate ship from salé in morocco had also raided in iceland . some of the slaves brought to algiers were later ransomed back to iceland , but some chose to stay in algeria . in 1629 , pirate ships from algeria raided the faroe islands . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1671 , the taifa of raises , or the company of corsair captains rebelled , killed the agha , and placed one of its own in power . the new leader received the title of dey . after 1689 , the right to select the dey passed to the divan , a council of some sixty nobles . it was at first dominated by the ojaq ; but by the 18th century , it had become the deys instrument . in 1710 , the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent , replacing the pasha in that role . although algiers remained nominally part of the ottoman empire , and often had wars with other ottoman subjects and territories such as the beylik of tunis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat . the dey was elected for a life term , but in the 159 years ( 1671–1830 ) that the system was in place , fourteen of the twenty - nine deys were assassinated . despite usurpation , military coups and occasional mob rule , the day - to - day operation of the deylikal government was remarkably orderly . although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains , it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside , where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest . autonomous tribal states were tolerated , and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the kabylia , although in 1730 the regency was able to take control over the kingdom of kuku in western kabylia . many cities in the northern parts of the algerian desert paid taxes to algiers or one of its beys , although they otherwise retained complete autonomy from central control , while the deeper parts of the sahara were completely independent from algiers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break barbary raids in the mediterranean continued to attack spanish merchant shipping , and as a result , the spanish navy bombarded algiers in 1783 and 1784 . for the attack in 1784 , the spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of algiers as naples , portugal and the knights of malta . over 20000 cannonballs were fired , much of the city and its fortifications were destroyed and most of the algerian fleet was sunk . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1792 , algiers took back oran and mers el kébir , the two last spanish strongholds in algeria . in the same year , they conquered the moroccan rif and oujda , which they then abandoned in 1795 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 19th century , algerian pirates forged affiliations with caribbean powers , paying a " licence tax " in exchange for safe harbour of their vessels . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break attacks by algerian pirates on american merchantmen resulted in the first and second barbary wars , which ended the attacks on ships . a year later , a combined anglo - dutch fleet , under the command of lord exmouth bombarded algiers to stop similar attacks on european fishermen . these efforts proved successful , although algerian piracy would continue until the french conquest in 1830 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break under the pretext of a slight to their consul , the french invaded and captured algiers in 1830 . historian ben kiernan wrote on the french conquest of algeria : " by 1875 , the french conquest was complete . the war had killed approximately 825000 indigenous algerians since 1830 . " french losses from 1831 to 1851 were 92329 dead in the hospital and only 3336 killed in action . the population of algeria , which stood at about 2 million in 1872 , reached nearly 11 million in 1960 . french policy was predicated on " civilising " the country . the slave trade and piracy in algeria ceased following the french conquest . on 17 september 1860 , napoleon iii declared " our first duty is to take care of the happiness of the three million arabs , whom the fate of arms has brought under our domination . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during this time , only kabylia resisted , the kabylians were not colonized until after the mokrani revolt in 1871 . emir abdelkader , algerian leader insurgent against french colonial rule , 1865 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 1848 until independence , france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and département of the nation . one of frances longest - held overseas territories , algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european immigrants , who became known as colons and later , as pied - noirs . between 1825 and 1847 , 50000 french people emigrated to algeria . these settlers benefited from the french governments confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples , and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land . many europeans settled in oran and algiers , and by the early 20th century they formed a majority of the population in both cities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the late 19th and early 20th century , the european share was almost a fifth of the population . the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france , and this included substantial educational investments especially after 1900 . the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency , but in contrast to the other colonised countries ' path in central asia and caucasus , algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively human - capital intensive agriculture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the second world war , algeria came under vichy control before being liberated by the allies in operation torch , which saw the first large - scale deployment of american troops in the north african campaign . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gradually , dissatisfaction among the muslim population , which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system , gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france . in may 1945 , the uprising against the occupying french forces was suppressed through what is now known as the sétif and guelma massacre . tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954 , when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began after the publication of the declaration of 1 november 1954 . historians have estimated that between 30000 and 150000 harkis and their dependants were killed by the front de libération nationale ( fln ) or by lynch mobs in algeria . the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war , and the french conducted severe reprisals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries . historians , like alistair horne and raymond aron , state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the 1million deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence . horne estimated algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around 700000 . the war uprooted more than 2million algerians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the war against french rule concluded in 1962 , when algeria gained complete independence following the march 1962 evian agreements and the july 1962 self - determination referendum . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the number of european pied - noirs who fled algeria totaled more than 900000 between 1962 and 1964 . the exodus to mainland france accelerated after the oran massacre of 1962 , in which hundreds of militants entered european sections of the city , and began attacking civilians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break algerias first president was the front de libération nationale ( fln ) leader ahmed ben bella . moroccos claim to portions of western algeria led to the sand war in 1963 . ben bella was overthrown in 1965 by houari boumédiène , his former ally and defence minister . under ben bella , the government had become increasingly socialist and authoritarian ; boumédienne continued this trend . but , he relied much more on the army for his support , and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role . he collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive . oil extraction facilities were nationalised . this was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international 1973 oil crisis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 1960s and 1970s under president houari boumediene , algeria pursued a program of industrialisation within a state - controlled socialist economy . boumedienes successor , chadli bendjedid , introduced some liberal economic reforms he promoted a policy of arabisation in algerian society and public life . teachers of arabic , brought in from other muslim countries , spread conventional islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to orthodox islam . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil , leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the 1980s oil glut . economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in algerian social unrest during the 1980s ; by the end of the decade , bendjedid introduced a multi - party system . political parties developed , such as the islamic salvation front ( fis ) , a broad coalition of muslim groups . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in december 1991 the islamic salvation front dominated the first of two rounds of legislative elections . fearing the election of an islamist government , the authorities intervened on 11 january 1992 , cancelling the elections . bendjedid resigned and a high council of state was installed to act as the presidency . it banned the fis , triggering a civil insurgency between the fronts armed wing , the armed islamic group , and the national armed forces , in which more than 100000 people are thought to have died . the islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of civilian massacres . at several points in the conflict , the situation in algeria became a point of international concern , most notably during the crisis surrounding air france flight 8969 , a hijacking perpetrated by the armed islamic group . the armed islamic group declared a ceasefire in october 1997 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break algeria held elections in 1999 , considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by president abdelaziz bouteflika . he worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a " civil concord " initiative , approved in a referendum , under which many political prisoners were pardoned , and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty , in force until 13 january 2000 . the ais disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly . the groupe salafiste pour la prédication et le combat ( gspc ) , a splinter group of the armed islamic group , continued a terrorist campaign against the government . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bouteflika was re - elected in the april 2004 presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation . the programme comprised economic , institutional , political and social reform to modernise the country , raise living standards , and tackle the causes of alienation . it also included a second amnesty initiative , the charter for peace and national reconciliation , which was approved in a referendum in september 2005 . it offered amnesty to most guerrillas and government security forces . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in november 2008 , the algerian constitution was amended following a vote in parliament , removing the two -

" in december 2016 , the euro - mediterranean human rights monitor issued a report regarding violation of media freedom in algeria . it clarified that the algerian government imposed restrictions on freedom of the press ; expression ; and right to peaceful demonstration , protest and assembly as well as intensified censorship of the media and websites . due to the fact that the journalists and activists criticise the ruling government , some media organisations ' licenses are cancelled . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break independent and autonomous trade unions face routine harassment from the government , with many leaders imprisoned and protests suppressed . in 2016 , a number of unions , many of which were involved in the 2010–2012 algerian protests , have been deregistered by the government . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break homosexuality is illegal in algeria . public homosexual behavior is punishable by up to two years in prison . despite this , about 26 of algerians think that homosexuality should be accepted , according to the survey conducted by the bbc news arabic -

independence development model . in recent years , the algerian government has halted the privatization of state - owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy . these restrictions are just starting to be lifted off recently although questions about algerias slowly - diversifying economy remain . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy . the governments efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages . the country is facing a number of short - term and medium - term problems , including the need to diversify the economy , strengthen political , economic and financial reforms , improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a wave of economic protests in february and march 2011 prompted the algerian government to offer more than 23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases . public spending has increased by 27 annually during the past 5 years . the 2010–14 public -

largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is the sixth - largest gas exporter . the energy information administration reported that in 2005 , algeria had 160 tcuft of proven natural - gas reserves . it also ranks 16th in oil reserves . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break non - hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5 . to cope with social demands , the authorities raised expenditure , especially on basic food support , employment creation , support for smes , and higher salaries . high hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices , though the trend in production volume is downwards . and 70 of budgetary receipts , or us71 billion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the algerian national oil company is sonatrach , which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in algeria . all foreign operators must work in partnership with sonatrach , which usually has majority ownership in production -

their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world , which only knows of ludlow as a retired film star . considered a misfit by galts other adherents , he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding galts perspective . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to barbara branden , who was closely associated with rand at the time the book was written , there were sections written describing danneskjölds adventures at sea , cut from the final published text . in a 1974 comment at a lecture , ayn rand admitted that danneskjölds name was a tribute to victor hugos novel , , wherein the hero becomes the first of the counts of danneskjöld . in the published book , danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others ( dagny taggart or hank rearden ) , except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the president of taggart transcontinental and the books most important antagonist . taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own . he relies on his sister , dagny taggart , to actually run the railroad , but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti - capitalist moral and political beliefs . in a sense , he is the antithesis of dagny . this contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life : the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends , and the horror that he will succeed at this . in the final chapters of the novel , he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the unsupportive wife of hank rearden , who dislikes his habits and ( secretly at first ) seeks to ruin rearden to prove her own value . lillian achieves this , when she passes information to james taggart about her husbands affair with his sister . this information is used to blackmail rearden to sign a gift certificate which delivers all the property rights of rearden metal to others . lillian thereafter uses james taggart for sexual satisfaction , until hank abandons her . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ferris is a biologist who works as " co - ordinator " at the state science institute . he uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement , and publishes a book entitled why do you think you think ? he clashes on several occasions with hank rearden , and twice attempts to blackmail rearden into giving up rearden metal . he is also one of the group of looters who tries to get rearden to agree to the steel unification plan . ferris hosts the demonstration of the project x weapon , and is the creator of the ferris persuader , a torture machine . when john galt is captured by the looters , ferris uses the device on galt , but it breaks down before extracting the information ferris wants from galt . ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a former professor at patrick henry university , and along with colleague hugh akston , mentor to francisco danconia , john galt and ragnar danneskjöld . he has since become a sell - out , one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval , to the detriment of the free . he works at the state science institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military , including a sound - based weapon known as project x ( xylophone ) . he is killed when cuffy meigs ( see below ) drunkenly overloads the circuits of project x , causing it to destroy itself and every structure and living thing in a 100 - mile radius . the character was , in part , modeled on robert oppenheimer , whom rand had interviewed for an earlier project , and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons . to his former student galt , stadler represents the epitome of human evil , as the " man who knew better " but chose not to act for the good . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom hank rearden reluctantly employs in washington , who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty . in return for betraying hank by helping broker the equalization of opportunity bill ( which , by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one , forces hank to divest most of his companies ) , he is given a senior position at the bureau of economic planning and national resources . later in the novel he becomes its top co - ordinator , a position that eventually becomes economic dictator of the country . mouchs mantra , whenever a problem arises from his prior policy , is to say , " i cant help it . i need wider powers .

*********** Article 21: Anthropology ***********

anthropology is the scientific study of humanity , concerned with human behavior , human biology , cultures , societies , and linguistics , in both the present and past , including past human species . social anthropology studies patterns of behaviour , while cultural anthropology is commonly used today . linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life . biological or physical anthropology studies the biological development of humans . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break archaeological anthropology , often termed as ' anthropology of the past ' , studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence . it is considered a branch of anthropology in north america and asia , while in europe archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines , such as history . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the abstract noun anthropology is first attested in reference to history . their new latin anthropologia derived from the combining forms of the greek words ánthrōpos ( ἄνθρωπος , " study " ) . ( its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle . it began to be used in english , possibly via french anthropologie , by the early 18th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1647 , the bartholins , founders of the university of copenhagen , defined lanthropologie as follows : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anthropology , that is to say the science that treats of man , is divided ordinarily and with reason into anatomy , which considers the body and the parts , and psychology , which speaks of the soul . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently , such as the use by étienne serres in 1839 to describe the natural history , or paleontology , of man , based on comparative anatomy , and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at the french national museum of natural history by jean louis armand de quatrefages de bréau . various short - lived organizations of anthropologists had already been formed . the société ethnologique de paris , the first to use the term ethnology , was formed in 1839 . its members were primarily anti - slavery activists . when slavery was abolished in france in 1848 , the société was abandoned . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break meanwhile , the ethnological society of new york , currently the american ethnological society , was founded on its model in 1842 , as well as the ethnological society of london in 1843 , a break - away group of the aborigines ' protection society . these anthropologists of the times were liberal , anti - slavery , and pro - human - rights activists . they maintained international connections . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century . theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy , linguistics , and ethnology , making feature - by - feature comparisons of their subject matters , were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals , languages , and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then . for them , the publication of charles darwins on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect . darwin himself arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in agronomy and in the wild . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s . there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences . paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the société de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies , the société danthropologie de paris , meeting for the first time in paris in 1859 . efngroupnas fletcher points out , the french society was by no means the first to include anthropology or parts of it as its topic . previous organizations used other names . the german anthropological association of st . petersburg , however , met first in 1861 , but due to the death of its founder never met again . his definition now became " the study of the human group , considered as a whole , in its details , and in relation to the rest of nature " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break broca , being what today would be called a neurosurgeon , had taken an interest in the pathology of speech . he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals , which appeared to reside in speech . he discovered the speech center of the human brain , today called brocas area after him . his interest was mainly in biological anthropology , but a german philosopher specializing in psychology , theodor waitz , took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his six - volume work , entitled die anthropologie der naturvölker , 1859–1864 . the title was soon translated as " the anthropology of primitive peoples " . the last two volumes were published posthumously . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break waitz defined anthropology as " the science of the nature of man " . following brocas lead , waitz points out that anthropology is a new field , which would gather material from other fields , but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy , physiology , and psychology to differentiate man from " the animals nearest to him " . he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical , gathered by experimentation . the history of civilization , as well as ethnology , are to be brought into the comparison . it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species , man , is a unity , and that " the same laws of thought are applicable to all men " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break waitz was influential among british ethnologists . in 1863 , the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london , which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology . it was the 2nd society dedicated to general anthropology in existence . representatives from the french société were present , though not broca . in his keynote address , printed in the first volume of its new publication , the anthropological review , hunt stressed the work of waitz , adopting his definitions as a standard . among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor , inventor of cultural anthropology , and his brother alfred tylor , a geologist . previously edward had referred to himself as an ethnologist ; subsequently , an anthropologist . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break similar organizations in other countries followed : the anthropological society of madrid ( 1865 ) , the american anthropological association in 1902 , the anthropological society of vienna ( 1870 ) , the italian society of anthropology and ethnology ( 1871 ) , and many others subsequently . the majority of these were evolutionists . one notable exception was the berlin society for anthropology , ethnology , and prehistory ( 1869 ) founded by rudolph virchow , known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists . not religious himself , he insisted that darwins conclusions lacked empirical foundation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the last three decades of the 19th century , a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred , most independent , most publishing their own journals , and all international in membership and association . the major theorists belonged to these organizations . they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning . by 1898 , 48 educational institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology . none of the 75 faculty members were under a department named anthropology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the worlds higher educational institutions , many thousands in number . anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more . practical anthropology , the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems , has arrived ; for example , the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene . the organization has reached a global level . for example , the world council of anthropological associations ( wcaa ) , " a network of national , regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology " , currently contains members from about three dozen nations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since the work of franz boas and bronisław malinowski in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on cross - cultural comparisons , long - term in - depth examination of context , and the importance they place on participant - observation or experiential immersion in the area of research . cultural anthropology , in particular , has emphasized cultural relativism , holism , and the use of findings to frame cultural critiques . this has been particularly prominent in the united states , from boas ' arguments against 19th - century racial ideology , through margaret meads advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation , to current criticisms of post - colonial oppression and promotion of multiculturalism . ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldwork . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in great britain and the commonwealth countries , the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate . in the united states , anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early 20th century : biological or physical anthropology ; social , cultural , or sociocultural anthropology ; and archaeological anthropology ; plus linguistic anthropology . these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology ( a term coined and defined by adam kollár in 1783 ) . it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european tradition . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities , social sciences and natural sciences . anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences , including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of homo sapiens , human physical traits , human behavior , the variations among different groups of humans , how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture , and from social sciences , including the organization of human social and cultural relations , institutions , social conflicts , etcetera early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity , such as by al - biruni of the islamic golden age . nderstanding other religions : al - birunis and gadamers " fusion of horizons " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by kemal ataman page 59 as such , anthropology has been central in the development of several new ( late 20th century ) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science , global studies , and various ethnic studies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to clifford geertz , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist and postmodern theories , as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies . during the 1970s and 1990s , there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the discipline . during this shift , enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology . in contrast , archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist . due to this difference in epistemology , the four sub - fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology . cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them , while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among individuals and groups . cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy , literature and the arts ( how ones culture affects the experience for self and group , contributing to a more complete understanding of the peoples knowledge , customs , and institutions ) , while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history . in that , it helps develop an understanding of social structures , typically of others and other populations ( such as minorities , subgroups , dissidents , etcetera ) . there is no hard - and - fast distinction between them , and these categories overlap to a considerable degree . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism , the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values . accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross - cultural comparison . this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography . ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research , that is an ethnographic monograph . as a methodology , ethnography is based upon long - term fieldwork within a community or other research site . participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology . ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures . the process of participant - observation can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic ( conceptual , vs . etic , or technical ) point of view . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of sociocultural anthropology , as kinship is a human universal . sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political organization , law and conflict resolution , patterns of consumption and exchange , material culture , technology , infrastructure , gender relations , ethnicity , childrearing and socialization , religion , myth , symbols , values , etiquette , worldview , sports , music , nutrition , recreation , games , food , festivals , and language ( which is also the object of study in linguistic anthropology ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural anthropology , including the industrialized ( and de - industrialized ) west . the standard cross - cultural sample ( sccs ) includes 186 such cultures . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and non - human primates in their biological , evolutionary , and demographic dimensions . it examines the biological and social factors that have affected the evolution of humans and other primates , and that generate , maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains . artifacts , faunal remains , and human altered landscapes are evidence of the cultural and material lives of past societies . archaeologists examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human behavior and cultural practices . ethnoarchaeology is a type of archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence left behind by past human groups , who are presumed to have lived in similar ways . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break linguistic anthropology ( not to be confused with anthropological linguistics ) seeks to understand the processes of human communications , verbal and non - verbal , variation in language across time and space , the social uses of language , and the relationship between language and culture . it is the branch of anthropology that brings linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems , linking the analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of sociocultural processes . linguistic anthropologists often draw on related fields including sociolinguistics , pragmatics , cognitive linguistics , semiotics , discourse analysis , and narrative analysis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ethnography is a method of analysing social or cultural interaction . it often involves participant observation though an ethnographer may also draw from texts written by participants of in social interactions . ethnography views first - hand experience and social context as important . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tim ingold distinguishes ethnography from anthropology arguing that anthropology tries to construct general theories of human experience , applicable in general and novel settings , while ethnography concerns itself with fidelity . he argues that the anthropologist must make his writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other theory , but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists and the fields inform one another . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the universality of ' art ' as a cultural phenomenon . several anthropologists have noted that the western categories of ' painting ' , ' sculpture ' , or ' literature ' , conceived as independent artistic activities , do not exist , or exist in a significantly different form , in most non - western contexts . to surmount this difficulty , anthropologists of art have focused on formal features in objects which , without exclusively being ' artistic ' , have certain evident ' aesthetic ' qualities . boas ' primitive art , claude lévi - strauss ' the way of the masks ( 1982 ) or geertzs ' art as cultural system ' ( 1983 ) are some examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of ' art ' into an anthropology of culturally specific ' aesthetics ' . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break media anthropology ( also known as the anthropology of media or mass media ) emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding producers , audiences , and other cultural and social aspects of mass media . the types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts of media production ( for example , ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers , journalists in the field , film production ) to contexts of media reception , following audiences in their everyday responses to media . other types include cyber anthropology , a relatively new area of internet research , as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media , such as development work , social movements , or health education . this is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts , where media such as radio , the press , new media , and television have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to the study of music ( broadly defined ) , that emphasize its cultural , social , material , cognitive , biological , and other dimensions or contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or any particular repertoire . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ethnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields , such as teaching , politics , cultural anthropology etcetera while the origins of ethnomusicology date back to the 18th and 19th centuries , it was formally introduced as " ethnomusicology " by dutch scholar jaap kunst around 1950 . later , the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of the periodical ethnomusicology and the society of ethnomusicology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break visual anthropology is concerned , in part , with the study and production of ethnographic photography , film and , since the mid - 1990s , new media . while the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film , visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation , including areas such as performance , museums , art , and the production and reception of mass media . visual representations from all cultures , such as sandpaintings , tattoos , sculptures and reliefs , cave paintings , scrimshaw , jewelry , hieroglyphics , paintings , and photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its widest historic , geographic and cultural scope . it has a complex relationship with the discipline of economics , of which it is highly critical . its origins as a sub - field of anthropology begin with the polish - british founder of anthropology , bronisław malinowski , and his french compatriot , marcel mauss , on the nature of gift - giving exchange ( or reciprocity ) as an alternative to market exchange . economic anthropology remains , for the most part , focused upon exchange . the school of thought derived from marx and known as political economy focuses on production , in contrast . economic anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated to by economists , and have now turned to examine corporations , banks , and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of anthropology , including , but not limited to , non - capitalist societies . political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture . three main areas of interest rapidly developed . the first of these areas was concerned with the " pre - capitalist " societies that were subject to evolutionary " tribal " stereotypes . sahlins work on hunter - gatherers as the " original affluent society " did much to dissipate that image . the second area was concerned with the vast majority of the worlds population at the time , the peasantry , many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in vietnam . the third area was on colonialism , imperialism , and the creation of the capitalist world - system . more recently , these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial ( and post - industrial ) capitalism around the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break applied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems it is a " complex of related , research - based , instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data , initiation of direct action , and / or the formulation of policy " . more simply , applied anthropology is the practical side of anthropological research ; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community . it is closely related to development anthropology ( distinct from the more critical anthropology of development ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anthropology of development tends to view development from a critical perspective . the kind of issues addressed and implications for the approach simply involve pondering why , if a key development goal is to alleviate poverty , is poverty increasing ? why is there such a gap between plans and outcomes ? why are those working in development so willing to disregard history and the lessons it might offer ? why is development so externally driven rather than having an internal basis ? in short , why does so much planned development fail ? uvmr_ev_paragraph_break kinship can refer both to the study of the patterns of social relationships in one or more human cultures , or it can refer to the patterns of social relationships themselves . over its history , anthropology has developed a number of related concepts and terms , such as " descent " , " descent groups " , " lineages " , " affines " , " cognates " , and even " fictive kinship " . broadly , kinship patterns may be considered to include people related both by descent ( ones social relations during development ) , and also relatives by marriage . within kinship you have two different families . people have their biological families and it is the people they share dna with . this is called consanguineal relations or " blood ties " http : / / content . nflibnet . c . n / data -

western traditions , whose perspectives and experiences can differ from those of white feminists of europe , america , and elsewhere . from the perspective of the western world , historically such ' peripheral ' perspectives have been ignored , observed only from an outsider perspective , and regarded as less - valid or less - important than knowledge from the western world . exploring and addressing that double bias against women from marginalized racial or ethnic groups is of particular interest in intersectional feminist anthropology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break feminist anthropologists have stated that their publications have contributed to anthropology , along the way correcting against the systemic biases beginning with the " patriarchal origins of anthropology ( and ( academia ) " and note that from 1891 to 1930 doctorates in anthropology went to males more than 85 , more than 81 were under 35 , and only 7 to anyone over 40 years old , thus reflecting an age gap in the pursuit of anthropology by first - wave feminists until later in life . this correction of systemic bias may include mainstream feminist theory , history , linguistics , archaeology , and anthropology . feminist anthropologists are often concerned with the construction of gender across societies . gender constructs are of particular interest when studying sexism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to st . clair drake , vera mae green was , until " well into the 1960s " , the only african - american female anthropologist who was also a caribbeanist . she studied ethnic and family relations in the caribbean as well as the united states , and thereby tried to improve the way black life , experiences , and culture were studied . however , zora neale hurston , although often primarily considered to be a literary author , was trained in anthropology by franz boas , and published tell my horse about her " anthropological observations " of voodoo in the caribbean ( 1938 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break feminist anthropology is inclusive of the anthropology of birth as a specialization , which is the anthropological study of pregnancy and childbirth within cultures and societies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies " human health and disease , health care systems , and biocultural adaptation " . it is believed that william caudell was the first to discover the field of medical anthropology . currently , research in medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of anthropology as a whole . it focuses on the following six basic fields : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology worldwide are violence and social suffering ( farmer , 1999 , 2003 ; beneduce , 2010 ) as well as other issues that involve physical and psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness . on the other hand , there are fields that intersect with medical anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical production , such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or ethnopsychiatry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the interplay between economic systems , nutritional status and food security , and how changes in the former affect the latter . if economic and environmental changes in a community affect access to food , food security , and dietary health , then this interplay between culture and biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends associated with globalization . nutritional status affects overall health status , work performance potential , and the overall potential for economic development ( either in terms of human development or traditional western models ) for any given group of people . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break psychological anthropology is an interdisciplinary subfield of anthropology that studies the interaction of cultural and mental processes . this subfield tends to focus on ways in which humans ' development and enculturation within a particular cultural group– with its own history , language , practices , and conceptual categories– shape processes of human cognition , emotion , perception , motivation , and mental health . it also examines how the understanding of cognition , emotion , motivation , and similar psychological processes inform or constrain our models of cultural and social processes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cognitive anthropology seeks to explain patterns of shared knowledge , cultural innovation , and transmission over time and space using the methods and theories of the cognitive sciences ( especially experimental psychology and evolutionary biology ) often through close collaboration with historians , ethnographers , archaeologists , linguists , musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and interpretation of cultural forms cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break transpersonal anthropology studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture . as with transpersonal psychology , the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness ( asc ) and transpersonal experience . however , the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross - cultural issues – for instance , the roles of myth , ritual , diet , and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break political anthropology concerns the structure of political systems , looked at from the basis of the structure of societies . political anthropology developed as a discipline concerned primarily with politics in stateless societies , a new development started from the 1960s , and is still unfolding : anthropologists started increasingly to study more " complex " social settings in which the presence of states , bureaucracies and markets entered both ethnographic accounts and analysis of local phenomena . the turn towards complex societies meant that political themes were taken up at two main levels . firstly , anthropologists continued to study political organization and political phenomena that lay outside the state - regulated sphere ( as in patron - client relations or tribal political organization ) . secondly , anthropologists slowly started to develop a disciplinary concern with states and their institutions ( and on the relationship between formal and informal political institutions ) . an anthropology of the state developed , and it is a most thriving field today . geertz ' comparative work on " negara " , the balinese state , is an early , famous example . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break legal anthropology or anthropology of law specializes in " the cross - cultural study of social ordering " . earlier legal anthropological research often focused more narrowly on conflict management , crime , sanctions , or formal regulation . more recent applications include issues such as human rights , legal pluralism , and political uprisings . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break public anthropology was created by robert borofsky , a professor at hawaii pacific university , to " demonstrate the ability of anthropology and anthropologists to effectively address problems beyond the discipline – illuminating larger social issues of our times as well as encouraging broad , public conversations about them with the explicit goal of fostering social change " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cyborg anthropology originated as a sub - focus group within the american anthropological associations annual meeting in 1993 . the sub - group was very closely related to sts and the society for the social studies of science . donna haraways 1985 cyborg manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term . cyborg anthropology studies humankind and its relations with the technological systems it has built , specifically modern technological systems that have reflexively shaped notions of what it means to be human beings . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break digital anthropology is the study of the relationship between humans and digital - era technology , and extends to various areas where anthropology and technology intersect . it is sometimes grouped with sociocultural anthropology , and sometimes considered part of material culture . the field is new , and thus has a variety of names with a variety of emphases . these include techno - anthropology , digital ethnography , cyberanthropology , and virtual anthropology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ecological anthropology is defined as the " study of cultural adaptations to environments " . the sub - field is also defined as , " the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment " . the focus of its research concerns " how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments , and how their environments change across space and time . the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology , and arguably at least the backdrop , if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today , is political ecology . many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture , politics and power , globalization , localized issues , century anthropology and more . the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for / against or creation of policy , and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land . often , the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly ( organizing , participation ) or indirectly ( articles , documentaries , books , ethnographies ) . such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break social sciences , like anthropology , can provide interdisciplinary approaches to the environment . professor kay milton , director of the anthropology research network in the school of history and anthropology , describes anthropology as distinctive , with its most distinguishing feature being its interest in non - industrial indigenous and traditional societies . anthropological theory is distinct because of the consistent presence of the concept of culture ; not an exclusive topic but a central position in the study and a deep concern with the human condition . milton describes three trends that are causing a fundamental shift in what characterizes anthropology : dissatisfaction with the cultural relativist perspective , reaction against cartesian dualisms which obstructs progress in theory ( nature culture divide ) , and finally an increased attention to globalization ( transcending the barriers or time / space ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break environmental discourse appears to be characterized by a high degree of globalization . ( the troubling problem is borrowing non indigenous practices and creating standards , concepts , philosophies and practices in western countries . anthropology and environmental discourse now have become a distinct position in anthropology as a discipline . knowledge about diversities in human culture can be important in addressing environmental problems - anthropology is now a study of human ecology . human activity is the most important agent in creating environmental change , a study commonly found in human ecology which can claim a central place in how environmental problems are examined and addressed . other ways anthropology contributes to environmental discourse is by being theorists and analysts , or by refinement of definitions to become more neutral / universal , etcetera in exploring environmentalism - the term typically refers to a concern that the environment should be protected , particularly from the harmful effects of human activities . environmentalism itself can be expressed in many ways . anthropologists can open the doors of environmentalism by looking beyond industrial society , understanding the opposition between industrial and non industrial relationships , knowing what ecosystem people and biosphere people are and are affected by , dependent and independent variables , " primitive " ecological wisdom , diverse environments , resource management , diverse cultural traditions , and knowing that environmentalism is a part of culture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ethnohistory is the study of ethnographic cultures and indigenous customs by examining historical records . it is also the study of the history of various ethnic groups that may or may not exist today . ethnohistory uses both historical and ethnographic data as its foundation . its historical methods and materials go beyond the standard use of documents and manuscripts . practitioners recognize the utility of such source material as maps , music , paintings , photography , folklore , oral tradition , site exploration , archaeological materials , museum collections , enduring customs , language , and place names . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the anthropology of religion involves the study of religious institutions in relation to other social institutions , and the comparison of religious beliefs and practices across cultures . modern anthropology assumes that there is complete continuity between magical thinking and religion , refngroupn " it seems to be one of the postulates of modern anthropology that there is complete continuity between magic and religion . ' 35 : ' , ' see , ' , ' for ' , ' instance , ' , ' rr ' , ' marett , ' , ' faith , ' , ' hope , ' , ' and ' , ' charity ' , ' in ' , ' primitive ' , ' religion , ' , ' the ' , ' gifford ' , ' lectures ' , ' ( macmillan , ' , ' 1932 ) , ' , ' lecture ' , ' ii , ' , ' pp . , ' 21 ' , ' ff . we have no empirical evidence at all that there ever was an age of magic that has been followed and superseded by an age of religion . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break urban anthropology is concerned with issues of urbanization , poverty , and neoliberalism . ulf hannerz quotes a 1960s remark that traditional anthropologists were " a notoriously agoraphobic lot , anti - urban by definition " . various social processes in the western world as well as in the " third world " ( the latter being the habitual focus of attention of anthropologists ) brought the attention of " specialists in ' other cultures ' " closer to their homes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anthrozoology ( also known as " human–animal studies " ) is the study of interaction between living things . it is an interdisciplinary field that overlaps with a number of other disciplines , including anthropology , ethology , medicine , psychology , veterinary medicine and zoology . a major focus of anthrozoologic research is the quantifying of the positive effects of human - animal relationships on either party and the study of their interactions . it includes scholars from a diverse range of fields , including anthropology , sociology , biology , and philosophy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break biocultural anthropology is the scientific exploration of the relationships between human biology and culture . physical anthropologists throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a racial perspective ; that is , from the assumption that typological human biological differences lead to cultural differences . after world war ii the emphasis began to shift toward an effort to explore the role culture plays in shaping human biology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break evolutionary anthropology is the interdisciplinary study of the evolution of human physiology and human behaviour and the relation between hominins and non - hominin primates . evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science , combining the human development with socioeconomic factors . evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans , past and present . it is based on a scientific approach , and brings together fields such as archaeology , behavioral ecology , psychology , primatology , and genetics . it is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field , drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience , past and present . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break forensic anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology and human osteology in a legal setting , most often in criminal cases where the victims remains are in the advanced stages of decomposition . a forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed , burned , mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable . the adjective " forensic " refers to the application of this subfield of science to a court of law . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break paleoanthropology combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology . it is the study of ancient humans , as found in fossil hominid evidence such as petrifacted bones and footprints . genetics and morphology of specimens are crucially important to this field . markers on specimens , such as enamel fractures and dental decay on teeth , can also give insight into the behaviour and diet of past populations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break contemporary anthropology is an established science with academic departments at most universities and colleges . the single largest organization of anthropologists is the american anthropological association ( aaa ) , which was founded in 1903 . its members are anthropologists from around the globe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1989 , a group of european and american scholars in the field of anthropology established the european association of social anthropologists ( easa ) which serves as a major professional organization for anthropologists working in europe . the easa seeks to advance the status of anthropology in europe and to increase visibility of marginalized anthropological traditions and thereby contribute to the project of a global anthropology or world anthropology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hundreds of other organizations exist in the various sub - fields of anthropology , sometimes divided up by nation or region , and many anthropologists work with collaborators in other disciplines , such as geology , physics , zoology , paleontology , anatomy , music theory , art history , sociology and so on , belonging to professional societies in those disciplines as well . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as the field has matured it has debated and arrived at ethical principles aimed at protecting both the subjects of anthropological research as well as the researchers themselves , and professional societies have generated codes of ethics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anthropologists , like other researchers ( especially historians and scientists engaged in field research ) , have over time assisted state policies and projects , especially colonialism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some commentators have contended : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as part of their quest for scientific objectivity , present - day anthropologists typically urge cultural relativism , which has an influence on all the sub - fields of anthropology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ethical commitments in anthropology include noticing and documenting genocide , infanticide , racism , sexism , mutilation ( including circumcision and subincision ) , and torture . topics like racism , slavery , and human sacrifice attract anthropological attention and theories ranging from nutritional deficiencies , to genes , to acculturation , to colonialism , have been proposed to explain their origins and continued recurrences . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to illustrate the depth of an anthropological approach , one can take just one of these topics , such as " racism " and find thousands of anthropological references , stretching across all the major and minor sub - fields . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anthropologists ' involvement with the government , in particular , has caused bitter controversy within the discipline . franz boas publicly objected to us participation in world war i , and after the war he published a brief expose and condemnation of the participation of several american archaeologists in espionage in mexico under their cover as scientists . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break but by the 1940s , many of boas ' anthropologist contemporaries were active in the allied war effort against the axis powers ( nazi germany , fascist italy , and imperial japan ) . many served in the armed forces , while others worked in intelligence ( for example , office of strategic services and the office of war information ) . at the same time , david prices work on american anthropology during the cold war provides detailed accounts of the pursuit and dismissal of several anthropologists from their jobs for communist sympathies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break attempts to accuse anthropologists of complicity with the cia and government intelligence activities during the vietnam war years have turned up surprisingly little . many anthropologists ( students and teachers ) were active in the antiwar movement . numerous resolutions condemning the war in all its aspects were passed overwhelmingly at the annual meetings of the american anthropological association ( aaa ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break professional anthropological bodies often object to the use of anthropology for the benefit of the state . their codes of ethics or statements may proscribe anthropologists from giving secret briefings . the association of social anthropologists of the uk and commonwealth ( asa ) has called certain scholarship ethically dangerous . the " principles of professional responsibility " issued by the american anthropological association and amended through november 1986 stated that " in relation with their own government and with host governments no secret research , no secret reports or debriefings of any kind should be agreed to or given . " the current " principles of professional responsibility " does not make explicit mention of ethics surrounding state interactions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anthropologists , along with other social scientists , are working with the us military as part of the us armys strategy in afghanistan . the christian science monitor reports that " counterinsurgency efforts focus on better grasping and meeting local needs " in afghanistan , under the human terrain system ( hts ) program ; in addition , hts teams are working with the us military in iraq . in 2009 , the american anthropological associations commission on the engagement of anthropology with the us security and intelligence communities released its final report concluding , in part , that , " when ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions , not subject to external review , where data collection occurs in the context of war , integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency , and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic factors of the hts concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology . in summary , while we stress that constructive engagement between anthropology and the military is possible , ceaussic suggests that the aaa emphasize the incompatibility of hts with disciplinary ethics and practice for job seekers and that it further recognize the problem of allowing hts to define the meaning of " anthropology " within dod . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before wwii british ' social anthropology ' and american ' cultural anthropology ' were still distinct traditions . after the war , enough british and american anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological approaches from one another that some began to speak of them collectively as ' sociocultural ' anthropology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological work . one of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to be highly empirical . the quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a particular place , problem or phenomenon in detail , using a variety of methods , over a more extensive period than normal in many parts of academia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 1990s and 2000s , calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture , of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins , and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard . these dynamic relationships , between what can be observed on the ground , as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology , whether cultural , biological , linguistic or archaeological . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation and in the possibility of human universals ( behaviors , ideas or concepts shared by virtually all human cultures ) . they use many different methods of study , but modern population genetics , participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists " into the field , " which means traveling to a community in its own setting , to do something called " fieldwork . " on the biological or physical side , human measurements , genetic samples , nutritional data may be gathered and published as articles or monographs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis , anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods and geographic regions . human time on earth is divided up into relevant cultural traditions based on material , such as the paleolithic and the neolithic , of particular use in archaeology . further cultural subdivisions according to tool types , such as olduwan or mousterian or levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists in understanding major trends in the human past . anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as well , since mapping cultures is central to both sciences . by making comparisons across cultural traditions ( time - based ) and cultural regions ( space - based ) , anthropologists have developed various kinds of comparative method , a central part of their science . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break because anthropology developed from so many different enterprises ( see history of anthropology ) , including but not limited to fossil - hunting , exploring , documentary film - making , paleontology , primatology , antiquity dealings and curatorship , philology , etymology , genetics , regional analysis , ethnology , history , philosophy , and religious studies , it is difficult to characterize the entire field in a brief article , although attempts to write histories of the entire field have been made . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some authors argue that anthropology originated and developed as the study of " other cultures " , both in terms of time ( past societies ) and space ( non - european / non - western societies ) . for example , the classic of urban anthropology , ulf hannerz in the introduction to his seminal exploring the city : inquiries toward an urban anthropology mentions that the " third world " had habitually received most of attention ; anthropologists who traditionally specialized in " other cultures " looked for them far away and started to look " across the tracks " only in late 1960s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break now there exist many works focusing on peoples and topics very close to the authors " home " . it is also argued that other fields of study , like history and sociology , on the contrary focus disproportionately on the west . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in france , the study of western societies has been traditionally left to sociologists , but this is increasingly changing , starting in the 1970s from scholars like isac chiva and journals like terrain ( " fieldwork " ) , and developing with the center founded by marc augé ( le centre danthropologie des mondes contemporains , the anthropological research center of contemporary societies ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since the 1980s it has become common for social and cultural anthropologists to set ethnographic research in the north atlantic region , frequently examining the connections between locations rather than limiting research to a single locale . there has also been a related shift toward broadening the focus beyond the daily life of ordinary people ; increasingly , research is set in settings such as scientific laboratories , social movements , governmental and nongovernmental organizations and businesses . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 22: Agricultural science ***********

agricultural science ( or agriscience for short ) is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact , natural , economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture . professionals of the agricultural science are called agricultural scientists or agriculturists . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 18th century , johann friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum ( hydrated calcium sulphate ) as a fertilizer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1843 , john lawes and joseph henry gilbert began a set of long - term field experiments at rothamsted research station in england , some of which are still running as of 2018 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the united states , a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the hatch act of 1887 , which used the term " agricultural science " . the hatch act was driven by farmers ' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer . the smith - hughes act of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots , but the scientific foundation had been built . after 1906 , public expenditures on agricultural research in the us exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break - uvmr_ev_paragraph_break intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and developing countries , often referred to as the green revolution , was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity , as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and pesticides . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature , the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture , industrial development , and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields . these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology , such as integrated pest management , waste treatment technologies , landscape architecture , genomics , and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food production as something essentially different from non - essential economic ' goods ' . in fact , the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break new technologies , such as biotechnology and computer science ( for data processing and storage ) , and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields , including genetic engineering , agrophysics , improved statistical analysis , and precision farming . balancing these , as above , are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human - nature interactions of traditional agriculture , including interaction of religion and agriculture , and the non - material components of agricultural production systems - - gt ; uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agriculture , agricultural science , and agronomy are often confused . however , they cover different concepts : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agricultural sciences include research and development on : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 23: Alchemy ***********

alchemy ( from arabic : al - kīmiyā ; from ancient greek : khumeía ) is an ancient branch of natural philosophy , a philosophical and protoscientific tradition that was historically practiced in china , india , the muslim world , and europe . in its western form , alchemy is first attested in a number of pseudepigraphical texts written in greco - roman egypt during the first few centuries ad . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alchemists attempted to purify , mature , and perfect certain materials . common aims were chrysopoeia , the transmutation of " base metals " ( for example , lead ) into " noble metals " ( particularly gold ) ; the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to result from the alchemical magnum opus ( " great work " ) . the concept of creating the philosophers ' stone was variously connected with all of these projects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break islamic and european alchemists developed a basic set of laboratory techniques , theories , and terms , some of which are still in use today . they did not abandon the ancient greek philosophical idea that everything is composed of four elements , and they tended to guard their work in secrecy , often making use of cyphers and cryptic symbolism . in europe , the 12th - century translations of medieval islamic works on science and the rediscovery of aristotelian philosophy gave birth to a flourishing tradition of latin alchemy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects , despite criticisms by scholars such as eric holmyard and marie - louise von franz that they should be understood as complementary . the former is pursued by historians of the physical sciences , who examine the subject in terms of early chemistry , medicine , and charlatanism , and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred . the latter interests historians of esotericism , psychologists , and some philosophers and spiritualists . the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word alchemy comes from old french alquemie , alkimie , used in medieval latin as . this name was itself brought from the arabic word al - kīmiyā ( الكيمياء or الخيمياء ) composed of two parts : the late greek term khēmeía ( χημεία ) , also spelled khumeia ( χυμεία ) and khēmía ( χημία ) - see below , and the arabic definite article al - ( الـ ) , meaning ' the ' . together this association can be interpreted as ' the process of transmutation by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form ' . several etymologies have been proposed for the greek term . the first was proposed by zosimos of panopolis ( 3rd–4th centuries ) , who derived it from the name of a book , the khemeu . hermanm diels argued in 1914 that it rather derived from χύμα , used to describe metallic objects formed by casting . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break others trace its roots to the egyptian name kēme ( hieroglyphic 𓆎𓅓𓏏𓊖 khmi ) , meaning ' black earth ' , which refers to the fertile and auriferous soil of the nile valley , as opposed to red desert sand . according to the egyptologist wallis budge , the arabic word al - kīmiyaʾ actually means " the egyptian science " , borrowing from the coptic word for " egypt " , kēme ( or its equivalent in the mediaeval bohairic dialect of coptic , khēme ) . this coptic word derives from demotic kmỉ , itself from ancient egyptian kmt . the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour " black " ( egypt was the " black land " , by contrast with the " red land " , the surrounding desert ) ; so this etymology could also explain the nickname " egyptian black arts " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents . these traditions ' general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and " genetic " relationships . one can distinguish at least three major strands , which appear to be mostly independent , at least in their earlier stages : chinese alchemy , centered in china ; indian alchemy , centered on the indian subcontinent ; and western alchemy , which occurred around the mediterranean and whose center has shifted over the millennia from greco - roman egypt to the islamic world , and finally medieval europe . chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the dharmic faiths . in contrast , western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various western religions . it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin , or to what extent they influenced each other . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt , where the city of alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge , and retained its pre - eminence through most of the greek and roman periods . following the work of andré - jean festugière , modern scholars see alchemical practice in the roman empire as originating from the egyptian goldsmiths art , greek philosophy and different religious traditions . tracing the origins of the alchemical art in egypt is complicated by the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the greek alchemical corpus . the treatises of zosimos of panopolis , the earliest historically attested author ( fl . c . 300 ce ) , can help in situating the other authors . zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors , such as mary the jewess , pseudo - democritus , and agathodaimon , but very little is known about any of these authors . the most complete of their works , the four books of pseudo - democritus , were probably written in the first century ad . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break recent scholarship tends to emphasize the testimony of zosimus , who traced the alchemical arts back to egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices . it has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way . zosimos of panopolis wrote in the final abstinence ( also known as the " final count " ) . zosimos explains that the ancient practice of " tinctures " ( the technical greek name for the alchemical arts ) had been taken over by certain " demons " who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices . since zosimos also called the demons " guardians of places " ( οἱ κατὰ τόπον ἔφοροι ) and those who offered them sacrifices " priests " ( ἱερέα ) , it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of egypt and their priests . while critical of the kind of alchemy he associated with the egyptian priests and their followers , zosimos nonetheless saw the traditions recent past as rooted in the rites of the egyptian temples . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mythology – zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to pharaonic egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class , though there is little to no evidence for his assertion . alchemical writers used classical figures from greek , roman , and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutation . these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets , isis , osiris , jason , and many others . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus ( or thrice - great hermes ) . his name is derived from the god thoth and his greek counterpart hermes . hermes and his caduceus or serpent - staff , were among alchemys principal symbols . according to clement of alexandria , he wrote what were called the " forty - two books of hermes " , covering all fields of knowledge . the hermetica of thrice - great hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice , called the hermetic philosophy by its early practitioners . these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break technology – the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy , extending back to 3500bc . many writings were lost when the roman emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria ( ad292 ) . few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived , most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus dating from ad250–300 , they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones , cleaning and fabricating pearls , and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver . these writings lack the mystical , philosophical elements of alchemy , but do contain the works of bolus of mendes ( or pseudo - democritus ) , which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elements . between the time of bolus and zosimos , the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a hermetic art . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break philosophy – alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism , platonism , stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemys character . the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter , not quantitative , as our modern elements are ; " true alchemy never regarded earth , air , water , and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the present - day sense of the word . the four elements are simply the primary , and most general , qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form . " later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alchemy coexisted alongside emerging christianity . lactantius believed hermes trismegistus had prophesied its birth . staugustine later affirmed this in the 4th 5th centuries , but also condemned trismegistus for idolatry . examples of pagan , christian , and jewish alchemists can be found during this period . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most of the greco - roman alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms , such as moses , isis , cleopatra , democritus , and ostanes . others authors such as komarios , and chymes , we only know through fragments of text . after ad400 , greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessors . by the middle of the 7th century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical discipline . it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world , facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the 8th and 9th centuries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break greek alchemy is preserved in medieval greek ( byzantine ) manuscripts , and yet historians have only relatively recently begun to pay attention to the study and development of greek alchemy in the byzantine period . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 2nd millennium bc text vedas describe a connection between eternal life and gold . text called arthashastra which provides ingredients of explosives ( agniyoga ) and salts extracted from fertile soils and plant remains ( yavakshara ) such as saltpetre / nitre , perfume making ( different qualities of perfumes are mentioned ) , granulated ( refined ) sugar . buddhist texts from the 2nd to 5th centuries mention the transmutation of base metals to gold . according to some scholars greek alchemy may have influenced indian alchemy but there are no hard evidences to back this claim . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 11th - century persian chemist and physician abū rayhān bīrūnī , who visited gujarat as part of the court of mahmud of ghazni , reported that they uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the goals of alchemy in india included the creation of a divine body ( sanskrit divya - deham ) and immortality while still embodied ( sanskrit jīvan - mukti ) . sanskrit alchemical texts include much material on the manipulation of mercury and sulphur , that are homologized with the semen of the god śiva and the menstrual blood of the goddess devī . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some early alchemical writings seem to have their origins in the kaula tantric schools associated to the teachings of the personality of matsyendranath . other early writings are found in the jaina medical treatise kalyāṇakārakam of ugrāditya , written in south india in the early 9th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break two famous early indian alchemical authors were nāgārjuna siddha and nityanātha siddha . nāgārjuna siddha was a buddhist monk . his book , rasendramangalam , is an example of indian alchemy and medicine . nityanātha siddha wrote rasaratnākara , also a highly influential work . in sanskrit , rasa translates to " mercury " , and nāgārjuna siddha was said to have developed a method of converting mercury into gold . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break scholarship on indian alchemy is in the publication of the alchemical body by david gordon white . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a modern bibliography on indian alchemical studies has been written by white . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the contents of 39 sanskrit alchemical treatises have been analysed in detail in jan meulenbelds history of indian medical literature . the discussion of these works in himl gives a summary of the contents of each work , their special features , and where possible the evidence concerning their dating . chapter 13 of himl , various works on rasaśāstra and ratnaśāstra ( or various works on alchemy and gems ) gives brief details of a further 655 ( six hundred and fifty - five ) treatises . in some cases meulenbeld gives notes on the contents and authorship of these works ; in other cases references are made only to the unpublished manuscripts of these titles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a great deal remains to be discovered about indian alchemical literature . the content of the sanskrit alchemical corpus has not yet ( 2014 ) been adequately integrated into the wider general history of alchemy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the fall of the roman empire , the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world . much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented : indeed , most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations . the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word al - kīmiyā ( الكيمياء ) . the early islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy . platonic and aristotelian thought , which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science , continued to be assimilated during the late 7th and early 8th centuries through syriac translations and scholarship . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the late ninth and early tenth centuries , the arabic works attributed to jābir ibn hayyān ( latinized as " geber " or " geberus " ) introduced a new approach to alchemy . paul kraus , who wrote the standard reference work on jabir , put it as follows : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the efforts of berthelot and ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results , and the later researchers , among them in particular mrs . hammer - jensen , tannery , lagercrantz , von lippmann , reitzenstein , ruska , bidez , festugière and others , could make clear only few points of detail . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the study of the greek alchemists is not very encouraging . an even surface examination of the greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory : even the supposedly technical writings , in the state where we find them today , are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is different with jabirs alchemy . the relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati , the methodical classification of the substances , mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the greek texts . the theory on which jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity . more than with the other arab authors , one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching , between the ilm and the amal . in vain one would seek in the greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented , for example , in the book of seventy . raus , paul , jâbir ibn hayyân , contribution à lhistoire des idées scientifiques dans lislam . i . le corpus des écrits jâbiriens . ii . jâbir et la science grecque , . cairo ( 1942–1943 ) . repr . by fuat sezgin , ( natural sciences in islam . 67–68 ) , frankfurt . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism . the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir . jabirs ultimate goal was takwin , the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory , up to , and including , human life . he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness , coldness , dryness , and moistness . by this reasoning , the search for the philosophers stone was introduced to western alchemy . jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substances name in arabic , when treated with various transformations , held correspondences to the elements physical properties . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir . his original system consisted of seven elements , which included the five classical elements ( aether , air , earth , fire , and water ) in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals : sulphur , " the stone which burns " , which characterized the principle of combustibility , and mercury , which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties . shortly thereafter , this evolved into eight elements , with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles : sulphur giving flammability or combustion , mercury giving volatility and stability , and salt giving solidity . the atomic theory of corpuscularianism , where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles , also has its origins in the work of jabir . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from the 9th to 14th centuries , alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists , including alkindus , abū al - rayhān al - bīrūnī , avicenna and ibn khaldun . in particular , they wrote refutations against the idea of the transmutation of metals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals , chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine . the philosophers stone of european alchemists can be compared to the grand elixir of immortality sought by chinese alchemists . in the hermetic view , these two goals were not unconnected , and the philosophers stone was often equated with the universal panacea ; therefore , the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists . as previously stated above , chinese alchemy was more related to medicine . it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life . described in 9th - century texts and used in fireworks in china by the 10th century , it was used in cannons by 1290 . from china , the use of gunpowder spread to japan , the mongols , the muslim world , and europe . gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in 1241 , and in europe by the 14th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine , such as acupuncture and moxibustion . in the early song dynasty , followers of this taoist idea ( chiefly the elite and upper class ) would ingest mercuric sulfide , which , though tolerable in low levels , led many to suicide . thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens , the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources ( the aforementioned tai chi chuan , mastering of the qi , etcetera ) chinese alchemy was introduced to the west by obed simon johnson . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to 11 february 1144 , with the completion of robert of chesters translation of the arabic book of the composition of alchemy . although european craftsmen and technicians pre - existed , robert notes in his preface that alchemy ( though here still referring to the elixir rather than to the art itself ) was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing . the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in 12th - century toledo , spain , through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath . translations of the time included the turba philosophorum , and the works of avicenna and muhammad ibn zakariya al - razi . these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent . alcohol , carboy , elixir , and athanor are examples . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break meanwhile , theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism , thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought . the 11th - century stanselm put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context . in the early 12th century , peter abelard followed anselms work , laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west . in the early 13th century , robert grosseteste used abelards methods of analysis and added the use of observation , experimentation , and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations . grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break through much of the 12th and 13th centuries , alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations , and new latin contributions were not made . the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists . in the 13th century , albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these , their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian terms albertus magnus , a dominican friar , is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time . albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna , where they concerned the transmutation of metals . from the time shortly after his death through to the 15th century , more than 28 alchemical tracts were misattributed to him , a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemist . likewise , alchemical texts have been attributed to alberts student thomas aquinas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break roger bacon , a franciscan friar who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics , comparative linguistics , and medicine , composed his great work for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time . while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic , he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemys connections to soteriology and christian theology . bacons writings integrated morality , salvation , alchemy , and the prolongation of life . his correspondence with clement highlighted this , noting the importance of alchemy to the papacy . like the greeks before him , bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres . he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle , the natural philosophers , and all latin writers of his time . the practical confirmed the theoretical , and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine . in later european legend , he became an archmage . in particular , along with albertus magnus , he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owners questions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break soon after bacon , the influential work of pseudo - geber ( sometimes identified as paul of taranto ) appeared . his summa perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods . it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside sulphur - mercury theory , and the unusual clarity with which they were described . by the end of the 13th century , alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief . adepts believed in the macrocosm - microcosm theories of hermes , that is to say , they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body ( for example , if one could learn the secret of purifying gold , one could use the technique to purify the human soul ) . they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above , and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated . finally , the alchemists practiced their art : they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theories about how the universe operated . their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that mans soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam . by purifying the two parts of mans soul , man could be reunited with god . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 14th century , alchemy became more accessible to europeans outside the confines of latin speaking churchmen and scholars . alchemical discourse shifted from scholarly philosophical debate to an exposed social commentary on the alchemists themselves . dante , piers plowman , and chaucer all painted unflattering pictures of alchemists as thieves and liars . pope john xxiis 1317 edict , spondent quas non - exhibent forbade the false promises of transmutation made by pseudo - alchemists . in 1403 , henry iv of england banned the practice of multiplying metals ( although it was possible to buy a licence to attempt to make gold alchemically , and a number were granted by henry vi and edward iv ) . these critiques and regulations centered more around pseudo - alchemical charlatanism than the actual study of alchemy , which continued with an increasingly christian tone . the 14th century saw the christian imagery of death and resurrection employed in the alchemical texts of petrus bonus , john of rupescissa , and in works written in the name of raymond lull and arnold of villanova . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nicolas flamel is a well - known alchemist , but a good example of pseudepigraphy , the practice of giving your works the name of someone else , usually more famous . although the historical flamel existed , the writings and legends assigned to him only appeared in 1612 . flamel was not a religious scholar as were many of his predecessors , and his entire interest in the subject revolved around the pursuit of the philosophers stone . his work spends a great deal of time describing the processes and reactions , but never actually gives the formula for carrying out the transmutations . most of ' his ' work was aimed at gathering alchemical knowledge that had existed before him , especially as regarded the philosophers stone . through the 14th and 15th centuries , alchemists were much like flamel : they concentrated on looking for the philosophers ' stone . bernard trevisan and george ripley made similar contributions . their cryptic allusions and symbolism led to wide variations in interpretation of the art . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the renaissance , hermetic and platonic foundations were restored to european alchemy . the dawn of medical , pharmaceutical , occult , and entrepreneurial branches of alchemy followed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the late 15th century , marsilio ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin . these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent . renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break esoteric systems developed that blended alchemy into a broader occult hermeticism , fusing it with magic , astrology , and christian cabala . a key figure in this development was german heinrich cornelius agrippa ( 1486–1535 ) , who received his hermetic education in italy in the schools of the humanists . in his de occulta philosophia , he attempted to merge kabbalah , hermeticism , and alchemy . he was instrumental in spreading this new blend of hermeticism outside the borders of italy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break philippus aureolus paracelsus , ( theophrastus bombastus von hohenheim , 1493–1541 ) cast alchemy into a new form , rejecting some of agrippas occultism and moving away from chrysopoeia . paracelsus pioneered the use of chemicals and minerals in medicine and wrote , " many have said of alchemy , that it is for the making of gold and silver . for me such is not the aim , but to consider only what virtue and power may lie in medicines . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break his hermetical views were that sickness and health in the body relied on the harmony of man the microcosm and nature the macrocosm . he took an approach different from those before him , using this analogy not in the manner of soul - purification but in the manner that humans must have certain balances of minerals in their bodies , and that certain illnesses of the body had chemical remedies that could cure them . iatrochemistry refers to the pharmaceutical applications of alchemy championed by paracelsus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break john dee ( 13 july 1527 – december , 1608 ) followed agrippas occult tradition . although better known for angel summoning , divination , and his role as astrologer , cryptographer , and consultant to queen elizabeth i , dees alchemical monas hieroglyphica , written in 1564 was his most popular and influential work . his writing portrayed alchemy as a sort of terrestrial astronomy in line with the hermetic axiom as above so below . during the 17th century , a short - lived " supernatural " interpretation of alchemy became popular , including support by fellows of the royal society : robert boyle and elias ashmole . proponents of the supernatural interpretation of alchemy believed that the philosophers stone might be used to summon and communicate with angels . journal of the history of ideas , 41 , 1980 , p . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of renaissance europe . alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining , medical services , and the production of chemicals , medicines , metals , and gemstones . rudolf ii , holy roman emperor , in the late 16th century , famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague , including dee and his associate edward kelley . king james iv of scotland , julius , duke of brunswick - lüneburg , henry v , duke of brunswick - lüneburg , augustus , elector of saxony , julius echter von mespelbrunn , and maurice , landgrave of hesse - kassel all contracted alchemists . johns son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although most of these appointments were legitimate , the trend of pseudo - alchemical fraud continued through the renaissance . betrüger would use sleight of hand , or claims of secret knowledge to make money or secure patronage . legitimate mystical and medical alchemists such as michael maier and heinrich khunrath wrote about fraudulent transmutations , distinguishing themselves from the con artists . false alchemists were sometimes prosecuted for fraud . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the terms " chemia " and " alchemia " were used as synonyms in the early modern period , and the differences between alchemy , chemistry and small - scale assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day . there were important overlaps between practitioners , and trying to classify them into alchemists , chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic . for example , tycho brahe ( 1546–1601 ) , an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations , had a laboratory built at his uraniborg observatory / research institute . michael sendivogius ( michał sędziwój , 1566–1636 ) , a polish alchemist , philosopher , medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around 1600 . sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who , in 1621 , applied this in a submarine . isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy ( see isaac newtons occult studies ) than he did to either optics or physics . other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle , and jan baptist van helmont . their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for " ancient wisdom " . although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the 17th century , alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years , and in fact may have reached its peak in the 18th century . as late as 1781 james price claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold . early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories , practices , and purposes : " scholastic and anti - aristotelian , paracelsian and anti - paracelsian , hermetic , neoplatonic , mechanistic , vitalistic , and more—plus virtually every combination and compromise thereof . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break robert boyle ( 1627–1691 ) pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations . he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data . boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out , the wind characteristics , the position of the sun and moon , and the barometer reading , all just in case they proved to be relevant . this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the 18th and 19th centuries , based on revolutionary discoveries and ideas of lavoisier and john dalton . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beginning around 1720 , a rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between " alchemy " and " chemistry " . by the 1740s , " alchemy " was now restricted to the realm of gold making , leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans , and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the occult revival of the early 19th century , alchemy received new attention as an occult science . the esoteric or occultist school , which arose during the 19th century , held ( and continues to hold ) the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense , and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience . this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination , as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals , and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual , moral or mystical processes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 19th - century revival of alchemy , the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan allen hitchcock , who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy . both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy , as atwood claimed : " no modern art or chemistry , notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims , has any thing in common with alchemy . " atwoods work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi , arthur edward waite , and rudolf steiner . hitchcock , in his remarks upon alchymists ( 1855 ) attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state . in 1845 , baron carl reichenbach , published his studies on odic force , a concept with some similarities to alchemy , but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1946 , louis cattiaux published the message retrouvé , a work that was at once philosophical , mystical and highly influenced by alchemy . in his lineage , many researchers , including emmanuel and charles dhooghvorst , are updating alchemical studies in france and belgium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several women appear in the earliest history of alchemy . michael maier names mary the jewess , cleopatra the alchemist , medera , and taphnutia as the four women who knew how to make the philosophers stone . zosimos ' sister theosebia ( later known as euthica the arab ) and isis the prophetess also played a role in early alchemical texts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first alchemist whose name we know was mary the jewess ( c . early sources claim that mary ( or maria ) devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry . essentially a double - boiler , it was ( and is ) used in chemistry for processes that require gentle heating . the tribikos ( a modified distillation apparatus ) and the kerotakis ( a more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations ) are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her . although we have no writing from mary herself , she is known from the early - fourth - century writings of zosimos of panopolis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to the proliferation of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works , it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women . after the greco - roman period , womens names appear less frequently in the alchemical literature . women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods , aside from the fictitious account of perenelle flamel . mary anne atwoods a suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery ( 1850 ) marks their return during the nineteenth - century occult revival . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the history of alchemy has become a significant and recognized subject of academic study . as the language of the alchemists is analyzed , historians are becoming more aware of the intellectual connections between that discipline and other facets of western cultural history , such as the evolution of science and philosophy , the sociology and psychology of the intellectual communities , kabbalism , spiritualism , rosicrucianism , and other mystic movements . institutions involved in this research include the chymistry of isaac newton project at indiana university , the university of exeter centre for the study of esotericism ( exeseso ) , the european society for the study of western esotericism ( esswe ) , and the university of amsterdams sub - department for the history of hermetic philosophy and related currents . a large collection of books on alchemy is kept in the bibliotheca philosophica hermetica in amsterdam . a recipe found in a mid - 19th - century kabbalah based book features step by step instructions on turning copper into gold . the author attributed this recipe to an ancient manuscript he located . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ' ambix ' , published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry , and ' isis ' , published by the history of science society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born . concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology . as such , the classical elements appear in alchemical writings , as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity . similarly , the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature . the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosophers stone . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the great work of alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature , and the 18th - century disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of chemistry , the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations . those focusing on the exoteric , such as historians of science lawrence principe and william newman , have interpreted the ' decknamen ' ( or code words ) of alchemy as physical substances . these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern texts . at the opposite end of the spectrum , focusing on the esoteric , scholars , such as florin george călian uvmr_ev_paragraph_break and anna marie roos , who question the reading of principe and newman , interpret these same decknamen as spiritual , religious , or psychological concepts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated , sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements . groups like the rosicrucians and freemasons have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism . since the victorian revival of alchemy , " occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice , involving the self - transformation of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances " , which has contributed to a merger of magic and alchemy in popular thought . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the eyes of a variety of modern esoteric and neo - hermeticist practitioners , alchemy is fundamentally spiritual . in this interpretation , transmutation of lead into gold is presented as an analogy for personal transmutation , purification , and perfection . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to this view , early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis ( c . ad 300 ) highlighted the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest , symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soul . this approach is held to have continued in the middle ages , as metaphysical aspects , substances , physical states , and material processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities , spiritual states , and , ultimately , transformation . in this sense , the literal meanings of ' alchemical formulas ' were like a veil , hiding their true spiritual philosophy . in the neo - hermeticist interpretation , both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect , diseased , corruptible , and ephemeral state toward a perfect , healthy , incorruptible , and everlasting state , so the philosophers stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible . applied to the alchemist himself , the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment , and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal . in texts that are held to have been written according to this view , the cryptic alchemical symbols , diagrams , and textual imagery of late alchemical works are supposed to contain multiple layers of meanings , allegories , and references to other equally cryptic works ; which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his 1766 alchemical catechism , théodore henri de tschudi denotes that the usage of the metals was merely symbolic : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a . by no means ; vulgar silver and gold are dead , while those of the philosophers are full of life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alchemical symbolism has been important in analytical psychology and was revived and popularized from near extinction by the swiss psychologist carl gustav jung . jung was initially confounded and at odds with alchemy and its images but after being given a copy of the secret of the golden flower , a chinese alchemical text translated by his friend richard wilhelm , he discovered a direct correlation or parallel between the symbolic images in the alchemical drawings and the inner , symbolic images coming up in the dreams , visions or imaginations of his patients . he observed these alchemical images occurring during the psychic process of transformation , a process that jung called " individuation . " specifically , he regarded the conjuring up of images of gold or lapis as symbolic expressions of the origin and goal of this " process of individuation . " and pored over them . the volumes of work he wrote brought new light into understanding the art of transubstantiation and renewed alchemys popularity as a symbolic process of coming into wholeness as a human being where opposites are brought into contact and inner and outer , spirit and matter are reunited in the hieros gamos or divine marriage . his writings are influential in general psychology but especially to those who have an interest in understanding the importance of dreams , symbols , and the unconscious archetypal forces ( archetypes ) that comprise all psychic life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break both von franz and jung have contributed significantly to the subject and work of alchemy and its continued presence in psychology as well as contemporary culture . among the volumes jung wrote on alchemy , his magnum opus is volume 14 of his collected works , mysterium coniunctionis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alchemy has had a long - standing relationship with art , seen both in alchemical texts and in mainstream entertainment . literary alchemy appears throughout the history of english literature from shakespeare to rowling , and also the popular japanese manga fullmetal alchemist . here , characters or plot structure follow an alchemical magnum opus . in the 14th century , chaucer began a trend of alchemical satire that can still be seen in recent fantasy works like those of the late sir terry pratchett . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break visual artists had a similar relationship with alchemy . while some of them used alchemy as a source of satire , others worked with the alchemists themselves or integrated alchemical thought or symbols in their work . music was also present in the works of alchemists and continues to influence popular performers . in the last hundred years , alchemists have been portrayed in a magical and spagyric role in fantasy fiction , film , television , novels , comics and video games . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one goal of alchemy , the transmutation of base substances into gold , is now known to be impossible by chemical means but possible by physical means . although not financially worthwhile , gold was synthesized in particle accelerators as early as 1941 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

*********** Article 25: Astronomer ***********

an astronomer is a scientist in the field of astronomy who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of earth . they observe astronomical objects such as stars , planets , moons , comets and galaxies – in either observational ( by analyzing the data ) or theoretical astronomy . examples of topics or fields astronomers study include planetary science , solar astronomy , the origin or evolution of stars , or the formation of galaxies . a related but distinct subject is physical cosmology , which studies the universe as a whole . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break astronomers usually fall under either of two main types : observational and theoretical . observational astronomers make direct observations of celestial objects and analyze the data . in contrast , theoretical astronomers create and investigate models of things that cannot be observed . because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle , astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form , evolve , and die . they use these data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break further subcategories under these two main branches of astronomy include planetary astronomy , galactic astronomy , or physical cosmology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break historically , astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky , while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using physical laws . today , that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms " astronomer " and " astrophysicist " are interchangeable . professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a phd in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities . they spend the majority of their time working on research , although they quite often have other duties such as teaching , building instruments , or aiding in the operation of an observatory . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the american astronomical society , which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america , has approximately 7000 members . this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics , geology , and engineering , whose research interests are closely related to astronomy . the international astronomical union comprises almost 10145 members from 70 countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night , it is far more common to use a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera to record a long , deep exposure , allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time . before ccds , photographic plates were a common method of observation . modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year . analysis of observed phenomena , along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe , takes the majority of observational astronomers ' time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes . most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths , sciences and computing in high school . taking courses that teach how to research , write , and present papers are also invaluable . in college / university most astronomers get a phd in astronomy or physics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers , the field is popular among amateurs . most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star parties . the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world , comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from 70 different nations . like any hobby , most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research . however , amateurs span the range from so - called " armchair astronomers " to the very ambitious , who own science - grade telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 26: ASCII ***********

ascii ( ) , abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange , is a character encoding standard for electronic communication . ascii codes represent text in computers , telecommunications equipment , and other devices . most modern character - encoding schemes are based on ascii , although they support many additional characters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the internet assigned numbers authority ( iana ) prefers the name us - ascii for this character encoding . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ascii is one of the ieee milestones . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ascii was developed from telegraph code . its first commercial use was as a seven - bit teleprinter code promoted by bell data services . work on the ascii standard began in may 1961 , with the first meeting of the american standards associations ( asa ) ( now the american national standards institute or ansi ) x3 subcommittee . the first edition of the standard was published in 1963 , underwent a major revision during 1967 , and experienced its most recent update during 1986 . compared to earlier telegraph codes , the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting ( that is , alphabetization ) of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the use of ascii format for network interchange was described in 1969 . that document was formally elevated to an internet standard in 2015 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break originally based on the english alphabet , ascii encodes 128 specified characters into seven - bit integers as shown by the ascii chart above . ninety - five of the encoded characters are printable : these include the digits 0 to 9 , lowercase letters a to z , uppercase letters a to z , and punctuation symbols . in addition , the original ascii specification included 33 non - printing control codes which originated with teletype machines ; most of these are now obsolete , although a few are still commonly used , such as the carriage return , line feed , and tab codes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for example , lowercase i would be represented in the ascii encoding by binary 1101001 hexadecimal 69 ( i is the ninth letter ) decimal 105 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the american standard code for information interchange ( ascii ) was developed under the auspices of a committee of the american standards association ( asa ) , called the x3 committee , by its x3 ( later x3l2 ) subcommittee , and later by that subcommittees x3 . working group ( now incits ) . the asa later became the united states of america standards institute ( usasi ) , and ultimately became the american national standards institute ( ansi ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the other special characters and control codes filled in , ascii was published as asa x3 - 1963 , leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning , reserved for future standardization , and one unassigned control code . and international organization for standardization tc 97 sc 2 voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standard . task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may 1963 meeting . locating the lowercase letters in sticks 6 and 7 caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit , which simplified case - insensitive character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the x3 committee made other changes , including other new characters ( the brace and vertical bar characters ) , renaming some control characters ( som became start of header ( soh ) ) and moving or removing others ( ru was removed ) . then usas x3 - 1968 , ansi x3 - 1977 , and finally , ansi x3 - 1986 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break revisions of the ascii standard : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the x3 standard , the x3 committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted ( least significant bit first ) , and how it should be recorded on perforated tape . they proposed a 9 - track standard for magnetic tape , and attempted to deal with some punched card formats . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the x3 subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems like other character encodings , ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character symbols ( that is graphemes and control characters ) . this allows digital devices to communicate with each other and to process , store , and communicate character - oriented information such as written language . before ascii was developed , the encodings in use included 26 alphabetic characters , 10 numerical digits , and from 11 to 25 special graphic symbols . to include all these , and control characters compatible with the comité consultatif international téléphonique et télégraphique ( ccitt ) international telegraph alphabet no . 2 ( ita2 ) standard of 1924 , fieldata ( 1956 ) , and early ebcdic ( 1963 ) , more than 64 codes were required for ascii . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ita2 was in turn based on the 5 - bit telegraph code that émile baudot invented in 1870 and patented in 1874 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the committee debated the possibility of a shift function ( like in ita2 ) , which would allow more than 64 codes to be represented by a six - bit code . in a shifted code , some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes . it allows compact encoding , but is less reliable for data transmission , as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable . the standards committee decided against shifting , and so ascii required at least a seven - bit code . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the committee considered an eight - bit code , since eight bits ( octets ) would allow two four - bit patterns to efficiently encode two digits with binary - coded decimal . however , it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice . the committee voted to use a seven - bit code to minimize costs associated with data transmission . since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position , it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together , for ease of identification . the first two so - called ascii sticks ( 32 positions ) were reserved for control characters . the " space " character had to come before graphics to make sorting easier , so it became position 20hex ; for the same reason , many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits . the committee decided it was important to support uppercase 64 - character alphabets , and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to a usable 64 - character set of graphic codes , as was done in the dec sixbit code ( 1963 ) . lowercase letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase . to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics , the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters , and the letter a was placed in position 41hex to match the draft of the corresponding british standard . the digits 0–9 are prefixed with 011 , but the remaining 4 bits correspond to their respective values in binary , making conversion with binary - coded decimal straightforward . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many of the non - alphanumeric characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on typewriters ; an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters , not electric typewriters . mechanical typewriters followed the de facto standard set by the remington no . 2 ( 1878 ) , the first typewriter with a shift key , and the shifted values of 23456789 - were " ' early typewriters omitted 0 and 1 , using o ( capital letter o ) and l ( lowercase letter l ) instead , but 1 ! and 0 ) pairs became standard once 0 and 1 became common . thus , in ascii ! " were placed in the second stick , positions 1–5 , corresponding to the digits 1–5 in the adjacent stick . the parentheses could not correspond to 9 and 0 , however , because the place corresponding to 0 was taken by the space character . this was accommodated by removing ( underscore ) from 6 and shifting the remaining characters , which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with 8 and 9 . this discrepancy from typewriters led to bit - paired keyboards , notably the teletype model 33 , which used the left - shifted layout corresponding to ascii , differently from traditional mechanical typewriters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break electric typewriters , notably the ibm selectric ( 1961 ) , used a somewhat different layout that has become de facto standard on computers following the ibm pc ( 1981 ) , especially model m ( 1984 ) and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did . pair also dates to the no . 2 , and the , lt ; . t ; pairs were used on some keyboards ( others , including the no . 2 , did not shift , ( comma ) or . ( full stop ) so they could be used in uppercase without unshifting ) . however , ascii split the ; : pair ( dating to no . 2 ) , and rearranged mathematical symbols ( varied conventions , commonly - ) to : ; - . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some then - common typewriter characters were not included , notably ½ ¼ ¢ , while were included as diacritics for international use , and lt ; gt ; for mathematical use , together with the simple line characters ( in addition to common / ) . the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented à in the french variation , so the was placed in position 40hex , right before the letter uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message ( som ) , end of address ( eoa ) , end of message ( eom ) , end of transmission ( eot ) , " who are you ? " ( wru ) , " are you ? " ( ru ) , a reserved device control ( dc0 ) , synchronous idle ( sync ) , and acknowledge ( ack ) . these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ascii - code order is also called asciibetical order . collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than " standard " alphabetical order ( collating sequence ) . the main deviations in ascii order are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ascii reserves the first 32 codes ( numbers 0–31 decimal ) for control characters : codes originally intended not to represent printable information , but rather to control devices ( such as printers ) that make use of ascii , or to provide meta - information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for example , character 10 represents the " line feed " function ( which causes a printer to advance its paper ) , and character 8 represents " backspace " . refers to control characters that do not include carriage return , line feed or white space as non - whitespace control characters . except for the control characters that prescribe elementary line - oriented formatting , ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document . other schemes , such as markup languages , address page and document layout and formatting . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character . the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional , for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream , and sometimes accidental , for example with the meaning of " delete " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break probably the most influential single device affecting the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model 33 asr , which was a printing terminal with an available paper tape reader / punch option . paper tape was a very popular medium for long - term program storage until the 1980s , less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape . in particular , the teletype model 33 machine assignments for codes 17 ( control - q , dc1 , also known as xon ) , 19 ( control - s , dc3 , also known as xoff ) , and 127 ( delete ) became de facto standards . the model 33 was also notable for taking the description of control - g ( code 7 , bel , meaning audibly alert the operator ) literally , as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character . because the keytop for the o key also showed a left - arrow symbol ( from ascii - 1963 , which had this character instead of underscore ) , a noncompliant use of code 15 ( control - o , shift in ) interpreted as " delete previous character " was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when a teletype 33 asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a control - s ( xoff , an abbreviation for transmit off ) , it caused the tape reader to stop ; receiving control - q ( xon , " transmit on " ) caused the tape reader to resume . this so - called flow control technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a " handshaking " signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending buffer overflow ; it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique . on some systems , control - s retains its meaning but control - q is replaced by a second control - s to resume output . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 33 asr also could be configured to employ control - r ( dc2 ) and control - t ( dc4 ) to start and stop the tape punch ; on some units equipped with this function , the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the teletype could not move its typehead backwards , so it did not have a key on its keyboard to send a bs ( backspace ) . instead , there was a key marked that sent code 127 ( del ) . the purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a manually - input paper tape : the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up , then type the rubout , which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored . teletypes were commonly used with the less - expensive computers from digital equipment corporation ; these systems had to use what keys were available , and thus the del code was assigned to erase the previous character . because of this , dec video terminals ( by default ) sent the del code for the key marked " backspace " while the separate key marked " delete " sent an escape sequence ; many other competing terminals sent a bs code for the backspace key . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the unix terminal driver could only use one code to erase the previous character , this could be set to bs or del , but not both , resulting in recurring situations of ambiguity where users had to decide depending on what terminal they were using ( shells that allow line editing , such as ksh , bash , and zsh , understand both ) . the assumption that no key sent a bs code allowed controlh to be used for other purposes , such as the " help " prefix command in gnu emacs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many more of the control codes have been assigned meanings quite different from their original ones . the " escape " character ( esc , code 27 ) , for example , was intended originally to allow sending of other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning , a so - called " escape sequence " . this is the same meaning of " escape " encountered in url encodings , c language strings , and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning . over time this interpretation has been co - opted and has eventually been changed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in modern usage , an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a so - called " ansi escape code " ( or , more properly , a " control sequence introducer " ) from ecma - 48 ( 1972 ) and its successors , beginning with esc followed by a " " ( left - bracket ) character . in contrast , an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an out - of - band character used to terminate an operation or special mode , as in the teco and vi text editors . in graphical user interface ( gui ) and windowing systems , esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit ( terminate ) altogether . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the inherent ambiguity of many control characters , combined with their historical usage , created problems when transferring " plain text " files between systems the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both " carriage return " ( which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line ) and " line feed " ( which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead ) . the name " carriage return " comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moves while the typebars that strike the ribbon remain stationary . the entire carriage had to be pushed ( returned ) to the left in order to position the paper for the next line . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break dec operating systems ( os / 8 , rt - 11 , rsx - 11 , rsts , tops - 10 , etcetera ) used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device ( originally teletype machines ) would work . by the time so - called " glass ttys " ( later called crts or " dumb terminals " ) came along , the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing to follow it . when gary kildall created cp / m , he was inspired by some of the command line interface conventions used in decs rt - 11 operating system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break until the introduction of pc dos in 1981 , ibm had no influence in this because their 1970s operating systems used ebcdic encoding instead of ascii , and they were oriented toward punch - card input and line printer output on which the concept of " carriage return " was meaningless . ibms pc dos ( also marketed as ms - dos by microsoft ) inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on cp / m , and windows in turn inherited it from ms - dos . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unfortunately , requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and ambiguity as to how to interpret each character when encountered by itself . to simplify matters , plain text data streams , including files , on multics used line feed ( lf ) alone as a line terminator . unix and unix - like systems , and amiga systems , adopted this convention from multics . on the other hand , the original macintosh os , apple dos , and prodos used carriage return ( cr ) alone as a line terminator ; however , since apple has now replaced these obsolete operating systems with the unix - based macos operating system , they now use line feed ( lf ) as well . the radio shack trs - 80 also used a lone cr to terminate lines . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as tops - 10 and tenex using cr - lf line endings ; machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings ; and machines running operating systems such as os / 360 that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and which used ebcdic rather than ascii encoding . the telnet protocol defined an ascii " network virtual terminal " ( nvt ) , so that connections between hosts with different line - ending conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network . telnet used ascii along with cr - lf line endings , and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt . the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol , including use of the network virtual terminal , for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode . this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols , and to other network protocols , such as those used for e - mail and the world wide web , on systems not using the nvts cr - lf line - ending convention . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the pdp - 6 monitor , for these reasons , eof , or end - of - file , was used colloquially and conventionally as a three - letter acronym for control - z instead of substitute . the end - of - text code ( etx ) , also known as control - c , was inappropriate for a variety of reasons , while using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to its position at the end of the alphabet , and serves as a very convenient mnemonic aid . a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream , usually from a keyboard . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in c library and unix conventions , the null character is used to terminate text strings ; such null - terminated strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz , where here z stands for " zero " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other representations might be used by specialist equipment , for example iso 2047 graphics or hexadecimal numbers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break codes 20hex to 7ehex , known as the printable characters , represent letters , digits , punctuation marks , and a few miscellaneous symbols . there are 95 printable characters in total . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break code 20hex , the " space " character , denotes the space between words , as produced by the space bar of a keyboard . since the space character is considered an invisible graphic ( rather than a control character ) it is listed in the table below instead of in the previous section . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break code 7fhex corresponds to the non - printable " delete " ( del ) control character and is therefore omitted from this chart ; it is covered in the previous sections chart . earlier versions of ascii used the up arrow instead of the caret ( 5ehex ) and the left arrow instead of the underscore ( 5fhex ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ascii was first used commercially during 1963 as a seven - bit teleprinter code for american telephone telegraphs twx ( teletypewriter exchange ) network . twx originally used the earlier five - bit ita2 , which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system . bob bemer introduced features such as the escape sequence . because of his extensive work on ascii , bemer has been called " the father of ascii " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on march 11 , 1968 , us president lyndon johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii , stating : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce 91 ; luther hodges93 ; regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july 1 , 1969 , must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december 2007 , when utf - 8 encoding surpassed it ; utf - 8 is backward compatible with ascii . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as computer technology spread throughout the world , different standards bodies and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of non - english languages that used roman - based alphabets . one could class some of these variations as " ascii extensions " , although some misuse that term to represent all variants , including those that do not preserve asciis character - map in the 7 - bit range . furthermore , the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from early in its development , ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break - itu - t itu 50 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break international reference alphabet ( ira ) uvmr_ev_paragraph_break international alphabet no . 5 ( ia5 ) - - gt ; uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso 646 ( 1967 ) that are identical or nearly identical to ascii , with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states , such as the symbol for the united kingdoms pound sterling ( £ ) ; for example with code page 1104 . almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii , since ascii suited the needs of only the us and a few other countries . for example , canada had its own version that supported french characters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many other countries developed variants of ascii to include non - english letters ( for example é , ñ , ß , ł ) , currency symbols ( for example £ , ¥ ) , etcetera see also yuscii ( yugoslavia ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it would share most characters in common , but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for " national use " . however , the four years that elapsed between the publication of ascii - 1963 and isos first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused asciis choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world , causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break iso / iec 646 , like ascii , is a 7 - bit character set . it does not make any additional codes available , so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries . escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text , but they were rarely used , so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and , therefore , which character a code represented , and in general , text - processing systems could cope with only one variant anyway . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to " national use " code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of iso / iec 646 , a german , french , or swedish , etcetera programmer using their national variant of iso / iec 646 , rather than ascii , had to write , and , thus , read , something such as uvmr_ev_paragraph_break instead of uvmr_ev_paragraph_break c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi c , although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use . many programmers kept their computers on us - ascii , so plain - text in swedish , german etcetera ( for example , in e - mail or usenet ) contained " , " and similar variants in the middle of words , something those programmers got used to . for example , a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch , could get " n jag har smrgsar " as the answer , which should be " nä jag har smörgåsar " meaning " no ive got sandwiches " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in japan and korea , still a variation of ascii is used , in which the backslash ( 5c hex ) is rendered as ¥ ( a yen sign , in japan ) or ₩ ( a won sign , in korea ) . this means that , for example , the file path c : userssmith is shown as c : ¥users¥smith ( in japan ) or c : ₩users₩smith ( in korea ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break eventually , as 8 - , 16 - , and 32 - bit ( and later 64 - bit ) computers began to replace 12 - , 18 - , and 36 - bit computers as the norm , it became common to use an 8 - bit byte to store each character in memory , providing an opportunity for extended , 8 - bit relatives of ascii . in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii , leaving the original character - mapping intact , but adding additional character definitions after the first 128 ( that is , 7 - bit ) characters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break encodings include iscii ( india ) , viscii ( vietnam ) . although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii , true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most early home computer systems developed their own 8 - bit character sets containing line - drawing and game glyphs , and often filled in some or all of the control characters from 0 to 31 with more graphics . kaypro cp / m computers used the " upper " 128 characters for the greek alphabet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the petscii code commodore international used for their 8 - bit systems is probably unique among post - 1970 codes in being based on ascii - 1963 , instead of the more common ascii - 1967 , such as found on the zx spectrum computer . atari 8 - bit computers and galaksija computers also used ascii variants . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ibm pc defined code page 437 , which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as smiley faces , and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper 128 positions . operating systems such as dos supported these code pages , and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware . digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set ( dec - mcs ) for use in the popular vt220 terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics . the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined a set , both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics , more like modern character sets . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the iso / iec 8859 standard ( derived from the dec - mcs ) finally provided a standard that most systems copied ( at least as accurately as they copied ascii , but with many substitutions ) . a popular further extension designed by microsoft , windows - 1252 ( often mislabeled as iso - 8859 - 1 ) , added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing . iso - 8859 - 1 , windows - 1252 , and the original 7 - bit ascii were the most common character encodings until 2008 when utf - 8 became more common . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break iso / iec 4873 introduced 32 additional control codes defined in the 80–9f hexadecimal range , as part of extending the 7 - bit ascii encoding to become an 8 - bit system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unicode and the iso / iec 10646 universal character set ( ucs ) have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant iso / iec 8859 and ascii rapidly in many environments . while ascii is limited to 128 characters , unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification ( using natural numbers called code points ) and encoding ( to 8 - , 16 - , or 32 - bit binary formats , called utf - 8 , utf - 16 , and utf - 32 , respectively ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ascii was incorporated into the unicode ( 1991 ) character set as the first 128 symbols , so the 7 - bit ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets . this allows utf - 8 to be backward compatible with 7 - bit ascii , as a utf - 8 file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters . even more importantly , forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only 7 - bit ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set ( as is often done to support 8 - bit ascii extensions such as iso - 8859 - 1 ) will preserve utf - 8 data unchanged . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break -

*********** Article 28: Animation ***********

animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images . in traditional animation , images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film . today , most animations are made with computer - generated imagery ( cgi ) . computer animation can be very detailed 3d animation , while 2d computer animation ( which may have the look of traditional animation ) can be used for stylistic reasons , low bandwidth , or faster real - time renderings . other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two - and three - dimensional objects like paper cutouts , puppets , or clay figures . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an animated cartoon is an animated film , usually a short film , featuring an exaggerated visual style . the style takes inspiration from comic strips , often featuring anthropomorphic animals , superheroes , or the adventures of human protagonists ( either children or adults ) . especially with animals that form a natural predator / prey relationship ( for example cats and mice , coyotes and birds ) , the action often centers around violent pratfalls such as falls , collisions , and explosions that would be lethal in real life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the illusion of animation—as in motion pictures in general—has traditionally been attributed to persistence of vision and later to the phi phenomenon and / or beta movement , but the exact neurological causes are still uncertain . the illusion of motion caused by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other , with unnoticeable interruptions , is a stroboscopic effect . while animators traditionally used to draw each part of the movements and changes of figures on transparent cels that could be moved over a separate background , computer animation is usually based on programming paths between key frames to maneuver digitally created figures throughout a digitally created environment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope , zoetrope , flip book , praxinoscope , and film . television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digitally . for display on computers , technology such as the animated gif and flash animation were developed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to short films , feature films , television series , animated gifs , and other media dedicated to the display of moving images , animation is also prevalent in video games , motion graphics , user interfaces , and visual effects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the physical movement of image parts through simple mechanics—for instance moving images in magic lantern shows—can also be considered animation . the mechanical manipulation of three - dimensional puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automata . electronic automata were popularized by disney as animatronics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word " animation " stems from the latin " animātiōn " , stem of " animātiō " , meaning " a bestowing of life " . the primary meaning of the english word is " liveliness " and has been in use much longer than the meaning of " moving image medium " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation , people all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry , automata , shadow play , and the magic lantern . the multi - media phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in european theatres from the late 18th century through the first half of the 19th century , featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1833 , the stroboscopic disc ( better known as the phénakisticope ) introduced the principle of modern animation with sequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures . series of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years , but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to represent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with a proper systematic breakdown of movements . the stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the zoetrope ( 1866 ) , the flip book ( 1868 ) and the praxinoscope ( 1877 ) . a typical 19th - century animation contained about 12 images that were displayed as a continuous loop by spinning a device manually . the flip book often contained more pictures and had a beginning and end , but its animation would not last longer than a few seconds . the first to create much longer sequences seems to have been charles - émile reynaud , who between 1892 and 1900 had much success with his 10 - to 15 - minute - long pantomimes lumineuses . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when cinematography eventually broke through in 1895 after animated pictures had been known for decades , the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment . animation on film was not commercialized until a few years later by manufacturers of optical toys , with chromolithography film loops ( often traced from live - action footage ) for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home . it would take some more years before animation reached movie theaters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after earlier experiments by movie pioneers stuart blackton , arthur melbourne - cooper , segundo de chomón , and edwin porter ( among others ) , blacktons the haunted hotel ( 1907 ) was the first huge stop motion success , baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail , without signs of any known stage trick . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break émile cohls fantasmagorie ( 1908 ) is the oldest known example of what became known as traditional ( hand - drawn ) animation . other great artistic and very influential short films were created by ladislas starevich with his puppet animations since 1910 and by winsor mccay with detailed drawn animation in films such as little nemo ( 1911 ) and gertie the dinosaur ( 1914 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the 1910s , the production of animated " cartoons " became an industry in the us . successful producer john randolph bray and animator earl hurd , patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century . felix the cat , who debuted in 1919 , became the first animated superstar . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1928 , steamboat willie , featuring mickey mouse and minnie mouse , popularized film with synchronized sound and put walt disneys studio at the forefront of the animation industry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the enormous success of mickey mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of american animation that would last until the 1960s . the united states dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of cel - animated theatrical shorts . several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have long - lasting careers , including walt disney productions ' goofy ( 1932 ) and donald duck ( 1934 ) , warner bros . cartoons ' looney tunes characters like porky pig ( 1935 ) , daffy duck ( 1937 ) , bugs bunny ( 1938–1940 ) , tweety ( 1941–1942 ) , sylvester the cat ( 1945 ) , wile coyote and road runner ( 1949 ) , fleischer studios / paramount cartoon studios ' betty boop ( 1930 ) , popeye ( 1933 ) , superman ( 1941 ) and casper ( 1945 ) , mgm cartoon studios tom and jerry ( 1940 ) and droopy , walter lantz productions / universal studio cartoons ' woody woodpecker ( 1940 ) , terrytoons / 20th century foxs gandy goose ( 1938 ) , dinky duck ( 1939 ) , mighty mouse ( 1942 ) and heckle and jeckle ( 1946 ) and united artists ' pink panther ( 1963 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1917 , italian - argentine director quirino cristiani made the first feature - length film el apóstol ( now lost ) , which became a critical and commercial success . it was followed by cristianis sin dejar rastros in 1918 , but one day after its premiere , the film was confiscated by the government . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after working on it for three years , lotte reiniger released the german feature - length silhouette animation die abenteuer des prinzen achmed in 1926 , the oldest extant animated feature . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1937 , walt disney studios premiered their first animated feature , snow white and the seven dwarfs , one of the highest - grossing traditional animation features . the fleischer studios followed this example in 1939 with gullivers travels with some success . partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the second world war , disneys next features pinocchio , fantasia ( both 1940 ) and fleischer studios ' second animated feature mr . bug goes to town ( 1941–1942 ) failed at the box office . for decades afterward , disney would be the only american studio to regularly produce animated features , until ralph bakshi became the first to also release more than a handful features . sullivan - bluth studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with an american tail in 1986 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although relatively few titles became as successful as disneys features , other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles , relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques . russias soyuzmultfilm animation studio , founded in 1936 , produced 20 films ( including shorts ) per year on average and reached 1582 titles in 2018 . china , czechoslovakia / czech republic , italy , france , and belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films , while japan became a true powerhouse of animation production , with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break animation became very popular on television since the 1950s , when television sets started to become common in most developed countries . cartoons were mainly programmed for children , on convenient time slots , and especially us youth spent many hours watching saturday - morning cartoons . many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the 1950s , the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to tv series . hanna - barbera productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series , such as the flintstones ( 1960–1966 ) ( the first prime time animated series ) , scooby - doo ( since 1969 ) and belgian co - production the smurfs ( 1981–1989 ) . the constraints of american television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts . quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late 1980s and in the early 1990s with hit series such as the simpsons ( since 1989 ) as part of a " renaissance " of american animation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while us animated series also spawned successes internationally , many other countries produced their own child - oriented programming , relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation . japanese anime tv series became very successful internationally since the 1960s , and european producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started co - productions with japanese studios , resulting in hit series such as barbapapa ( the netherlands / japan / france 1973–1977 ) , wickie und die starken männer / 小さなバイキング ビッケ ( vicky the viking ) ( austria / germany / japan 1974 ) , and the jungle book ( italy / japan 1989 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break computer animation was gradually developed since the 1940s . 3d wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the 1970s , with an early ( short ) appearance in the sci - fi thriller futureworld ( 1976 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the rescuers down under was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera . it was produced in a style thats very similar to traditional cel animation on the computer animation production system ( caps ) , developed by the walt disney company in collaboration with pixar in the late 1980s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the so - called 3d style , more often associated with computer animation , has become extremely popular since pixars toy story ( 1995 ) , the first computer - animated feature in this style . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the 1990s , as it proved cheaper and more profitable . not only the very popular 3d animation style was generated with computers , but also most of the films and series with a more traditional hand - crafted appearance , in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software , while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2010 , the animation market was estimated to be worth circa us80 billion . by 2020 , the value had increased to an estimated us270 billion . animated feature - length films returned the highest gross margins ( around 52 ) of all film genres between 2004 and 2013 . animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early 2020s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction , while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality . it has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during world war ii , animation was widely exploited for propaganda . many american studios , including warner bros . and disney , lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey to the public certain war values . some countries , including china , japan and the united kingdom , produced their first feature - length animation for their war efforts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break animation has been very popular in television commercials , both due to its graphic appeal , and the humour it can provide . some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades , such as snap , crackle and pop in advertisements for kelloggs cereals . the legendary animation director tex avery was the producer of the first raid " kills bugs dead " commercials in 1966 , which were very successful for the company . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apart from their success in movie theaters and television series , many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break animation has traditionally been very closely related to comic books . while many comic book characters found their way to the screen ( which is often the case in japan , where many manga are adapted into anime ) , original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines . somewhat similarly , characters and plots for video games ( an interactive animation medium ) have been derived from films and vice versa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media . stories and images can easily be adapted into childrens books and other printed media . songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media , the walt disney company is the best known and most extreme example . since first being licensed for a childrens writing tablet in 1929 , their mickey mouse mascot has been depicted on an enormous amount of products , as have many other disney characters . this may have influenced some pejorative use of mickeys name , but licensed disney products sell well , and the so - called disneyana has many avid collectors , and even a dedicated disneyana fanclub ( since 1984 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break disneyland opened in 1955 and features many attractions that were based on disneys cartoon characters . its enormous success spawned several other disney theme parks and resorts . disneys earnings from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception . with its popularity , a large amount of criticism has arisen , especially animated feature - length films many concerns of cultural representation , psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry , which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as with any other form of media , animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field . many are part of general or regional film award programs , like the chinas golden rooster award for best animation ( since 1981 ) . awards programs dedicated to animation , with many categories , include asifa - hollywoods annie awards , the emile awards in europe and the anima mundi awards in brazil . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apart from academy awards for best animated short film ( since 1932 ) and best animated feature ( since 2002 ) , animated movies have been nominated and rewarded in other categories , relatively often for best original song and best original score . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beauty and the beast was the first animated film nominated for best picture , in 1991 . up ( 2009 ) and toy story 3 ( 2010 ) also received best picture nominations , after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the creation of non - trivial animation works ( that is , longer than a few seconds ) has developed as a form of filmmaking , with certain unique aspects . traits common to both live - action and animated feature - length films are labor intensity and high production costs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase , the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than live - action films it is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a live - action film , but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators ( although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation ) . it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling five - minute scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film . thus , animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the 1930s of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards , then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole . while live - action films are now also storyboarded , they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards ( that is , real - time improvisation ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a films consistency from start to finish , even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger . animators , like all artists , necessarily have individual styles , but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film . since the early 1980s , teams of about 500 to 600 people , of whom 50 to 70 are animators , typically have created feature - length animated films it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their styles ; synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins . character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions , posed in different positions , and viewed from different angles . on traditionally animated projects , maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unlike live - action films , animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard format ; the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film . in the early 1960s , animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays ( while also continuing to use story departments ) and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late 1980s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break traditional animation ( also called cel animation or hand - drawn animation ) was the process used for most animated films of the 20th century . the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings , first drawn on paper . to create the illusion of movement , each drawing differs slightly from the one before it . the animators ' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels , which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings . the completed character cels are photographed one - by - one against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the 21st century . today , animators ' drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system . various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects . the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media , including traditional 35mm film and newer media with digital video . the " look " of traditional cel animation is still preserved , and the character animators ' work has remained essentially the same over the past 70 years . some animation producers have used the term " tradigital " ( a play on the words " traditional " and " digital " ) to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio ( united states , 1940 ) , animal farm ( united kingdom , 1954 ) , lucky and zorba ( italy , 1998 ) , and the illusionist ( british - french , 2010 ) . traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include the lion king ( us , 1994 ) , the prince of egypt ( us , 1998 ) , akira ( japan , 1988 ) , spirited away ( japan , 2001 ) , the triplets of belleville ( france , 2003 ) , and the secret of kells ( irish - french - belgian , 2009 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break full animation refers to the process of producing high - quality traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement , having a smooth animation . fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles , from more realistically animated works like those produced by the walt disney studio ( the little mermaid , beauty and the beast , aladdin , the lion king ) to the more ' cartoon ' styles of the warner bros . animation studio . many of the disney animated features are examples of full animation , as are non - disney works , the secret of nimh ( us , 1982 ) , the iron giant ( us , 1999 ) , and nocturna ( spain , 2007 ) . fully animated films are animated at 24 frames per second , with a combination of animation on ones and twos , meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of 24 or two frames out of 24 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or " skippy " movement animation . limited animation uses fewer drawings per second , thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation . this is a more economic technique . pioneered by the artists at the american studio united productions of america , limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression , as in gerald mcboing - boing ( us , 1951 ) , yellow submarine ( uk , 1968 ) , and certain anime produced in japan . its primary use , however , has been in producing cost - effective animated content for media for television ( the work of hanna - barbera , filmation , and other tv animation studios ) and later the internet ( web cartoons ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rotoscoping is a technique patented by max fleischer in 1917 where animators trace live - action movement , frame by frame . the source film can be directly copied from actors ' outlines into animated drawings , as in the lord of the rings ( us , 1978 ) , or used in a stylized and expressive manner , as in waking life ( us , 2001 ) and a scanner darkly ( us , 2006 ) . some other examples are fire and ice ( us , 1983 ) , heavy metal ( 1981 ) , and aku no hana ( japan , 2013 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break live - action / animation is a technique combining hand - drawn characters into live action shots or live - action actors into animated shots . one of the earlier uses was in koko the clown when koko was drawn over live - action footage . walt disney and ub iwerks created a series of alice comedies ( 1923–1927 ) , in which a live - action girl enters an animated world . other examples include allegro non troppo ( italy , 1976 ) , who framed roger rabbit ( us , 1988 ) , volere volare ( italy 1991 ) , space jam ( us , 1996 ) and osmosis jones ( us , 2001 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break stop - motion animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating real - world objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement . there are many different types of stop - motion animation , usually named after the medium used to create the animation . computer software is widely available to create this type of animation ; traditional stop - motion animation is usually less expensive but more time - consuming to produce than current computer animation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques , the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer . 2d animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while 3d techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact . 3d animation can create images that seem real to the viewer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 2d animation figures are created or edited on the computer using 2d bitmap graphics and 2d vector graphics . this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques , interpolated morphing , onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 2d animation has many applications , including analog computer animation , flash animation , and powerpoint animation . cinemagraphs are still photographs in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break final line advection animation is a technique used in 2d animation , to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department . speaking about using this approach in paperman , john kahrs said that " our animators can change things , actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want , and change the profile of the arm . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 3d animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator . the 3d model maker usually starts by creating a 3d polygon mesh for the animator to manipulate . a mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces , which give the visual appearance of form to a 3d object or 3d environment . sometimes , the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices . this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with key frames to create movement . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other techniques can be applied , mathematical functions ( for example , gravity , particle simulations ) , simulated fur or hair , and effects , fire and water simulations . these techniques fall under the category of 3d dynamics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 29: Apollo ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo , , ; , , ; , ; , , , , ; , is one of the olympian deities in classical greek and roman religion and greek and roman mythology . the national divinity of the greeks , apollo has been recognized as a god of archery , music and dance , truth and prophecy , healing and diseases , the sun and light , poetry , and more . one of the most important and complex of the greek gods , he is the son of zeus and leto , and the twin brother of artemis , goddess of the hunt . seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the kouros ( ephebe , or a beardless , athletic youth ) , apollo is considered to be the most greek of all the gods . apollo is known in greek - influenced etruscan mythology as apulu . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as the patron deity of delphi ( apollo pythios ) , apollo is an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the delphic oracle . apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil ; various epithets call him the " averter of evil " . delphic apollo is the patron of seafarers , foreigners and the protector of fugitives and refugees . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break medicine and healing are associated with apollo , whether through the god himself or mediated through his son asclepius . apollo delivered people from epidemics , yet he is also a god who could bring ill - health and deadly plague with his arrows . the invention of archery itself is credited to apollo and his sister artemis . apollo is usually described as carrying a golden bow and a quiver of silver arrows . apollos capacity to make youths grow is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona . as a protector of the young , apollo is concerned with the health and education of children . he presided over their passage into adulthood . long hair , which was the prerogative of boys , was cut at the coming of age and dedicated to apollo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo is an important pastoral deity , and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds . protection of herds , flocks and crops from diseases , pests and predators were his primary duties . on the other hand , apollo also encouraged founding new towns and establishment of civil constitution . he is associated with dominion over colonists . he was the giver of laws , and his oracles were consulted before setting laws in a city . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as the god of mousike , apollo presides over all music , songs , dance and poetry . he is the inventor of string - music , and the frequent companion of the muses , functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations . the lyre is a common attribute of apollo . in hellenistic times , especially during the 5th century bce , as apollo helios he became identified among greeks with helios , the personification of the sun . in latin texts , however , there was no conflation of apollo with sol among the classical latin poets until 1st century ce . apollo and helios / sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century ce . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo ( attic , ionic , and homeric greek : ἀπόλλων , ( ἀπόλλωνος ) ; doric : ἀπέλλων , ; arcadocypriot : ἀπείλων , ; aeolic : ἄπλουν , ; ) uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the name apollo—unlike the related older name paean—is generally not found in the linear b ( mycenean greek ) texts , although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form pe - rjo - ' ( linear ' , ' b : ' 𐀟𐁊 - ' on ' , ' the ' , ' kn ' , ' e ' , ' 842 ' , ' tablet , ' , ' though ' , ' it ' , ' has ' , ' also ' , ' been ' , ' suggested ' , ' that ' , ' the ' , ' name ' , ' might ' , ' actually ' , ' read ' , ' " hyperion " ' , ' ( u ' - pe - rjo - ne ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the etymology of the name is uncertain . the spelling ἀπόλλων ( in classical attic ) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era , but the doric form , ( ἀπέλλων ) , is more archaic , as it is derived from an earlier ἀπέλjων . it probably is a cognate to the doric month apellaios ( ἀπελλαῖος ) , and the offerings ( ἀπελλαῖα ) at the initiation of the young men during the family - festival ( ἀπέλλαι ) . according to some scholars , the words are derived from the doric word ( ἀπέλλα ) , which originally meant " wall , " " fence for animals " and later " assembly within the limits of the square . " apella ( ἀπέλλα ) is the name of the popular assembly in sparta , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several instances of popular etymology are attested from ancient authors . thus , the greeks most often associated apollos name with the greek verb ἀπόλλυμι , " to destroy " . plato in cratylus connects the name with ἀπόλυσις , " redemption " , with ἀπόλουσις ( apolousis ) , " purification " , and with ἁπλοῦν , " simple " , in particular in reference to the thessalian form of the name , ἄπλουν , and finally with ἀειβάλλων , " ever - shooting " . hesychius connects the name apollo with the doric ἀπέλλα , which means " assembly " , so that apollo would be the god of political life , and he also gives the explanation σηκός , " fold " , in which case apollo would be the god of flocks and herds . in the ancient macedonian language πέλλα means " stone , " and some toponyms may be derived from this word : πέλλα ( pella , the capital of ancient macedonia ) and πελλήνη ( pellēnē / pellene ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a number of non - greek etymologies have been suggested for the name , the hittite form apaliunas ( dx - ap - pa - li - u - na - aš ) is attested in the manapa - tarhunta letter . the hittite testimony reflects an early form apeljōn , which may also be surmised from comparison of cypriot ἀπείλων with doric ἀπέλλων . the name of the lydian god qλdãns / kʷʎðãns / may reflect an earlier / kʷalyán - / before palatalization , syncope , and the pre - lydian sound change y gt ; d . note the labiovelar in place of the labial / p / found in pre - doric ἀπέλjων and hittite apaliunas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a luwian etymology suggested for apaliunas makes apollo " the one of entrapment " , perhaps in the sense of " hunter " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollos chief epithet was phoebus ( ; φοῖβος , phoibos ) , literally " bright " . it was very commonly used by both the greeks and romans for apollos role as the god of light . like other greek deities , he had a number of others applied to him , reflecting the variety of roles , duties , and aspects ascribed to the god . however , while apollo has a great number of appellations in greek myth , only a few occur in latin literature . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollos birthplace was mount cynthus on the island of delos . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break delphi and actium were his primary places of worship . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo was worshipped throughout the roman empire . in the traditionally celtic lands , he was most often seen as a healing and sun god . he was often equated with celtic gods of similar character . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the cult centers of apollo in greece , delphi and delos , date from the 8th century bce . the delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to artemis , apollos twin sister . at delphi , apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent python . for the greeks , apollo was the most greek of all the gods , and through the centuries he acquired different functions . in archaic greece he was the prophet , the oracular god who in older times was connected with " healing " . in classical greece he was the god of light and of music , but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil . walter burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of apollo worship , which he termed " a dorian - northwest greek component , a cretan - minoan component , and a syro - hittite component . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in classical times , his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil , and he was therefore called " apotropaios " ( ἀποτρόπαιος , " averting evil " ) and " alexikakos " ( ἀλεξίκακος " keeping off ill " ; from v . ἀλέξω n . apollo also had many epithets relating to his function as a healer . some commonly - used examples are " paion " ( παιών literally " healer " or " helper " ) " epikourios " ( ἐπικούριος , " succouring " ) , " oulios " ( οὔλιος , " healer , baleful " ) and " loimios " ( λοίμιος , " of the plague " ) . in later writers , the word , " paion " , usually spelled " paean " , becomes a mere epithet of apollo in his capacity as a god of healing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo in his aspect of " healer " has a connection to the primitive god paean ( παιών - παιήων ) , who did not have a cult of his own . paean serves as the healer of the gods in the iliad , and seems to have originated in a pre - greek religion . it is suggested , though unconfirmed , that he is connected to the mycenaean figure pa - ja - wo - ne ( linear b : 𐀞𐀊𐀺𐀚 ) . paean was the personification of holy songs sung by " seer - doctors " ( ἰατρομάντεις ) , which were supposed to cure disease . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph . such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods : to dionysus , to apollo helios , to apollos son asclepius the healer . about the 4th century bce , the paean became merely a formula of adulation ; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered . it was in this way that apollo had become recognized as the god of music . apollos role as the slayer of the python led to his association with battle and victory ; hence it became the roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle , when a fleet left the harbour , and also after a victory had been won . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the iliad , apollo is the healer under the gods , but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows , similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudra . he sends a plague ( λοιμός ) to the achaeans . knowing that apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent , they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows , called a hecatomb . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the homeric hymn to apollo depicts apollo as an intruder from the north . the connection with the northern - dwelling dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month apellaios in northwest greek calendars . the family - festival was dedicated to apollo ( doric : ἀπέλλων ) . apellaios is the month of these rites , and apellon is the " megistos kouros " ( the great kouros ) . however it can explain only the doric type of the name , which is connected with the ancient macedonian word " pella " ( pella ) , stone . stones played an important part in the cult of the god , especially in the oracular shrine of delphi ( omphalos ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break george huxley regarded the identification of apollo with the minoan deity paiawon , worshipped in crete , to have originated at delphi . in the homeric hymn , apollo appeared as a dolphin and carried cretan priests to delphi , where they evidently transferred their religious practices . apollo delphinios or delphidios was a sea - god especially worshipped in crete and in the islands . apollos sister artemis , who was the greek goddess of hunting , is identified with britomartis ( diktynna ) , the minoan " mistress of the animals " . in her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the " master of the animals " , a bow - wielding god of hunting whose name has been lost ; aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular apollo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a non - greek origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break homer pictures apollo on the side of the trojans , fighting against the achaeans , during the trojan war . he is pictured as a terrible god , less trusted by the greeks than other gods . the god seems to be related to appaliunas , a tutelary god of wilusa ( troy ) in asia minor , but the word is not complete . the stones found in front of the gates of homeric troy were the symbols of apollo . a western anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of artimus ( artemis ) and qλdãns , whose name may be cognate with the hittite and doric forms , in surviving lydian texts . however , recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of qλdãns with apollo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the greeks gave to him the name ἀγυιεύς agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column . however , while usually greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon , all the feasts of apollo were celebrated at the seventh day of the month , and the emphasis given to that day ( sibutu ) indicates a babylonian origin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the late bronze age ( from 1700 to 1200 bce ) hittite and hurrian aplu was a god of plague , invoked during plague years . here we have an apotropaic situation , where a god originally bringing the plague was invoked to end it . aplu , meaning the son of , was a title given to the god nergal , who was linked to the babylonian god of the sun shamash . homer interprets apollo as a terrible god ( δεινὸς θεός ) who brings death and disease with his arrows , but who can also heal , possessing a magic art that separates him from the other greek gods . in iliad , his priest prays to apollo smintheus , the mouse god who retains an older agricultural function as the protector from field rats . all these functions , including the function of the healer - god paean , who seems to have mycenean origin , are fused in the cult of apollo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the vedic rudra has some similar functions with apollo . the terrible god is called " the archer " and the bow is also an attribute of shiva . rudra could bring diseases with his arrows , but he was able to free people of them and his alternative shiva is a healer physician god . however the indo - european component of apollo does not explain his strong relation with omens , exorcisms , and with the oracular cult . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unusually among the olympic deities , apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence : delos and delphi . in cult practice , delian apollo and pythian apollo ( the apollo of delphi ) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality . lycia was sacred to the god , for this apollo was also called lycian . apollos cult was already fully established when written sources commenced , about 650 bce . apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period , and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity . oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites . in the 2nd and 3rd century ce , those at didyma and claros pronounced the so - called " theological oracles " , in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all - encompassing , highest deity . " in the 3rd century , apollo fell silent . julian the apostate ( 359–361 ) tried to revive the delphic oracle , but failed . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo had a famous oracle in delphi , and other notable ones in claros and didyma . his oracular shrine in abae in phocis , where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus ( ἀπόλλων ἀβαῖος , apollon abaios ) , was important enough to be consulted by croesus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break his oracular shrines include : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break oracles were also given by sons of apollo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many temples were dedicated to apollo in greece and the greek colonies . they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of the greek architecture , which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations . some of the earliest temples , especially in crete , do not belong to any greek order . it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures . the different wooden elements were considered divine , and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order . the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances . the temples should be canonic , and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection . from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings . the first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof , and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras , who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century bc but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs , which couldnt be solved without changing the original forms the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order , but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple . both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the most important temples are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo appears often in the myths , plays and hymns . as zeus ' favorite son , apollo had direct access to the mind of zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans . a divinity beyond human comprehension , he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo was the son of zeus , the king of the gods , and leto , his previous wife or one of his mistresses . growing up , apollo was nursed by the nymphs korythalia and aletheia , the personification of truth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when zeus ' wife hera discovered that leto was pregnant , she banned leto from giving birth on terra firma . leto sought shelter in many lands , only to be rejected by them . finally , the voice of unborn apollo informed his mother about a floating island named delos that had once been asteria , letos own sister . since it was neither a mainland nor an island , leto was readily welcomed there and gave birth to her children under a palm tree . all the goddesses except hera were present to witness the event . it is also stated that hera kidnapped eileithyia , the goddess of childbirth , to prevent leto from going into labor . the other gods tricked hera into letting her go by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards ( 8 m ) long . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when apollo was born , clutching a golden sword , everything on delos turned into gold swans circled the island seven times and the nymphs sang in delight . zeus , who had calmed hera by then , came and adorned his son with a golden headband . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollos birth fixed the floating delos to the earth . this island became sacred to apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo was born on the seventh day ( ἑβδομαγενής , hebdomagenes ) of the month thargelion—according to delian tradition—or of the month bysios—according to delphian tradition . the seventh and twentieth , the days of the new and full moon , were ever afterwards held sacred to him . mythographers agree that artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of apollo or was born on the island of ortygia then helped leto cross the sea to delos the next day to give birth to apollo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hyperborea , the mystical land of eternal spring , venerated apollo above all the gods . the hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted pythian games . there , a vast forest of beautiful trees was called " the garden of apollo " . apollo spent the winter months among the hyperboreans . he returned to the world during the beginning of the spring . the theophania festival was held in delphi to celebrate his return . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is said that leto came to delos from hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves . henceforth , hyperborea became apollos winter home and wolves became sacred to him . his intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet lyceus , meaning wolf - like . but apollo was also the wolf - slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators . the hyperborean worship of apollo bears the strongest marks of apollo being worshipped as the sun god . shamanistic elements in apollos cult are often liked to his hyperborean origin , and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman . shamans like abaris and aristeas were also the followers of apollo , who hailed from hyperborea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in myths , the tears of amber apollo shed when his son asclepius died became the waters of the river eridanos , which surrounded hyperborea . apollo also buried in hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the cyclopes . he later gave this arrow to abaris . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a child , apollo is said to have built a foundation and an altar on delos using the horns of the goats that his sister artemis hunted . since he learnt the art of building when young , he later came to be known as archegetes , the founder ( of towns ) and god who guided men to build new cities . from his father zeus , apollo had also received a golden chariot drawn by swans . imothy bridgman uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hyperboreans : myth and history in celtic - hellenic contacts uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his early years when apollo spent his time herding cows , he was reared by thriae , the bee nymphs , who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills . apollo is also said to have invented the lyre , and along with artemis , the art of archery . he then taught to the humans the art of healing and archery . phoebe , his grandmother , gave the oracular shrine of delphi to apollo as a birthday gift . themis inspired him to be the oracular voice of delphi thereon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break python , a chthonic serpent - dragon , was a child of gaia and the guardian of the delphic oracle , whose death was foretold by apollo when he was still in letos womb . python was the nurse of the giant typhon . in most of the traditions , apollo was still a child when he killed python . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break python was sent by hera to hunt the pregnant leto to death , and had assaulted her . to avenge the trouble given to his mother , apollo went in search of python and killed it in the sacred cave at delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from hephaestus . the delphian nymphs who were present encouraged apollo during the battle with the cry " hie paean " . after apollo was victorious , they also brought him gifts and gave the corycian cave to him . according to homer , apollo had encountered and killed the python when he was looking for a place to establish his shrine . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to another version , when leto was in delphi , python had attacked her . apollo defended his mother and killed python . euripides in his iphigenia in aulis gives an account of his fight with python and the events aftermath . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a detailed account of apollos conflict with gaia and zeus ' intervention on behalf of his young son is also given . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made inferior to his , a wish that zeus granted him readily . because of this , athena , who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles , cast her pebbles away in displeasure . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however , apollo had committed a blood murder and had to be purified . because python was a child of gaia , gaia wanted apollo to be banished to tartarus as a punishment . zeus didnt agree and instead exiled his son from olympus , and instructed him to get purified . apollo had to serve as a slave for nine years . after the servitude was over , as per his fathers order , he travelled to the vale of tempe to bath in waters of peneus . there zeus himself performed purificatory rites on apollo . purified , apollo was escorted by his half sister athena to delphi where the oracular shrine was finally handed over to him by gaia . according to a variation , apollo had also travelled to crete , where carmanor purified him . apollo later established the pythian games to appropriate gaia . henceforth , apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder and , made men aware of their guilt and purified them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break soon after , zeus instructed apollo to go to delphi and establish his law . but apollo , disobeying his father , went to the land of hyperborea and stayed there for a year . he returned only after the delphians sang hymns to him and pleaded him to come back . zeus , pleased with his sons integrity , gave apollo the seat next to him on his right side . he also gave to apollo various gifts , like a golden tripod , a golden bow and arrows , a golden chariot and the city of delphi . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break soon after his return , apollo needed to recruit people to delphi . so , when he spotted a ship sailing from crete , he sprang aboard in the form of a dolphin . the crew was awed into submission and followed a course that led the ship to delphi . there apollo revealed himself as a god . initiating them to his service , he instructed them to keep righteousness in their hearts . the pythia was apollos high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies . pythia is arguably the constant favorite of apollo among the mortals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hera once again sent another giant , tityos to rape leto . this time apollo shot him with his arrows and attacked him with his golden sword . according to other version , artemis also aided him in protecting their mother by attacking tityos with her arrows . after the battle zeus finally relented his aid and hurled tityos down to tartarus . there , he was pegged to the rock floor , covering an area of 9 acre , where a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break admetus was the king of pherae , who was known for his hospitality . when apollo was exiled from olympus for killing python , he served as a herdsman under admetus , who was then young and unmarried . apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with admetus during his stay . after completing his years of servitude , apollo went back to olympus as a god . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break because admetus had treated apollo well , the god conferred great benefits on him in return . apollos mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins . by taming a lion and a boar to draw admetus ' chariot . he was present during their wedding to give his blessings . when admetus angered the goddess artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings , apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister . when apollo learnt of admetus ' untimely death , he convinced or tricked the fates into letting admetus live past his time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to another version , or perhaps some years later , when zeus struck down apollos son asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead , apollo in revenge killed the cyclopes , who had fashioned the bolt for zeus . apollo would have been banished to tartarus for this , but his mother leto intervened , and reminding zeus of their old love , pleaded him not to kill their son . zeus obliged and sentenced apollo to one year of hard labor once again under admetus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the love between apollo and admetus was a favored topic of roman poets like ovid and servius . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the fate of niobe was prophesied by apollo while he was still in letos womb . niobe was the queen of thebes and wife of amphion . she displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to leto because she had fourteen children ( niobids ) , seven male and seven female , while leto had only two . she further mocked apollos effeminate appearance and artemis ' manly appearance . leto , insulted by this , told her children to punish niobe . accordingly , apollo killed niobes sons , and artemis her daughters . according to some versions of the myth , among the niobids , chloris and her brother amyclas were not killed because they prayed to leto . amphion , at the sight of his dead sons , either killed himself or was killed by apollo after swearing revenge . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a devastated niobe fled to mount sipylos in asia minor and turned into stone as she wept . her tears formed the river achelous . zeus had turned all the people of thebes to stone and so no one buried the niobids until the ninth day after their death , when the gods themselves entombed them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when chloris married and had children , apollo granted her son nestor the years he had taken away from the niobids . hence , nestor was able to live for 3 generations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break once apollo and poseidon served under the trojan king laomedon in accordance to zeus ' words . apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris . apollo guarded the cattle of laomedon in the valleys of mount ida , while poseidon built the walls of troy . other versions make both apollo and poseidon the builders of the wall . in ovids account , apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in pindars odes , the gods took a mortal named aeacus as their assistant . when the work was completed , three snakes rushed against the wall , and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead , the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by aeacus . apollo immediately prophesied that troy would fall at the hands of aeacuss descendants , the aeacidae ( that is his son telamon joined heracles when he sieged the city during laomedons rule . later , his great - grandson neoptolemus was present in the wooden horse that lead to the downfall of troy ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however , the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised , but also threatened to bind their feet and hands , and sell them as slaves . angered by the unpaid labour and the insults , apollo infected the city with a pestilence and posedion sent the sea monster cetus . to deliver the city from it , laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter hesione ( who would later be saved by heracles ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during his stay in troy , apollo had a lover named ourea , who was a nymph and daughter of poseidon . together they had a son named ileus , whom apollo loved dearly . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo sided with the trojans during the trojan war waged by the greeks against the trojans . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the war , the greek king agamemnon captured chryseis , the daughter of apollos priest chryses , and refused to return her . angered by this , apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the greek encampment . he demanded that they return the girl , and the achaeans ( greeks ) complied , indirectly causing

mopsus , galeus , telmessus and others were gifted seers . anius , pythaeus and ismenus lived as high priests . most of them were trained by apollo himself . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arabus , delphos , dryops , miletos , tenes , epidaurus , ceos , lycoras , syrus , pisus , marathus , megarus , patarus , acraepheus , cicon , chaeron and many other sons of apollo , under the guidance of his words , founded eponymous cities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he also had a son named chrysorrhoas who was a mechanic artist . his other daughters include eurynome , chariclo wife of chiron , eurydice the wife of orpheus , eriopis , famous for her beautiful hair , melite the heroine , pamphile the silk weaver , parthenos , and by some accounts , phoebe , hilyra and scylla . apollo turned parthenos into a constellation after her early death . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break additionally , apollo fostered and educated chiron , the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods , including apollos sons . apollo also fostered carnus , the son of zeus and europa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break marpessa was kidnapped by idas but was loved by apollo as well . zeus made her choose between them , and she chose idas on the grounds that apollo , being immortal , would tire of her when she grew old . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sinope , a nymph , was approached by the amorous apollo . she made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for , and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin . apollo kept his promise and went back . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bolina was admired by apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea . to avoid her death , apollo turned her into a nymph , saving her life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break castalia was a nymph whom apollo loved . she fled from him and dove into the spring at delphi , at the base of mt . parnassos , which was then named after her . water from this spring was sacred ; it was used to clean the delphian temples and inspire the priestesses . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cassandra , was a daughter of hecuba and priam . apollo wished to court her . cassandra promised to return his love on one condition - he should give her the power to see the future . apollo fulfilled her wish , but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after . angered that she broke her promise , apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future , no one would ever believe her prophecies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hestia , the goddess of the hearth , rejected both apollos and poseidons marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break artemis as the sister of apollo , is thea apollousa , that is , she as a female divinity represented the same idea that apollo did as a male divinity . in the pre - hellenic period , their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife , and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described artemis as the wife of apollo . however , this relationship was never sexual but spiritual , which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the hellenic period . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break artemis , like her brother , is armed with a bow and arrows . she is the cause of sudden deaths of women . she also is the protector of the young , especially girls . though she has nothing to do with oracles , music or poetry , she sometimes led the female chorus on olympus while apollo sang . the laurel ( daphne ) was sacred to both . artemis daphnaia had her temple among the lacedemonians , at a place called hypsoi . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo daphnephoros had a temple in eretria , a " place where the citizens are to take the oaths " . in later times when apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or helios , artemis was naturally regarded as selene or the moon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hecate , the goddess of witchcraft and magic , is the chthonic counterpart of apollo . they both are cousins , since their mothers - leto and asteria - are sisters . one of apollos epithets , hecatos , is the masculine form of hecate , and both the names mean " working from afar " . while apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven , hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness . if hecate is the " gate - keeper " , apollo agyieus is the " door - keeper " . hecate is the goddess of crossroads and apollo is the god and protector of streets . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the oldest evidence found for hecates worship is at apollos temple in miletos . there , hecate was taken to be apollos sister counterpart in the absence of artemis . hecates lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements , at the same time , apollos solar nature . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a deity of knowledge and great power , apollo was seen being the male counterpart of athena . being zeus ' favorite children , they were given more powers and duties . apollo and athena often took up the role as protectors of cities , and were patrons of some of the important cities . athena was the principle goddess of athens , apollo was the principle god of sparta . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as patrons of arts , apollo and athena were companions of the muses , the former a much more frequent companion than the latter . apollo was sometimes called the son of athena and hephaestus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the trojan war , as zeus ' executive , apollo is seen holding the aegis like athena usually does . apollos decisions were usually approved by his sister athena , and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by zeus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in aeschylus ' oresteia trilogy , clytemnestra kills her husband , king agamemnon because he had sacrificed their daughter iphigenia to proceed forward with the trojan war . apollo gives an order through the oracle at delphi that agamemnons son , orestes , is to kill clytemnestra and aegisthus , her lover . orestes and pylades carry out the revenge , and consequently orestes is pursued by the erinyes or furies ( female personifications of vengeance ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was justified ; apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father , whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage . they invade his temple , and he drives them away . he says that the matter should be brought before athena . apollo promises to protect orestes , as orestes has become apollos supplicant . apollo advocates orestes at the trial , and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks . as a quintessentially greek god , apollo had no direct roman equivalent , although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus . there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of rome during the reign of tarquinius superbus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s bce , apollos first temple at rome was established in the flaminian fields , replacing an older cult site there known as the " apollinare " . during the second punic war in 212 bce , the ludi apollinares ( " apollonian games " ) were instituted in his honor , on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marcius . in the time of augustus , who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son , his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the battle of actium , which was fought near a sanctuary of apollo , augustus enlarged apollos temple , dedicated a portion of the spoils to him , and instituted quinquennial games in his honour . he also erected a new temple to the god on the palatine hill . sacrifices and prayers on the palatine to apollo and diana formed the culmination of the secular games , held in 17 bce to celebrate the dawn of a new era . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the chief apollonian festival was the pythian games held every four years at delphi and was one of the four great panhellenic games . also of major importance was the delia held every four years on delos . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break athenian annual festivals included the boedromia , metageitnia , pyanepsia , and thargelia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break spartan annual festivals were the carneia and the hyacinthia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break thebes every nine years held the daphnephoria . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollos most common attributes were the bow and arrow . other attributes of his included the kithara ( an advanced version of the common lyre ) , the plectrum and the sword . another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod , representing his prophetic powers . the pythian games were held in apollos honor every four years at delphi . the bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the palm tree was also sacred to apollo because he had been born under one in delos . animals sacred to apollo included wolves , dolphins , roe deer , swans , cicadas ( symbolizing music and song ) , ravens , hawks , crows ( apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers ) , snakes ( referencing apollos function as the god of prophecy ) , mice and griffins , mythical eagle–lion hybrids of eastern origin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break homer and porphyry wrote that apollo had a hawk as his messenger . in many myths apollo is transformed into a hawk . in addition , claudius aelianus wrote that in ancient egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god eusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of apollo in egypt and that the citys symbol is a man with a hawklike face ( horus ) . claudius aelianus wrote that egyptians called apollo horus in their own language . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as god of colonization , apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies , especially during the height of colonization , 750–550 bce . according to greek tradition , he helped cretan or arcadian colonists found the city of troy . however , this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction : hittite cuneiform texts mention an asia minor god called appaliunas or apalunas in connection with the city of wilusa attested in hittite inscriptions , which is now generally regarded as being identical with the greek ilion by most scholars . in this interpretation , apollos title of lykegenes can simply be read as " born in lycia " , which effectively severs the gods supposed link with wolves ( possibly a folk etymology ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in literary contexts , apollo represents harmony , order , and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of dionysus , god of wine , who represents ecstasy and disorder . the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian . however , the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary : the two gods are brothers , and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea , he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus . this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo is often associated with the golden mean . this is the greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo is a common theme in greek and roman art and also in the art of the renaissance . the earliest greek word for a statue is " delight " ( ἄγαλμα , agalma ) , and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision . greek art puts into apollo the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined . the sculptors derived this from observations on human beings , but they also embodied in concrete form , issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body that was essentially a religious activity . the muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the greek desire for health , and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard greek environment . the statues of apollo embody beauty , balance and inspire awe before the beauty of the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break numerous free - standing statues of male youths from archaic greece exist , and were once thought to be representations of apollo , though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals . in 1895 , i . leonardos proposed the term kouros ( " male youth " ) to refer to those from keratea ; this usage was later expanded by henri lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earliest examples of life - sized statues of apollo may be two figures from the ionic sanctuary on the island of delos . such statues were found across the greek speaking world , the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of apollo ptoios , boeotia alone . significantly more rare are the life - sized bronze statues . one of the few originals which survived into the present day—so rare that its discovery in 1959 was described as " a miracle " by ernst homann - wedeking—is the masterpiece bronze , piraeus apollo . it was found in piraeus , a port city close to athens , and is believed to have come from north - eastern peloponnesus . it is the only surviving large - scale peloponnesian statue . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the famous apollo of mantua and its variants are early forms of the apollo citharoedus statue type , in which the god holds the cithara , a sophisticated seven - stringed variant of the lyre , in his left arm . while none of the greek originals have survived , several roman copies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other notable forms are the apollo citharoedus and the apollo barberini . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo as a handsome beardless young man , is often depicted with a cithara ( as apollo citharoedus ) or bow in his hand , or reclining on a tree ( the apollo lykeios and apollo sauroctonos types ) . the apollo belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century ; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of classical antiquity for europeans , from the renaissance through the 19th century . the marble is a hellenistic or roman copy of a bronze original by the greek sculptor leochares , made between 350 and 325 bce . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the life - size so - called " adonis " found in 1780 on the site of a villa suburbana near the via labicana in the roman suburb of centocelle is identified as an apollo by modern scholars . in the late 2nd century ce floor mosaic from el djem , roman thysdrus , he is identifiable as apollo helios by his effulgent halo , though now even a gods divine nakedness is concealed by his cloak , a mark of increasing conventions of modesty in the later empire . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another haloed apollo in mosaic , from hadrumentum , is in the museum at sousse . the conventions of this representation , head tilted , lips slightly parted , large - eyed , curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck , were developed in the 3rd century bce to depict alexander the great . some time after this mosaic was executed , the earliest depictions of christ would also be beardless and haloed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of music , dance and poetry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture . percy bysshe shelley composed a " hymn of apollo " ( 1820 ) , and the gods instruction of the muses formed the subject of igor stravinskys apollon

2018 , 2019 and 2020 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo has been depicted in modern films—for instance , by keith david in the 1997 animated feature film hercules , by luke evans in the 2010 action film

" agassi then dropped out of school in the ninth grade to pursue a full - time tennis career . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agassi turned professional at the age of 16 and competed in his first tournament at la quinta , california . he won his first match against john austin , but then lost his second match to mats wilander . by the end of 1986 , agassi was ranked no . he won his first top - level singles title in 1987 at the sul american open in itaparica during 1988 , he also set the open - era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager ( a record that stood for 17 years until rafael nadal broke it in 2005 ) . his year - end ranking was no . 3 , behind second - ranked ivan lendl and top - ranked mats wilander . both the association of tennis professionals and tennis magazine named agassi the most improved player of the year for 1988 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to not playing the australian open ( which later became his best grand slam event ) for the first eight years of his career , agassi chose not to play at wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the events traditionalism , particularly its " predominantly white " dress code to which players at the event are required to conform . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break strong performances on the tour meant that agassi was quickly tipped as a future grand slam champion . while still a teenager , he reached the semi - finals of both the french open and the us open in 1988 and made the us open semi - finals in 1989 . he began the 1990s with a series of near - misses . he reached his first grand slam final in 1990 at the french open , where he was favored before losing in four sets to andrés gómez , which he later attributed in his book to worrying about his wig falling off during the match . he reached his second grand slam final of the year at the us open , defeating defending champion boris becker in the semi - finals . his opponent in the final was pete sampras ; a year earlier , agassi had crushed sampras , after which time he told his coach that he felt bad for sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro . agassi lost the us open final to sampras in three sets . the rivalry between these two american players became the biggest one in tennis over the rest of the decade . agassi ended 1990 on a high note as he helped the united states win its first davis cup in 8 years and won his only tennis masters cup , beating reigning wimbledon champion stefan edberg in the final . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1991 , agassi reached his second consecutive french open final , where he faced fellow bollettieri academy alumnus jim courier . courier emerged the victor in a five - set final . agassi decided to play at wimbledon in 1991 , leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear . he eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit . he reached the quarterfinals on that occasion , losing in five sets to david wheaton . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agassis grand slam tournament breakthrough came at wimbledon , not at the french open or the us open , where he had previously enjoyed success . in 1992 , he defeated goran ivanišević in a five - set final . along the way , agassi overcame two former wimbledon champions : boris becker and john mcenroe . no other baseliner would triumph at wimbledon until lleyton hewitt ten years later . agassi was named the bbc overseas sports personality of the year in 1992 . agassi once again played on the united states ' davis cup winning team in 1992 . it was their second davis cup title in three years . agassi famously played the game wearing oakley brand sunglasses , and a photo of him from the day appeared on the cover of tennis magazine . in his memoir , he wrote that he was covering up bloodshot eyes from a hangover and claimed that the founder of oakley , jim jannard , had sent him a dodge viper to thank him for the inadvertent publicity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1993 , agassi won the only doubles title of his career , at the cincinnati masters , partnered with petr korda . he missed much of the early part of that year due to injuries . although he made the quarterfinals in his wimbledon title defense , he lost to eventual champion and no . 1 pete sampras in five sets . agassi lost in the first round at the us open to thomas enqvist and required wrist surgery late in the year . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with new coach brad gilbert on board , agassi began to employ more of a tactical , consistent approach , which fueled his resurgence . he started slowly in 1994 , losing in the first week at the french open and wimbledon . nevertheless , he emerged during the hard - court season , winning the canadian open . his comeback culminated at the 1994 us open with a five - set fourth - round victory against michael chang . he then became the first man to capture the us open as an unseeded player , beating michael stich in the final . along the way , he beat 5 seeded players . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1995 , agassi shaved his balding head , breaking with his old " image is everything " style . he competed in the 1995 australian open ( his first appearance at the event ) and won , beating sampras in a four -

round losses to chris woodruff and doug flach at the french open and wimbledon , respectively , and lost to chang in straight sets in the australian and us open semi - finals . at the time , agassi blamed the australian open loss on the windy conditions , but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose , as he did not want to play boris becker , whom he would have faced in that final . the high point for agassi was winning the mens singles gold medal at the olympic games in atlanta , beating sergi bruguera of spain in the final . agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in cincinnati and key biscayne . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 1997 was the low point of agassis career . his wrist injury resurfaced , and he played only 24 matches during the year . he later confessed that he started using crystal methamphetamine at that time , allegedly on the urging of a friend . he failed an atp drug test , but wrote a letter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink . the atp dropped the failed drug test as a warning . in his autobiography , agassi admitted that the letter was a lie . he quit the drug soon after . at this time agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress , model , and socialite brooke shields and had lost interest in the game . he won no top - level titles , and his ranking sank to no . 141 on november 10 , 1997 , prompting many to believe that his run as one of the sports premier competitors was over and he would never again win any significant championships . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1998 , agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in challenger series tournaments , a circuit for pro players ranked outside the worlds top 50 . after returning to top physical and mental shape , agassi recorded the most successful period of his tennis career and also played classic matches in that period against pete sampras and patrick rafter . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1998 , agassi won five titles and leapt from no . 6 , the highest jump into the top 10 made by any player during a calendar year . at wimbledon , he had an early loss in the second round to tommy haas . he won five titles in ten finals and was runner - up at the masters series tournament in key biscayne , losing to marcelo ríos , who became no . 1 as a result . at the year end he was awarded the atp most improved player of the year for the second time in his career ( the first being 10 years earlier in 1988 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat andrei medvedev in a five - set french open final , becoming , at the time , only the fifth male player ( joining rod laver , fred perry , roy emerson and don budge—these have since been joined by roger federer , rafael nadal , and novak djokovic ) to win all four grand slam singles titles during his career . only laver , agassi , federer , nadal and djokovic have achieved this feat during the open era . this win also made him the first ( of only four , the next being federer , nadal and djokovic respectively ) male player in history to have won all four grand slam titles on three different surfaces ( clay , grass and hard courts ) . agassi also became the only male player to win the career super slam , consisting of all four grand slam tournaments plus an olympic gold medal in singles and a year - end championship . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agassi followed his 1999 french open victory by reaching the wimbledon final , where he lost to sampras in straight sets . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he began the next year 2000 by capturing his second australian open title , beating sampras in a five - set semi - final and yevgeny kafelnikov in a four - set final . at the inaugural tennis masters cup in lisbon , agassi reached the final after defeating marat safin in the semi - finals to end the russians hopes to become the youngest no . 1 in the history of tennis . agassi then lost to gustavo kuerten in the final , allowing kuerten to be crowned year -

*********** Article 31: Austroasiatic languages ***********

the austroasiatic languages , also known as mon–khmer , are a large language family in mainland southeast asia and south asia . these languages are scattered throughout parts of thailand , india , bangladesh , nepal , and southern china and are the majority languages of vietnam and cambodia . there are around 117 million speakers of austroasiatic languages . of these languages , only vietnamese , khmer , and mon have a long - established recorded history . only two have official status as modern national languages : vietnamese in vietnam and khmer in cambodia . the mon language is a recognized indigenous language in myanmar and thailand . in myanmar , the wa language is the de facto official language of wa state . santali is one of the 22 scheduled languages of india . the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ethnologue identifies 168 austroasiatic languages . these form thirteen established families ( plus perhaps shompen , which is poorly attested , as a fourteenth ) , which have traditionally been grouped into two , as mon–khmer , and munda . however , one recent classification posits three groups ( munda , mon - khmer , and khasi–khmuic ) , while another has abandoned mon–khmer as a taxon altogether , making it synonymous with the larger family . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across southeast asia and parts of india , bangladesh , nepal and east asia , separated by regions where other languages are spoken . they appear to be the extant original languages of mainland southeast asia ( excluding the andaman islands ) , with the neighboring , and sometimes surrounding , kra–dai , hmong - mien , austronesian , and sino - tibetan languages being the result of later migrations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the name austroasiatic comes from a combination of the latin words for " south " and " asia " , hence " south asia " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break regarding word structure , austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic " sesquisyllabic " pattern , with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial , unstressed , reduced minor syllable followed by a stressed , full syllable . this reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original proto - austroasiatic prefixes , such as the causative prefix , ranging from cvc syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants . as for word formation , most austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes , many have infixes , but suffixes are almost completely non - existent in most branches except munda , and a few specialized exceptions in other austroasiatic branches . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register contrast , either between modal ( normal ) voice and breathy ( lax ) voice or between modal voice and creaky voice . languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have a three - or even four - way voicing contrast . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however , some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases , such as vietnamese , tonogenesis . vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages , whereas khmer , which had more influence from sanskrit , has retained a more typically austroasiatic structure . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break much work has been done on the reconstruction of proto - mon–khmer in harry shortos mon–khmer comparative dictionary . little work has been done on the munda languages , which are not well documented . with their demotion from a primary branch , proto - mon–khmer becomes synonymous with proto - austroasiatic . paul sidwell ( 2005 ) reconstructs the consonant inventory of proto - mon–khmer as follows : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for . is better preserved in the katuic languages , which sidwell has specialized in . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic : the mon–khmer languages of southeast asia , northeast india and the nicobar islands , and the munda languages of east and central india and parts of bangladesh , parts of nepal . however , no evidence for this classification has ever been published . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade . by contrast , the relationships between these families within austroasiatic are debated . in addition to the traditional classification , two recent proposals are given , neither of which accepts traditional " mon–khmer " as a valid unit . however , little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published , and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition , there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese in sumatra ( diffloth ) , the chamic languages of vietnam , and the land dayak languages of borneo ( adelaar 1995 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break diffloths widely cited original classification , now abandoned by diffloth himself , is used in encyclopædia britannica and—except for the breakup of southern mon–khmer—in ethnologue . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break peiros is a lexicostatistic classification , based on percentages of shared vocabulary . this means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact . indeed , when sidwell ( 2009 ) replicated peiross study with languages known well enough to account for loans , he did not find the internal ( branching ) structure below . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades , and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations , though like other classifications the evidence has not been published . as a schematic , we have : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break or in more detail , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break paul sidwell ( 2009 ) , in a lexicostatistical comparison of 36 languages which are well known enough to exclude loanwords , finds little evidence for internal branching , though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages , such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches , without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence . sidwell blench ( 2011 ) discuss this proposal in more detail , and note that there is good evidence for a khasi–palaungic node , which could also possibly be closely related to khmuic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if this would the case , sidwell blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward . sidwell blench ( 2011 ) suggest shompen as an additional branch , and believe that a vieto - katuic connection is worth investigating . in general , however , the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed , since proto - austroasiatic speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break subsequently , sidwell ( 2015a : 179 ) proposed that nicobarese subgroups with aslian , just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each other . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis ( sidwell 2015b ) suggests that austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake - like structure , with an east–west division ( consisting of munda , khasic , palaungic , and khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches ) occurring possibly as early as 7000 years before present . however , he still considers the subbranching dubious . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings , paul sidwell ( 2015c ) further expanded his mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into indochina from the lingnan area of southern china , with the subsequent mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of neolithic farmers from southern china . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sidwell ( 2015c ) tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up 5000 years during the neolithic transition era of mainland southeast asia , with all the major branches of austroasiatic formed by 4000 austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the pearl river watershed of lingnan , which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of vietnam , or downstream through the mekong river via yunnan . both the reconstructed lexicon of proto - austroasiatic and the archaeological record clearly show that early austroasiatic speakers around 4000 cultivated rice and millet , kept livestock such as dogs , pigs , and chickens , and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at 4500 , this " neolithic package " suddenly arrived in indochina from the lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier pre - neolithic hunter - gatherer cultures , with grain husks found in northern indochina by 4100 and in southern indochina by 3800 however , sidwell ( 2015c ) found that iron is not reconstructable in proto - austroasiatic , since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from tai , chinese , tibetan , malay , and other languages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the iron age about 2500 , relatively young austroasiatic branches in indochina such as vietic , katuic , pearic , and khmer were formed , while the more internally diverse bahnaric branch ( dating to about 3000 ) underwent more extensive internal diversification . by the iron age , all of the austroasiatic branches were more or less in their present - day locations , with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking place during the iron age . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break paul sidwell ( 2018 ) considers the austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around 4000 years during the arrival of rice agriculture in indochina , but notes that the origin of proto - austroasiatic itself is older than that date . the lexicon of proto - austroasiatic can be divided into an early and late stratum . the early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts , animal names , natural features , and pronouns , while the names of cultural items ( agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts , which are reconstructible in proto - austroasiatic ) form part of the later stratum . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break roger blench ( 2017 ) suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies ( such as boats , waterways , river fauna , and fish capture techniques ) can be reconstructed for proto - austroasiatic . blench ( 2017 ) finds widespread austroasiatic roots for ' river , valley ' , ' boat ' , ' fish ' , ' catfish sp . , ' eel ' , ' prawn ' , ' shrimp ' ( central austroasiatic ) , ' crab ' , ' tortoise ' , ' turtle ' , ' otter ' , ' crocodile ' , ' heron , fishing bird ' , and ' fish trap ' . archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern indochina ( northern vietnam , laos , and other nearby areas ) dates back to only about 4000 years ago ( 2000 bc ) , with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the yangtze valley where it has been dated to 6000 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sidwell ( 2022 ) proposes that the locus of proto - austroasiatic was in the red river delta area about 4000 - 4500 years before present , instead of the middle mekong as he had previously proposed . austroasiatic dispersed coastal maritime routes and also upstream through river valleys . khmuic , palaungic , and khasic resulted from a westward dispersal that ultimately came from the red valley valley . based on their current distributions , about half of all austroasiatic branches ( including nicobaric and munda ) can be traced to coastal maritime dispersals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hence , this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to sino - tibetan , whose speakers had a distinct non - riverine culture . in addition to living an aquatic - based lifestyle , early austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock , crops , and newer types of watercraft . as early austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways , they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area , such as sino - tibetan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sidwell ( 2018 ) ( quoted in sidwell 2021 ) gives a more nested classification of austroasiatic branches as suggested by his computational phylogenetic analysis of austroasiatic languages using a 200 - word list . many of the tentative groupings are likely linkages . pakanic and shompen were not included . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break roger blench ( 2009 ) also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of austroasiatic that are now extinct , based on substrate evidence in modern - day languages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other languages with proposed austroasiatic substrata are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break john peterson ( 2017 ) suggests that " pre - munda " ( " proto - " in regular terminology ) languages may have once dominated the eastern indo - gangetic plain , and were then absorbed by indo - aryan languages at an early date as indo - aryan spread east . peterson notes that eastern indo - aryan languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of munda languages , while western indo - aryan languages do not . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other than latin - based alphabets , many austroasiatic languages are written with the khmer , thai , lao , and burmese alphabets . vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on chinese logographic writing . this has since been supplanted by the latin alphabet in the 20th century . the following are examples of past - used alphabets or current alphabets of austroasiatic languages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break austroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial austric hypothesis , which also includes the austronesian languages , and in some proposals also the kra–dai languages and the hmong–mien languages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several lexical resemblances are found between the hmong - mien and austroasiatic language families ( ratliff 2010 ) , some of which had earlier been proposed by haudricourt ( 1951 ) . this could imply a relation or early language contact along the yangtze . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to cai ( and others 2011 ) , hmong–mien is at least partially related to austroasiatic but was heavily influenced by sino - tibetan , especially tibeto - burman languages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is suggested that the austroasiatic languages have some influence on indo - aryan languages including sanskrit and middle indo - aryan languages . indian linguist suniti kumar chatterji pointed that a specific number of substantives in languages such as hindi , punjabi and bengali were borrowed from munda languages . additionally , french linguist jean przyluski suggested a similarity between the tales from the austroasiatic realm and the indian mythological stories of matsyagandha ( from mahabharata ) and the nāgas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mitsuru sakitani suggests that haplogroup o1b1 , which is common in austroasiatic people and some other ethnic groups in southern china , and haplogroup o1b2 , which is common in today japanese , koreans and some manchu , are the carriers of early rice - agriculturalists from indochina . another study suggests that the haplogroup o1b1 is the major austroasiatic paternal lineage and o1b2 the " para - austroasiatic " lineage of the mandchurian , korean and yayoi people . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a 2021 study by tagore and others found that the proto - austroasiatic speakers split from an basal east asian source population , native to mainland southeast asia and northeast india , which also gave rise to other east asian - related populations , including northeast asians and indigenous peoples of the americas . the proto - austroasiatic speakers can be linked to the hoabinhian material culture . from mainland southeast asia , the austroasiatic speakers expanded into the indian - subcontinent and maritime southeast asia . there is evidence that later back migration from more northerly east asian groups ( such as kra - dai speakers ) merged with indigenous southeast asians , contributing to the fragmentation observed among modern day austroasiatic - speakers . in the indian subcontinent , austroasiatic speakers , specifically mundari , intermixed with the local population . furthermore they concluded that their results do not support a genetic relationship between ancient southeast asian hunter - gatherers ( hoabinhians ) with papuan - related groups , as previously suggested by mccoll and others 2018 , but that these ancient southeast asians are characterized by basal east asian ancestry . the authors finally concluded that genetics do not necessarily correspond with linguistic identity , pointing to the fragmentation of modern austroasiatic speakers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break larena and others 2021 could reproduce the genetic evidence for the origin of basal east asians in mainland southeast asia , which are estimated to have formed about 50kya years ago , and expanded through multiple migration waves southwards and northwards . early austroasiatic speakers are estimated to have originated from an lineage , which split from ancestral east asians between 25000 to 15000 years ago , and were among the first wave to replace distinct australasian - related groups in insular southeast asia . east asian - related ancestry became dominant in insular southeast asia already between 15000 years to 12000 years ago , and may be associated with austroasiatic groups , which however got again replaced by later austronesian groups some 10000 to 7000 years ago . early austroasiatic people were found to be best represented by the mlabri people in modern day thailand . proposals for austroasiatic substratum among later austronesian languages in western indonesia , noteworthy among the dayak languages , is strengthened by genetic data , suggesting austroasiatic speakers were assimilated by austronesian speakers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a study in november 2021 ( guo and others ) found that modern east - eurasians can be modeled from four ancestry components , which descended from a common ancestor in mainland southeast asia , one being the " ancestral austroasiatic " component ( aaa ) , which is more prevalent among modern southeast asians , and making up the exclusive ancestry among austroasiatic - speaking lua and mlabri people . the early austroasiatic speakers are suggested to have been hunter - gatherers but became rice - agriculturalists quite early , spreading from mainland southeast asia northwards to the yangtze river , westwards into the indian subcontinent , and southwards into insular southeast asia . evidence for these migrations are austroasiatic loanwords related to rice - agriculture found among non - austroasiatic languages , and the presence of austroasiatic genetic ancestry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to a recent genetic study , sundanese , javanese , and balinese , has almost an equal ratio of genetic marker shared between austronesian and austroasiatic heritages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to chaubey and others , " austro - asiatic speakers in india today are derived from dispersal from southeast asia , followed by extensive sex - specific admixture with local indian populations . " according to riccio and others , the munda people are likely descended from austroasiatic migrants from southeast asia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to zhang and others , austroasiatic migrations from southeast asia into india took place after the last glacial maximum , circa 10000 years ago . arunkumar et al , suggest austroasiatic migrations from southeast asia occurred into northeast india 5 ± 0 kya and into east india 4 ± 0 kya . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 32: Afroasiatic languages ***********

the afroasiatic languages ( or afro - asiatic ) , also known as hamito - semitic , or semito - hamitic , and sometimes also as afrasian or erythraean , are a language family of about 300 languages that are spoken predominantly in western asia , north africa , the horn of africa , and parts of the sahara / sahel . with the exception of its semitic branch , all other branches of the afroаsiatic family are spoken exclusively on the african continent . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afroasiatic languages have over 500 million native speakers , which is the fourth - largest number of native speakers of any language family ( after indo - european , sino - tibetan , and niger–congo ) . the phylum has six branches : berber , chadic , cushitic , egyptian , semitic , and omotic . the most widely spoken modern afroasiatic language or dialect continuum by far is arabic , a de facto group of distinct language varieties within the semitic branch . the languages that evolved from proto - arabic have around 313 million native speakers , concentrated primarily in the middle east and north africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to the languages spoken today , afroasiatic includes several important ancient languages , such as egyptian , which forms a distinct branch of the family ; and within the semitic family , akkadian , biblical hebrew , and old aramaic . while there is no consensus among historical linguists concerning the original homeland of the afroasiatic family or the period when the parent language ( that is proto - afroasiatic ) was spoken , most agree that it was located within a region of northeast africa . proposed specific locations include the horn of africa , egypt , the eastern sahara , and the levant . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the early 19th century , linguists grouped the berber , cushitic and egyptian languages within a " hamitic " phylum , in acknowledgement of these languages ' genetic relation with each other and with those in the semitic phylum . the terms " hamitic " and " semitic " were etymologically derived from the book of genesis , which describes various biblical tribes descended from ham and shem , two sons of noah . by the 1860s , the main constituent elements within the broader afroasiatic family had been worked out . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break friedrich müller introduced the name " hamito - semitic " for the entire language family in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft ( 1876 ) . maurice delafosse ( 1914 ) later coined the term " afroasiatic " ( often now spelled " afro - asiatic " ) . however , it did not come into general use until joseph greenberg ( 1950 ) formally proposed its adoption . in doing so , greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that ' hamitic ' was not a valid group and that language cladistics did not reflect race . in current scholarly usage , the most commonly used names are " afroasiatic " , " hamito - semitic " , and " semito - hamitic " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break individual scholars have also called the family " erythraean " ( tucker 1966 ) and " lisramic " ( hodge 1972 ) . in lieu of " hamito - semitic " , the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term " afrasian " , meaning " half african , half asiatic " , in reference to the geographic distribution of the familys constituent languages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break scholars generally treat the afroasiatic language family as including at least the following five branches : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a sixth familys inclusion in afroasiatic is disputed : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although there is general agreement on these six families , linguists who study afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement , in particular : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in descending order of the number of speakers , widely - spoken afroasiatic languages include : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break classification history uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 9th century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn quraysh of tiaret in algeria became the first to link two branches of afroasiatic together ; he perceived a relationship between berber and semitic . he knew of semitic through his study of arabic , hebrew , and aramaic . in the course of the 19th century , europeans also began suggesting such relationships . in 1844 , theodor benfey proposed a language family consisting of semitic , berber , and cushitic ( he called the latter " ethiopic " ) . in the same year newman suggested a relationship between semitic and hausa , but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break friedrich müller named the traditional hamito - semitic family in 1876 in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft ( " outline of linguistics " ) , and defined it as consisting of a semitic group plus a " hamitic " group containing egyptian , berber , and cushitic ; he excluded the chadic group . it was the egyptologist karl richard lepsius ( 1810–1884 ) who restricted hamitic to the non - semitic languages in africa , which are characterized by a grammatical gender system . this " hamitic language group " was proposed to unite various , mainly north - african , languages , including the ancient egyptian language , the berber languages , the cushitic languages , the beja language , and the chadic languages . unlike müller , lepsius saw hausa and nama as part of the hamitic group . these classifications relied in part on non - linguistic anthropological and racial arguments . both authors used the skin - color , mode of subsistence , and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments for grouping particular languages together . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1912 , carl meinhof published die sprachen der hamiten ( " the languages of the hamites " ) , in which he expanded lepsiuss model , adding the fula , maasai , bari , nandi , sandawe and hadza languages to the hamitic group . meinhofs model was widely supported in the 1940s . meinhofs system of classification of the hamitic languages was based on a belief that " speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially caucasian origins , intrinsically different from and superior to the ' negroes of africa ' . " however , in the case of the so - called nilo - hamitic languages ( a concept he introduced ) , it was based on the typological feature of gender and a " fallacious theory of language mixture " . meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub " nilo - hamitic " were in fact nilotic languages , with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other nilotic languages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break leo reinisch ( 1909 ) had already proposed linking cushitic and chadic while urging their more distant affinity with egyptian and semitic . however , his suggestion found little acceptance . marcel cohen ( 1924 ) rejected the idea of a distinct " hamitic " subgroup and included hausa ( a chadic language ) in his comparative hamito - semitic vocabulary . finally , joseph greenbergs 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of " hamitic " as a language category by linguists . greenberg refuted meinhofs linguistic theories and rejected the use of racial and social evidence . in dismissing the notion of a separate " nilo - hamitic " language category , in particular , greenberg was " returning to a view widely held a half - century earlier " . he consequently rejoined meinhofs so - called nilo - hamitic languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings . he also added ( and sub - classified ) the chadic languages , and proposed a new name , " afroasiatic " , for the family . almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break greenberg developed his model fully in his book the languages of africa ( 1963 ) , in which he reassigned most of meinhofs additions to hamitic to other language families , notably nilo - saharan . following isaac schapera and rejecting meinhof , he classified the khoekhoe language as a member of the khoisan languages , a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of click sounds . to khoisan he also added the tanzanian hadza and sandawe , though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages regard them as linguistic isolates . despite this , greenbergs classification remains a starting point for modern work on many languages spoken in africa , and the hamitic category ( and its extension to nilo - hamitic ) has no part in this . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since the three traditional branches of the hamitic languages ( berber , cushitic and egyptian ) have not been shown to form an exclusive ( monophyletic ) phylogenetic unit of their own , separate from other afroasiatic languages , linguists no longer use the term in this sense . each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger afroasiatic family . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1969 , harold fleming proposed that what had previously been known as western cushitic is an independent branch of afroasiatic , suggesting for it the new name " omotic " . this proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break based on typological differences with the other cushitic languages , robert hetzron proposed that beja has to be removed from cushitic , thus forming an independent branch of afroasiatic . most scholars , however , reject this proposal , and continue to group beja as the sole member of a northern branch within cushitic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break glottolog does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of omotic has been established , nor that of ongota or the unclassified kujarge . it therefore splits off the following groups as small families : south omotic , mao , dizoid , gonga–gimojan ( north omotic apart from the preceding ) , ongota , and kujarge . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break little agreement exists on the subgrouping of the five or six branches of afroasiatic : semitic , egyptian , berber , chadic , cushitic , and omotic . however , christopher ehret ( 1979 ) , harold fleming ( 1981 ) , and joseph greenberg ( 1981 ) all agree that the omotic branch split from the rest first . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break otherwise : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earliest written evidence of an afroasiatic language is an ancient egyptian inscription dated to c . 3400 bc ( 5400 years ago ) . symbols on gerzean ( naqada ii ) pottery resembling egyptian hieroglyphs date back to c . 4000 bc , suggesting an earlier possible dating . this gives us a minimum date for the age of afroasiatic . however , ancient egyptian is highly divergent from proto - afroasiatic , and considerable time must have elapsed in between them . estimates of the date at which the proto - afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely . they fall within a range between approximately 7500 bc ( 9500 years ago ) , and approximately 16000 bc ( 18000 years ago ) . according to igor diakonoff ( 1988 : 33n ) , proto - afroasiatic was spoken c . christopher ehret ( 2002 : 35–36 ) asserts that proto - afroasiatic was spoken c . 11000 bc at the latest , and possibly as early as c . these dates are older than those associated with other proto - languages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the afroasiatic urheimat , the hypothetical place where proto - afroasiatic language speakers lived in a single linguistic community , or complex of communities , before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages , is unknown . afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in west asia , north africa , the horn of africa , and parts of the sahel . their distribution seems to have been influenced by the sahara pump operating over the last 10000 years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while there is no definitive agreement on when or where the original homeland of this language family existed , some link the first speakers to the first farmers in the levant who would later spread to north and east africa . others argue the first speakers were pre - agricultural and based in northeast africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an indigenous african origin in northeast africa is supported by linguistic and archaeogenetic data , but not undisputed . this region includes the majority of the diversity of the afroasiatic language family and has very diverse groups in close geographic proximity , sometimes considered a telltale sign for a linguistic geographic origin . it is argued that a subset of proto - afroasiatic - speakers , having developed subsistence patterns of intensive plant collection and pastoralism , migrated northwards from the horn of africa or the eastern sahara into modern day egypt and the levant during the late paleolithic , merging with local populations of largely west - eurasian ancestry , resulting in a population which would later give rise to the natufian culture , which is frequently associated with early afroasiatic - speaking or specifically semitic - speaking communities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break roger blench has proposed southwestern ethiopia as the most likely urheimat of the afroasiatic language due to the high internal diversification of the omotic branch spoken in that region . a 2018 analysis of autosomal dna using modern populations as a reference found that the ancient natufian samples harbored a distinct ancestral component indigenous to the horn of africa , most prevalent among omotic - speakers in southwestern ethiopia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break similarities in grammar and syntax uvmr_ev_paragraph_break widespread ( though not universal ) features of the afroasiatic languages include : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one of the most remarkable shared features among the afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation ( see the table at right ) , with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with / ʔ t n j / , and in particular a pattern whereby third - singular masculine / j - / is opposed to third - singular feminine and second - singular / t - / . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to ehret ( 1996 ) , tonal languages appear in the omotic and chadic branches of afroasiatic , as well as in certain cushitic languages . the semitic , berber and egyptian branches generally do not use tones phonemically . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the berber and semitic branches share certain grammatical features ( for example alternative feminine endings - ay / - āy ; corresponding vowel templates for verbal conjugations ) which can be reconstructed for a higher - order proto - language ( provisionally called " proto - berbero - semitic " by kossmann suchard ( 2018 ) and putten ( 2018 ) ) . whether this proto - language is ancestral to berber and semitic only , or also to other branches of afroasiatic , still remains to be established . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the following are some examples of afroasiatic cognates , including ten pronouns , three nouns , and three verbs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are two etymological dictionaries of afroasiatic , one by christopher ehret , and one by vladimir orel and olga stolbova . the two dictionaries disagree on almost everything . the following table contains the thirty roots or so ( out of thousands ) that represent a fragile consensus of present research : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break -

*********** Article 33: Andorra ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break andorra is the sixth - smallest state in europe , with an area of 468 km2 and a population of approximately . the andorran people are a romance ethnic group of originally catalan descent . andorra is the worlds 16th - smallest country by land and 11th - smallest by population . its capital , andorra la vella , is the highest capital city in europe , at an elevation of 1023 m above sea level . the official language is catalan , but spanish , portuguese , and french are also commonly spoken . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tourism in andorra sees an estimated 10 million visitors annually . andorra is not a member state of the european union , but the euro is its official currency . it has been a member of the united nations since 1993 . in 2013 , andorra had the highest life expectancy in the world at 81 years , according to the global burden of disease study ; in 2019 , it had the 23rd - highest at 81 years , according to the united nations development programme . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the origin of the word andorra is unknown , although several hypotheses have been formulated . the oldest derivation is from the greek historian polybius ( the histories iii , 35 , 1 ) , who describes the andosins , an iberian pre - roman tribe , as historically located in the valleys of andorra and facing the carthaginian army in its passage through the pyrenees during the punic wars . the word andosini or andosins ( ἀνδοσίνοι ) may derive from the basque handia , meaning " big " or " giant " . the andorran toponymy shows evidence of basque language in the area . another theory suggests that the word andorra may derive from the old word anorra that contains the basque word ur ( water ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another theory suggests that andorra may derive from , meaning " the thickly wooded place " . when the arabs and moors conquered the iberian peninsula , the valleys of the high pyrenees were covered by large tracts of forest . these regions were not administered by muslims , because of the geographic difficulty of direct rule . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other theories suggest that the term derives from the navarro - aragonese " andurrial " , which means " land covered with bushes " or " scrubland " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the folk etymology holds that charlemagne had named the region as a reference to the biblical canaanite valley of endor or andor ( where the midianites had been defeated ) , a name bestowed by his heir and son louis the pious after defeating the moors in the " wild valleys of hell " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break la balma de la margineda , found by archaeologists at sant julià de lòria , was settled in 9500 bc as a passing place between the two sides of the pyrenees . the seasonal camp was perfectly located for hunting and fishing by the groups of hunter - gatherers from ariege and segre . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the neolithic age , a group of people moved to the valley of madriu ( the present - day natural parc located in escaldes - engordany declared unesco world heritage site ) as a permanent camp in 6640 bc . the population of the valley grew cereals , raised domestic livestock , and developed a commercial trade with people from the segre and occitania . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other archaeological deposits include the tombs of segudet ( ordino ) and feixa del moro ( sant julià de lòria ) , both dated in 4900–4300 bc as an example of the urn culture in andorra . the model of small settlements began to evolve to a complex urbanism during the bronze age . metallurgical items of iron , ancient coins , and relicaries can be found in the ancient sanctuaries scattered around the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the sanctuary of roc de les bruixes ( stone of the witches ) is perhaps the most important archeological complex of this age in andorra , located in the parish of canillo , about the rituals of funerals , ancient scripture and engraved stone murals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the inhabitants of the valleys were traditionally associated with the iberians and historically located in andorra as the iberian tribe andosins or andosini ( ἀνδοσίνους ) during the 7th and 2nd centuries bc . influenced by the aquitanian , basque and iberian languages , the locals developed some current toponyms early writings and documents relating to this group of people goes back to the second century bc by the greek writer polybius in his histories during the punic wars . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some of the most significant remains of this era are the castle of the roc denclar ( part of the early marca hispanica ) , lanxiu in les escaldes and roc de loral in encamp . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the presence of roman influence is recorded from the 2nd century bc to the 5th century ad . the places with the most roman presence are in camp vermell ( red field ) in sant julià de lòria , and in some places in encamp , as well as in the roc denclar . people continued trading , mainly with wine and cereals , with the roman cities of urgellet ( the present - day la seu durgell ) and all across segre through the via romana strata ceretana ( also known as strata confluetana ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the fall of the roman empire , andorra came under the influence of the visigoths , the kingdom of toledo , and the diocese of urgell . the visigoths remained in the valleys for 200 years , during which time christianity spread . when the muslim empire of al - andalus replaced the ruling visigoths in most of the iberian peninsula , andorra was sheltered from these invaders by the franks . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tradition holds that charles the great ( charlemagne ) granted a charter to the andorran people for a contingent of 5000 soldiers under the command of marc almugaver , in return for fighting against the moors near porté - puymorens ( cerdanya ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break andorra remained part of the frankish marca hispanica , the buffer zone between the frankish empire and the muslim territories , andorra being part of the territory ruled by the count of urgell and eventually the bishop of the diocese of urgell . tradition also holds that it was guaranteed by the son of charlemagne , louis the pious , writing the carta de poblament or a local municipal charter circa 805 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 988 , borrell ii , count of urgell , gave the andorran valleys to the diocese of urgell in exchange for land in cerdanya . since then , the bishop of urgell , based in seu durgell , has been co - prince of andorra . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first document that mentions andorra as a territory is the acta de consagració i dotació de la catedral de la seu durgell ( deed of consecration and endowment of the cathedral of la seu durgell ) . the document , dated 839 , depicts the six old parishes of the andorran valleys that made up the countrys administrative division . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before 1095 , andorra had no military protection , and the bishop of urgell , who knew that the count of urgell wanted to reclaim the andorran valleys , married the count of foix , roger - bernard ii . roger - bernard ii and ermessenda shared rule over andorra with the bishop of urgell . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 13th century , a military dispute arose between the bishop of urgell and the count of foix as aftermath of the cathar crusade . the conflict was resolved in 1278 with the mediation of the king of aragon , peter iii , between the bishop and the count , by the signing of the first paréage , which provided that andorras sovereignty be shared between the count of foix ( whose title would ultimately transfer to the french head of state ) and the bishop of urgell , in catalonia . this gave the principality its territory and political form . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a second paréage was signed in 1288 after a dispute when the count of foix ordered the construction of a castle in roc denclar . the document was ratified by the noble notary jaume orig of puigcerdà , and construction of military structures in the country was prohibited . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1364 , the political organization of the country named the figure of the syndic ( now spokesman and president of the parliament ) as representative of the andorrans to their co - princes , making possible the creation of local departments ( comuns , quarts and veïnats ) . after being ratified by bishop francesc tovia and count john i , the consell de la terra or consell general de les valls ( general council of the valleys ) was founded in 1419 , the second oldest parliament in europe . the syndic andreu dalàs and the general council organized the creation of the justice courts ( la cort de justicia ) in 1433 with the co - princes and the collection of taxes like foc i lloc ( literally " fire and site " , a national tax active since then ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although there are remains of ecclesiastical works dating before the 9th century ( sant vicenç denclar or església de santa coloma ) , andorra developed exquisite romanesque art during the 9th through 14th centuries , particularly in the construction of churches , bridges , religious murals and statues of the virgin and child ( our lady of meritxell being the most important ) . nowadays , the romanesque buildings that form part of andorras cultural heritage stand out in a remarkable way , with an emphasis on església de sant esteve , sant joan de caselles , església de sant miquel dengolasters , sant martí de la cortinada and the medieval bridges of margineda and escalls among many others . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the catalan pyrenees were embryonic of the catalan language at the end of the 11th century . andorra was influenced by this language , which was adopted locally many years before it expanded to the rest of the crown of aragon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the local economy during the middle ages was based on livestock , agriculture , furs and weavers . later , at the end of the 11th century , the first iron foundries began to appear in northern parishes like ordino , much appreciated by the master artisans who developed the art of the forges , an important economic activity in the country from the 15th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1601 , the tribunal de corts ( high court of justice ) was created as a result of huguenot rebellions in france , inquisition courts coming from spain and witchcraft - related beliefs native to the area , in the context of the reformation and counter - reformation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the passage of time , the co - title to andorra passed to the kings of navarre . after henry iii of navarre became king of france , he issued an edict in 1607 that established the head of the french state and the bishop of urgell as co - princes of andorra , a political arrangement that still holds . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during 1617 , communal councils form the sometent ( popular militia or army ) to deal with the rise of bandolerisme ( brigandage ) and the consell de la terra was defined and structured in terms of its composition , organization and competences current today . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break andorra continued with the same economic system that it had during the 12th–14th centuries with a large production of metallurgy ( fargues , a system similar to farga catalana ) and with the introduction of tobacco circa 1692 and import trade . in 1371 , and 1448 , the co - princes ratified the fair of andorra la vella , the most important annual national festival commercially ever since . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the country had a unique and experienced guild of weavers , confraria de paraires i teixidors , in escaldes - engordany . founded in 1604 , it took advantage of the local thermal waters . by this time , the country was characterized by the social system of prohoms ( wealthy society ) and casalers ( rest of the population with smaller economic acquisition ) , deriving from the tradition of pubilla and hereu . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break three centuries after its foundation , the consell de la terra located its headquarters and the tribunal de corts in casa de la vall in 1702 . the manor house built in 1580 served as a noble fortress of the busquets family . inside the parliament was placed the closet of the six keys ( armari de les sis claus ) , representative of each andorran parish , where the andorran constitution and other documents and laws were later kept . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in both the reapers ' war and the war of the spanish succession , the andorran people ( while professing to be a neutral country ) supported the catalans who saw their rights reduced in 1716 . the reaction was the promotion of catalan writings in andorra , with cultural works such as the book of privileges ( llibre de privilegis de 1674 ) , manual digest ( 1748 ) by antoni fiter i rossell or the polità andorrà ( 1763 ) by antoni puig . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the french revolution , napoleon i reestablished the co - principate in 1809 and removed the french medieval title . in 1812–1813 , the first french empire annexed catalonia during the peninsular war ( guerra peninsular ) and divided the region into four départements , with andorra as a part of the district of puigcerdà . in 1814 , an imperial decree reestablished the independence and economy of andorra . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during this period , andorras late medieval institutions and rural culture remained largely unchanged . in 1866 , the syndic guillem dareny - plandolit led the reformist group in a council general of 24 members elected by suffrage limited to heads of families . the council general replaced the aristocratic oligarchy that previously ruled the state . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the new reform ( nova reforma ) began after ratification by both co - princes and established the basis of the constitution and symbolssuch as the tricolour flagof andorra . a new service economy arose as a demand of the valley inhabitants and began to build infrastructure such as hotels , spa resorts , roads and telegraph lines . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the authorities of the co - princes banned casinos and betting houses throughout the country . the ban resulted in an economic conflict and the revolution of 1881 , which began when revolutionaries assaulted the house of the syndic on 8 december 1880 , and established the provisional revolutionary council led by joan pla i calvo and pere baró i mas . the provisional revolutionary council allowed for the construction of casinos and spas by foreign companies . from 7 to 9 june 1881 , the loyalists of canillo and encamp reconquered the parishes of ordino and la massana by establishing contact with the revolutionary forces in escaldes - engordany . after a day of combat the treaty of the bridge of escalls was signed on 10 june . the council was replaced and new elections were held . the economic situation worsened , as the populace was divided over the qüestió dandorra– the " andorran question " in relation to the eastern question . the struggles continued between pro - bishops , pro - french , and nationalists based on the troubles of canillo in 1882 and 1885 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break andorra participated in the cultural movement of the catalan renaixença . between 1882 and 1887 , the first academic schools were formed where trilingualism coexisted with the official language , catalan . romantic authors from france and spain reported the awakening of the national consciousness of the country . jacint verdaguer lived in ordino during the 1880s where he wrote and shared works related to the renaixença with writer and photographer , joaquim de riba . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1848 , fromental halévy had premiered the opera le val dandorre to great success in europe , where the national consciousness of the valleys was exposed in the romantic work during the peninsular war . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1933 , france occupied andorra following social unrest which occurred before elections due to the revolution of 1933 and the fhasa strikes ( vagues de fhasa ) ; the revolt led by joves andorrans ( a labour union group related to the spanish cnt and fai ) called for political reforms , the universal suffrage vote of all andorrans and acted in defense of the rights of local and foreign workers during the construction of fhasas hydroelectric power station in encamp . on 5 april 1933 joves andorrans seized the andorran parliament . these actions were preceded by the arrival of colonel rené - jules baulard with 50 gendarmes and the mobilization of 200 local militias or sometent led by the síndic francesc cairat . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on 6 july 1934 , adventurer and nobleman boris skossyreff , with his promise of freedoms and modernization of the country and wealth through the establishment of a tax haven and foreign investments , received the support of the members of the general council to proclaim himself the sovereign of andorra . on 8 july 1934 boris issued a proclamation in urgell , declaring himself boris i , king of andorra , simultaneously declaring war on the bishop of urgell and approving the kings constitution on 10 july . he was arrested by the co - prince and bishop justí guitart i vilardebó and their authorities on 20 july and ultimately expelled from spain . from 1936 until 1940 , a french military detachment of garde mobile led by well - known colonel rené - jules baulard was garrisoned in andorra to secure the principality against disruption from the spanish civil war and francoist spain and also face the rise of republicanism in the aftermath of the 1933 revolution . during the spanish civil war , the inhabitants of andorra welcomed refugees from both sides , and many of them settled permanently in the country thus contributing to the subsequent economic boom and the entry into the capitalist era of andorra . francoist troops reached the andorran border in the later stages of the war . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during world war ii , andorra remained neutral and was an important smuggling route between vichy france and francoist spain , two fascist states . many andorrans criticized the passivity of the general council for impeding both the entry and expulsion of foreigners and refugees , committing economic crimes , reducing the rights of citizens and sympathy with francoism . general council members justified the councils political and diplomatic actions as necessary for andorras survival and the protection of its sovereignty . andorra was relatively unscathed by the two world wars and the spanish civil war . certain groups formed to help victims of oppression in nazi - occupied countries , while participating in smuggling to help andorra survive . among the most prominent was the hostal palanques evasion network command , which , in contact with the british mi6 , helped almost 400 fugitives , among whom were allied military personnel . the command remained active between 1941 and 1944 , although there were struggles with pro - axis informers and gestapo agents in andorra . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the capital city there was a smuggling black market of propaganda , culture and cinematic art not favorable to totalitarian regimes , promulgated in such places as the hotel mirador or the casino hotel , as a meeting place for people of ideologies close to andorran and spanish republicanism and free france . the network was maintained after the war , when film societies were formed , where movies , music and books censored in francos spain were imported , becoming an anti - censorship attraction for the catalan or foreign public even within andorra . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the andorran opening to the capitalist economy resulted in two axes : mass tourism and the countrys tax exemption . the first steps toward the capitalist boom date from the 1930s , with the construction of fhasa and the creation of professional banking with banc agrícol ( 1930 ) and crèdit andorrà ( 1949 ) , later with banca mora ( 1952 ) , banca cassany ( 1958 ) and sobanca ( 1960 ) . shortly after activities such as skiing and shopping become a tourist attraction , with the inauguration of ski resorts and cultural entities in the late 1930s . all in all , a renovated hotel industry has developed . in april 1968 a social health insurance system was created ( cass ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the andorran government necessarily involved planning , projection and forecasts for the future : with the official visit of the french co -

*********** Article 34: Arithmetic mean ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in mathematics and statistics , the arithmetic mean ( ) or arithmetic average , or simply just the mean or the average ( when the context is clear ) , is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection . the collection is often a set of results of an experiment or an observational study , or frequently a set of results from a survey . the term " arithmetic mean " is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics , because it helps distinguish it from other means , such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to mathematics and statistics , the arithmetic mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as economics , anthropology and history , and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent . for example , per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nations population . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies , it is not a robust statistic , meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers ( values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values ) . for skewed distributions , such as the distribution of income for which a few peoples incomes are substantially greater than most peoples , the arithmetic mean may not coincide with ones notion of " middle " , and robust statistics , such as the median , may provide better description of central tendency . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break given a data set x x1 , ldots , xn , the arithmetic mean ( or mean or average ) , denoted barx ( read x bar ) , is the mean of the n values x1 , x2 , ldots , xn . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the arithmetic mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in a data set . in statistics , the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency . the arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation , divided by the total number of observations . symbolically , if we have a data set consisting of the values a1 , a2 , ldots , an , then the arithmetic mean a is defined by the formula : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ( for an explanation of the summation operator , see summation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for example , consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm : 2500 , 2700 , 2400 , 2300 , 2550 , 2650 , 2750 , 2450 , 2600 , 2400 . the arithmetic mean is uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if the data set is a statistical population ( that is , consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them ) , then the mean of that population is called the population mean , and denoted by the greek letter mu . if the data set is a statistical sample ( a subset of the population ) , then we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean ( which for a data set x is denoted as overlinex ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the arithmetic mean can be similarly defined for vectors in multiple dimension , not only scalar values ; this is often referred to as a centroid . more generally , because the arithmetic mean is a convex combination ( coefficients sum to 1 ) , it can be defined on a convex space , not only a vector space . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful , especially as a measure of central tendency . these include : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median . the median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than , and no more than half are smaller than , the median . if elements in the data increase arithmetically , when placed in some order , then the median and arithmetic average are equal . for example , consider the data sample 12 , 34 . the average is 2 , as is the median . however , when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically , such as 12 , 48 , 16 , the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly . in this case , the arithmetic average is 6 , while the median is 4 . in general , the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample , and can be larger or smaller than most of them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are applications of this phenomenon in many fields . for example , since the 1980s , the median income in the united states has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a weighted average , or weighted mean , is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others , in that they are given more weight in the calculation . for example , the arithmetic mean of 3 and 5 is frac ( 35 ) 2 4 , or equivalently left ( frac12 cdot 3right ) left ( frac12 cdot 5right ) 4 . in contrast , a weighted mean in which the first number receives , for example , twice as much weight as the second ( perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled ) would be calculated as left ( frac23 cdot 3right ) left ( frac13 cdot 5right ) frac113 . here the weights , which necessarily sum to the value one , are ( 2 / 3 ) and ( 1 / 3 ) , the former being twice the latter . the arithmetic mean ( sometimes called the " unweighted average " or " equally weighted average " ) can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other ( equal to frac12 in the above example , and equal to frac1n in a situation with n numbers being averaged ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if a numerical property , and any sample of data from it , could take on any value from a continuous range , instead of , for example , just integers , then the probability of a number falling into some range of possible values can be described by integrating a continuous probability distribution across this range , even when the naive probability for a sample number taking one certain value from infinitely many is zero . the analog of a weighted average in this context , in which there are an infinite number of possibilities for the precise value of the variable in each range , is called the mean of the probability distribution . a most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal distribution ; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency , including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode ( the threems ) , are equal to each other . this equality does not hold for other probability distributions , as illustrated for the log - normal distribution here . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break particular care must be taken when using cyclic data , such as phases or angles . naively taking the arithmetic mean of 1° and 359° yields a result of 180° . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this is incorrect for two reasons : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in general application , such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range . a solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation ( viz . define the mean as the central point : the point about which one has the lowest dispersion ) , and redefine the difference as a modular distance ( that is , the distance on the circle : so the modular distance between 1° and 359° is 2° , not 358° ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the arithmetic mean is often denoted by a bar , ( a . . a vinculum or macron ) , for example as in barx ( read x bar ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some software ( text processors , web browsers ) may not display the x̄ symbol properly . for example , the x̄ symbol in html is actually a combination of two codes - the base letter x plus a code for the line above ( amp ;

*********** Article 35: American Football Conference ***********

the american football conference ( afc ) is one of the two conferences of the national football league ( nfl ) , the highest professional level of american football in the united states . this conference currently contains 16 teams organized into 4 divisions , as does its counterpart , the national football conference ( nfc ) . both conferences were created as part of the 1970 merger between the national football league , and the american football league ( afl ) . all ten of the afl teams , and three nfl teams , became members of the new afc , with the remaining thirteen nfl teams forming the nfc . a series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger , thus making the current total of 16 teams in each conference . the current afc champions are the cincinnati bengals , who defeated the kansas city chiefs in the 2022 afc championship game for their third conference championship , and their first since 1988 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break like the nfc , the conference has 16 teams organized into four divisions each with four teams : east , north , south and west . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this chart of the 2021 season standings displays an application of the nfl scheduling formula . the bengals in 2021 ( highlighted in green ) finished in first place in the afc north . thus , in 2021 , the bengals are scheduled to play two games against each of its division rivals ( highlighted in light blue ) , one game against each team in the afc east and nfc south ( highlighted in yellow ) , and one game each against the first - place finishers in the afc south , afc west ( highlighted in orange ) , and nfc east ( highlighted in pink ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break currently , the fourteen opponents each team faces over the 17 - game regular season schedule are set using a pre - determined formula : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break each afc team plays the other teams in their respective division twice ( home and away ) during the regular season , in addition to eleven other games assigned to their schedule by the nfl : three games are assigned on the basis of a particular teams final divisional standing from the previous season , and the remaining eight games are split between the roster of two other nfl divisions . this assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle . using the 2021 regular season schedule as an example , each team in the afc west plays against every team in the afc north and nfc east . in this way , non - divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the three games assigned based on the teams prior - season divisional standing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the end of each season , the four division winners and three wild cards ( non - division winners with best regular season record ) in the afc qualify for the playoffs . the afc playoffs culminate in the afc championship game , with the winner receiving the lamar hunt trophy . the afc champion then plays the nfc champion in the super bowl . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break both the afc and the nfc were created after the nfl merged with the american football league ( afl ) in 1970 . the afl began play in 1960 with eight teams , and added two more expansion clubs ( the miami dolphins in 1966 and the cincinnati bengals in 1968 ) before the merger . in order to equalize the number of teams in each conference , three nfl teams that predated the afls launch ( the cleveland browns , pittsburgh steelers , and the then - baltimore colts ) joined the ten former afl teams to form the afc . the two afl divisions afl east and afl west were more or less intact , while the nfls century division , in which the browns and the steelers had played since 1967 , was moved from the nfl to become the new afc central . upon the completion of the merger of the afl and nfl in 1970 , the newly minted american football conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the 1970 season ; the national football conference , however , could not agree upon their setup , and one was chosen from a fishbowl on january 16 , 1970 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since the merger , five expansion teams have joined the afc and two have left , thus making the current total 16 . when the seattle seahawks and the tampa bay buccaneers joined the league in 1976 , they were temporarily placed in the nfc and afc respectively . this arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences . the seahawks eventually returned to the nfc as a result of the 2002 realignment . the expansion jacksonville jaguars joined the afc in 1995 . there have been five teams that have relocated at least once . in 1984 , the baltimore colts relocated to indianapolis . in 1995 , the cleveland browns had attempted to move to baltimore ; the resulting dispute between cleveland and the team led to modell establishing the baltimore ravens with the players and personnel from the browns , while the browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the nfl . the ravens were treated as an expansion team . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in california , the oakland raiders relocated to los angeles in 1982 , back to oakland in 1995 , and then to las vegas in 2020 , while the san diego chargers returned to los angeles in 2017 after 56 years in san diego . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the houston oilers moved to tennessee in 1997 , where they were renamed the tennessee oilers . the team would change its name again , two years later , to the tennessee titans . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the nfl would again expand in 2002 , adding the houston texans to the afc . with the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time , the divisional setup has remained static ever since . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break between 1995 and 2021 , the afc has sent only 9 of its 16 teams to the super bowl : new england patriots ( 10 times ) , denver broncos ( 4 times ) , pittsburgh steelers ( 4 times ) , baltimore ravens ( 2 times ) , indianapolis colts ( 2 times ) , kansas city chiefs ( 2 times ) , cincinnati bengals ( 1 time ) , las vegas raiders ( 1 time ) , tennessee titans ( 1 time ) . by contrast , the nfc has sent 13 of the 16 nfc teams during that same time frame with only the detroit lions , minnesota vikings , and washington commanders missing out on an appearance in the super bowl . 17 of the 19 afc champions from 2001 to 2019 have started one of just three quarterbacks - tom brady , peyton manning and ben roethlisberger - in the super bowl . the afc has started 7 quarterbacks in the last 20 super bowls , while the nfc has started 16 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the merged league created a new logo for the afc that took elements of the old afl logo , specifically the " a " and the six stars surrounding it . the afc logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009 . the 2010 nfl season introduced an updated afc logo , with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars ( leaving four representing the four divisions of the afc ) , and moving the stars inside the letter , similar to the nfc logo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nbc aired the afcs sunday afternoon and playoff games from 1970 through the 1997 season . from 1998 to 2013 , cbs was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the afc ; in those years , all interconference games in which the afc team was the visiting team were broadcast on either nbc or cbs . since 2014 , the cross - flex policy allows select afc games ( that involve them playing an nfc team at home or intraconference games ) to be moved from cbs to fox . since 1990 , select afc playoff games have been seen on abc or espn . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afc divisions uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afc division rivals uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afc east uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afc north uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afc south rivals uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afc west rivals uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afc interdivisional rivals uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afc television network uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 36: Animal Farm ***********

animal farm is a satirical allegorical novella by george orwell , first published in england on 17 august 1945 . the book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer , hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal , free , and happy . ultimately , the rebellion is betrayed , and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before , under the dictatorship of a pig named napoleon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to orwell , the fable reflects events leading up to the russian revolution of 1917 and then on into the stalinist era of the soviet union . orwell , a democratic socialist , was a critic of joseph stalin and hostile to moscow - directed stalinism , an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the may days conflicts between the poum and stalinist forces during the spanish civil war . in a letter to yvonne davet , orwell described animal farm as a satirical tale against stalin ( " un conte satirique contre staline " ) , and in his essay " why i write " ( 1946 ) , wrote that animal farm was the first book in which he tried , with full consciousness of what he was doing , " to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the original title was animal farm : a fairy story , but us publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946 , and only one of the translations during orwells lifetime , the telugu version , kept it . other titular variations include subtitles like " a satire " and " a contemporary satire " . orwell suggested the title union des républiques socialistes animales for the french translation , which abbreviates to ursa , the latin word for " bear " , a symbol of russia . it also played on the french name of the soviet union , union des républiques socialistes soviétiques . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break orwell wrote the book between november 1943 and february 1944 , when the united kingdom was in its wartime alliance with the soviet union against nazi germany , and the british intelligentsia held stalin in high esteem , a phenomenon orwell hated . the manuscript was initially rejected by a number of british and american publishers , including one of orwells own , victor gollancz , which delayed its publication . it became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the cold war . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break time magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best english - language novels ( 1923 to 2005 ) ; it also featured at number 31 on the modern library list of best 20th - century novels , and number 46 on the bbcs the big read poll . it won a retrospective hugo award in 1996 and is included in the great books of the western world selection . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the poorly run manor farm near willingdon , england , is ripened for rebellion from its animal populace by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer , mr . jones . one night , the exalted boar , old major , holds a conference , at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called " beasts of england " . when old major dies , two young pigs , snowball and napoleon , assume command and stage a revolt , driving mr . jones off the farm and renaming the property " animal farm " . they adopt the seven commandments of animalism , the most important of which is , " all animals are equal " . the decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn . snowball teaches the animals to read and write , while napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of animalism . to commemorate the start of animal farm , snowball raises a green flag with a white hoof and horn . food is plentiful , and the farm runs smoothly . the pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items , ostensibly for their personal health . following an unsuccessful attempt by mr . jones and his associates to retake the farm ( later dubbed the " battle of the cowshed " ) , snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a windmill . napoleon disputes this idea , and matters come to head , which culminate in napoleons dogs chasing snowball away and napoleon declaring himself supreme commander . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm , replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm . through a young porker named squealer , napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea , claiming that snowball was only trying to win animals to his side . the animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill . when the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm , napoleon and squealer persuade the animals that snowball is trying to sabotage their project , and begin to purge the farm of animals accused by napoleon of consorting with his old rival . when some animals recall the battle of the cowshed , napoleon ( who was nowhere to be found during the battle ) gradually smears snowball to the point of saying he is a collaborator of mr . jones , even dismissing the fact that snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle . " beasts of england " is replaced with " animal farm " , while an anthem glorifying napoleon , who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man ( " comrade napoleon " ) , is composed and sung . napoleon then conducts a second purge , during which many animals who are alleged to be helping snowball in plots are executed by napoleons dogs , which troubles the rest of the animals . despite their hardships , the animals are easily placated by napoleons retort that they are better off than they were under mr . jones , as well as by the sheeps continual bleating of " four legs good , two legs bad " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mr . frederick , a neighbouring farmer , attacks the farm , using blasting powder to blow up the restored windmill . although the animals win the battle , they do so at great cost , as many , including boxer the workhorse , are wounded . although he recovers from this , boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill ( being almost 12 years old at that point ) . he is taken away in a knackers van , and a donkey called benjamin alerts the animals of this , but squealer quickly waves off their alarm by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owners signboard had not been repainted . squealer subsequently reports boxers death and honours him with a festival the following day . ( however , napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of boxer to the knacker , allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break years pass , the windmill is rebuilt and another windmill is constructed , which makes the farm a good amount of income . however , the ideals that snowball discussed , including stalls with electric lighting , heating , and running water , are forgotten , with napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives . snowball has been forgotten , alongside boxer , with " the exception of the few who knew him " . many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old . mr . jones is also dead , saying he " died in an inebriates ' home in another part of the country " . the pigs start to resemble humans , as they walk upright , carry whips , drink alcohol , and wear clothes . the seven commandments are abridged to just one phrase : " all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others " . the maxim " four legs good , two legs bad " is similarly changed to " four legs good , two legs better " . other changes include the hoof and horn flag being replaced with a plain green banner and old majors skull , which was previously put on display , being reburied . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers , with whom he celebrates a new alliance . he abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name " the manor farm " . the men and pigs start playing cards , flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game . both napoleon and mr . pilkington , one of the farmers , play the ace of spades at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first . when the animals outside look at the pigs and men , they can no longer distinguish between the two . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break george orwells animal farm is an example of a political satire that was intended to have a " wider application " , according to orwell himself , in terms of its relevance . stylistically , the work shares many similarities with some of orwells other works , most notably nineteen eighty - four , as both have been considered works of swiftian satire . furthermore , these two prominent works seem to suggest orwells bleak view of the future for humanity ; he seems to stress the potential / current threat of dystopias similar to those in animal farm and nineteen eighty - four . in these kinds of works , orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of europe following the second world war . orwells style and writing philosophy as a whole were very concerned with the pursuit of truth in writing . orwell was committed to communicating in a way that was straightforward , given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse . for this reason , he is careful , in animal farm , to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion . the difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact , as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly , while the wicked animals on the farm , such as napoleon , twist language in such a way that it meets their own insidious desires . this style reflects orwells close proximation to the issues facing europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on stalins soviet russia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break george orwell wrote the manuscript between november 1943 and february 1944 after his experiences during the spanish civil war , which he described in homage to catalonia ( 1938 ) . in the preface of a 1947 ukrainian edition of animal farm , he explained how escaping the communist purges in spain taught him " how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries " . this motivated orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals . homage to catalonia sold poorly ; after seeing arthur koestlers best - selling , darkness at noon , about the moscow trials , orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break immediately prior to writing the book , orwell had quit the bbc . he was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the ministry of information had put out . the booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the soviet union , such as directions to claim that the red terror was a figment of nazi imagination . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the preface , orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1944 , the manuscript was almost lost when a german v - 1 flying bomb destroyed his london home . orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published , largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between britain , the united states , and the soviet union . four publishers refused to publish animal farm , yet one had initially accepted the work , but declined it after consulting the ministry of information . eventually , secker and warburg published the first edition in 1945 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the second world war , it became clear to orwell that anti - soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch – including his regular publisher gollancz . he also submitted the manuscript to faber and faber , where the poet eliot ( who was a director of the firm ) rejected it ; eliot wrote back to orwell praising the books " good writing " and " fundamental integrity " , but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint " which i take to be generally trotskyite " . eliot said he found the view " not convincing " , and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm ; he posited that someone might argue " what was needed was not more communism but more public - spirited pigs " . orwell let andré deutsch , who was working for nicholson watson in 1944 , read the typescript , and deutsch was convinced that nicholson watson would want to publish it ; however , they did not , and " lectured orwell on what they perceived to be errors in animal farm " . in his london letter on 17 april 1944 for partisan review , orwell wrote that it was " now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti - russian printed . anti - russian books do appear , but mostly from catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the publisher jonathan cape , who had initially accepted animal farm , subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him off – although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a soviet spy . writing to leonard moore , a partner in the literary agency of christy moore , publisher jonathan cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the ministry of information . such flagrant anti - soviet bias was unacceptable , and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive . it may reasonably be assumed that the " important official " was a man named peter smollett , who was later unmasked as a soviet agent . orwell was suspicious of smollett / smolka , and he would be one of the names orwell included in his list of crypto - communists and fellow - travellers sent to the information research department in 1949 . the publisher wrote to orwell , saying : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right , but the fable does follow , as i see now , so completely the progress of the russian soviets and their two dictators ' and ' , ' stalin ' , that it can apply only to russia , to the exclusion of the other dictatorships . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another thing : it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs . i think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people , and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy , as undoubtedly the russians are . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break frederic warburg also faced pressures against publication , even from people in his own office and from his wife pamela , who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards stalin and the red army , which had played a major part in defeating adolf hitler . a russian translation was printed in the paper posev , and in giving permission for a russian translation of animal farm , orwell refused in advance all royalties . a translation in ukrainian , which was produced in germany , was confiscated in large part by the american wartime authorities and handed over to the soviet repatriation commission . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in october 1945 , orwell wrote to frederic warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist david low might illustrate animal farm . low had written a letter saying that he had had " a good time with animal farm – an excellent bit of satire – it would illustrate perfectly " . nothing came of this , and a trial issue produced by secker warburg in 1956 illustrated by john driver was abandoned , but the folio society published an edition in 1984 illustrated by quentin blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist ralph steadman was published by secker warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of animal farm . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about british self - censorship and how the british people were suppressing criticism of the ussr , their world war ii ally : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although the first edition allowed space for the preface , it was not included , and as of june 2009 most editions of the book have not included it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break secker and warburg published the first edition of animal farm in 1945 without an introduction . however , the publisher had provided space for a preface in the authors proof composited from the manuscript . for reasons unknown , no preface was supplied , and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1972 , ian angus found the original typescript titled " the freedom of the press " , and bernard crick published it , together with his own introduction , in the times literary supplement on 15 september 1972 as " how the essay came to be written " . orwells essay criticised british self - censorship by the press , specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of stalin and the soviet government . the same essay also appeared in the italian 1976 edition of animal farm with another introduction by crick , claiming to be the first edition with the preface . other publishers were still declining to publish it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive . writing in the american new republic magazine , george soule expressed his disappointment in the book , writing that it " puzzled and saddened me . it seemed on the whole dull . the allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly " . soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real - world inspirations , and said , " it seems to me that the failure of this book ( commercially it is already assured of tremendous success ) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced , but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the guardian on 24 august 1945 called animal farm " a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few " . tosco fyvel , writing in tribune on the same day , called the book " a gentle satire on a certain state and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us " . julian symons responded , on 7 september , " should we not expect , in tribune at least , acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular state – soviet russia ? it seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify napoleon with stalin , and snowball with trotsky , and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author , upon a political ground . in a hundred years time perhaps , animal farm may be simply a fairy story ; today it is a political satire with a good deal of point " . animal farm has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the cia , from 1952 to 1957 in operation aedinosaur , sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into poland , hungary and czechoslovakia , whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break time magazine chose animal farm as one of the 100 best english - language novels ( 1923 to 2005 ) ; it also featured at number 31 on the modern library list of best 20th - century novels . it won a retrospective hugo award in 1996 and is included in the great books of the western world selection . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break popular reading in schools , animal farm was ranked the uks favourite book from school in a 2016 poll . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break animal farm has also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the us . the following are examples of this controversy that has existed around orwells work : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break animal farm has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries . the ala also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the international book fair in moscow , russia , in 1977 and banned from schools in the united arab emirates for references to practices or actions that defy arab or islamic beliefs , such as pigs or alcohol . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the same manner , animal farm has also faced relatively recent issues in china . in 2018 , the government made the decision to censor all online posts about or referring to animal farm . however the book itself , as of 2019 , remains sold in stores . amy hawkins and jeffrey wasserstrom of the atlantic stated in 2019 that the book is widely available in mainland china for several reasons : censors believe the general public is unlikely to read a highbrow book , because the elites who do read books feel connected to the ruling party anyway , and because the communist party sees being too aggressive in blocking cultural products as a liability . the authors stated " it was – and remains – as easy to buy 1984 and animal farm in shenzhen or shanghai as it is in london or los angeles " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an enhanced version of the book , launched in india in 2017 , was widely praised for capturing the authors intent , by republishing the proposed preface of the first edition and the preface he wrote for the ukrainian edition . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the pigs snowball , napoleon , and squealer adapt old majors ideas into " a complete system of thought " , which they formally name animalism , an allegoric reference to communism , not to be confused with the philosophy animalism . soon after , napoleon and squealer partake in activities associated with the humans ( drinking alcohol , sleeping in beds , trading ) , which were explicitly prohibited by the seven commandments . squealer is employed to alter the seven commandments to account for this humanisation , an allusion to the soviet governments revising of history in order to exercise control of the peoples beliefs about themselves and their society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the original commandments are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break these commandments are also distilled into the maxim " four legs good , two legs bad ! " which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm , often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of animalism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break later , napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law - breaking . the changed commandments are as follows , with the changes bolded : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break eventually , these are replaced with the maxims , " all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others " , and " four legs good , two legs better " as the pigs become more human . this is an ironic twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments , which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans ' evil habits . through the revision of the commandments , orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break orwell biographer jeffrey meyers has written , " virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory " . orwell himself wrote in 1946 , " of course i intended it primarily as a satire on the russian revolution and that kind of revolution ( violent conspiratorial revolution , led by unconsciously power - hungry people ) can only lead to a change of masters– revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert " . in a preface for a 1947 ukrainian edition , he stated , " for the past ten years i have been convinced that the destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement . on my return from spain ' 1937 ' i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the revolt of the animals against farmer jones is orwells analogy with the october 1917 bolshevik revolution . the battle of the cowshed has been said to represent the allied invasion of soviet russia in 1918 , and the defeat of the white russians in the russian civil war . the pigs ' rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of a stalinist bureaucracy in the ussr , just as napoleons emergence as the farms sole leader reflects stalins emergence . the pigs ' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use , " the turning point of the story " as orwell termed it in a letter to dwight macdonald , stands as an analogy for the crushing of the left - wing 1921 kronstadt revolt against the bolsheviks , and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various five year plans . the puppies controlled by napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the stalinist structure , and the pigs ' treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the 1930s . in chapter seven , when the animals confess their non - existent crimes and are killed , orwell directly alludes to the purges , confessions and show trials of the late 1930s . these contributed to orwells conviction that the bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the soviet system become rotten . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break peter edgerly firchow and peter davison contend that the battle of the windmill , specifically referencing the battle of stalingrad and the battle of moscow , represents world war ii . during the battle , orwell first wrote , " all the animals , including napoleon " took cover . orwell had the publisher alter this to " all the animals except napoleon " in recognition of stalins decision to remain in moscow during the german advance . orwell requested the change after he met józef czapski in paris in march 1945 . czapski , a survivor of the katyn massacre and an opponent of the soviet regime , told orwell , as orwell wrote to arthur koestler , that it had been " the character and greatness of stalin " that saved russia from the german invasion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other connections that writers have suggested illustrate orwells telescoping of russian history from 1917 to 1943 include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion , which stands for the abortive revolutions in hungary and in germany ( ch . iv ) ; the conflict between napoleon and snowball ( ch . v ) , parallelling " the two rival and quasi - messianic beliefs that seemed pitted against one another : trotskyism , with its faith in the revolutionary vocation of the proletariat of the west ; and stalinism with its glorification of russias socialist destiny " ; napoleons dealings with whymper and the willingdon markets ( ch . vi ) , paralleling the treaty of rapallo ; and fredericks forged bank notes , parallelling the hitler - stalin pact of august 1939 , after which frederick attacks animal farm without warning and destroys the windmill . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the books close , with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement , reflected orwells view of the 1943 tehran conference that seemed to display the establishment of " the best possible relations between the ussr and the west " – but in reality were destined , as orwell presciently predicted , to continue to unravel . the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pilkington , both suspicious , each " played an ace of spades simultaneously " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break similarly , the music in the novel , starting with " beasts of england " and the later anthems , parallels " the internationale " and its adoption and repudiation by the soviet authorities as the anthem of the ussr in the 1920s and 1930s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break marxist critic averred in a 2022 lecture that animal farm is actually " a deeply reactionary book , displaying aristocratic condescension against the people , a book in which the working class appear as imbeciles . " manoe points that almost all of the animals ( except for the pigs , representing the bolshevik intellectual elite ) are invariably represented as inherently and profoundly stupid and lacking in agency . education efforts are to no avail , as most animals are too stupid to even learn the alphabet . they understand how to vote but not how to put forth arguments of their own , or even to understand those put forward by the elite pigs , and not one leader arises from the docile mass to make a fight against the betrayal of the revolution . instead , all battling is within factions of the intellectual elite ; and indeed even the bourgeoisie , represented by the humans , are much smarter and more capable than the workers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2021 , the national youth theatre toured a stage version of animal farm . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a solo version , adapted and performed by guy masterson , premièred at the traverse theatre edinburgh in january 1995 and has toured worldwide since . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a theatrical version , with music by richard peaslee and lyrics by adrian mitchell , was staged at the national theatre london on 25 april 1984 , directed by peter hall . it toured nine cities in 1985 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a new adaptation written and directed by robert icke , designed by bunny christie with puppetry designed and directed by toby olié opened at the birmingham repertory theatre in january 2022 before touring the uk . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break animal farm has been adapted to film twice . both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties , including sanitising some aspects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break andy serkis is directing an upcoming animated film adaptation with matt reeves producing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a bbc radio version , produced by rayner heppenstall , was broadcast in january 1947 . orwell listened to the production at his home in canonbury square , london , with hugh gordon porteous , amongst others . orwell later wrote to heppenstall that porteous , " who had not read the book , grasped what was happening after a few minutes " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a further radio production , again using orwells own dramatisation of the book , was broadcast in january 2013 on bbc radio 4 . tamsin greig narrated , and the cast included nicky henson as napoleon , toby jones as the propagandist squealer , and ralph ineson as boxer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1950 , norman pett and his writing partner don freeman were secretly hired by the information research department ( ird ) , a secret wing of the british foreign office , to adapt animal farm into a comic strip . this comic was not published in the uk but ran in brazilian and burmese newspapers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 37: Amphibian ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amphibians are ectothermic , tetrapod vertebrates of the class amphibia . all living amphibians belong to the group lissamphibia . they inhabit a wide variety of habitats , with most species living within terrestrial , fossorial , arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water , but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air - breathing form with lungs . amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin . they are superficially similar to reptiles like lizards but , along with mammals and birds , reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed . with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins , amphibians are often ecological indicators ; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earliest amphibians evolved in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony - limbed fins , features that were helpful in adapting to dry land . they diversified and became dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods , but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates . over time , amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity , leaving only the modern subclass lissamphibia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the three modern orders of amphibians are anura ( the frogs ) , urodela ( the salamanders ) , and apoda ( the caecilians ) . the number of known amphibian species is approximately 8000 , of which nearly 90 are frogs . the smallest amphibian ( and vertebrate ) in the world is a frog from new guinea ( paedophryne amauensis ) with a length of just 7 mm . the largest living amphibian is the 1 m south china giant salamander ( andrias sligoi ) , but this is dwarfed by the extinct 9 m prionosuchus from the middle permian of brazil . the study of amphibians is called batrachology , while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term ἀμφίβιος ( amphíbios ) , which means ' both kinds of life ' , ἀμφί meaning ' of both kinds ' and βιος meaning ' life ' . the term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water , including seals and otters . traditionally , the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes . amphibia in its widest sense ( sensu lato ) was divided into three subclasses , two of which are extinct : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed . the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb , university of california , berkeley and the classification by herpetologist darrel frost and the american museum of natural history , available as the online reference database " amphibian species of the world " . the numbers of species cited above follows frost and the total number of known amphibian species as of march 31 , 2019 is exactly 8000 , of which nearly 90 are frogs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the phylogenetic classification , the taxon labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics . classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem - based or a node - based classification . traditionally , amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage , while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians ( frogs , salamanders and caecilians ) and all their descendants is called lissamphibia . the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain , and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups , like the temnospondyli ( traditionally placed in the subclass labyrinthodontia ) or the lepospondyli , and in some analyses even in the amniotes . this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal devonian and carboniferous amphibian - type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy , and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy . if the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia , it becomes a paraphyletic group . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia , which is usually considered a clade , a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor . the three modern orders are anura ( the frogs ) , caudata ( or urodela , the salamanders ) , and gymnophiona ( or apoda , the caecilians ) . it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a temnospondyl - like ancestor , and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorph amphibians , and thus of amniotes . the oldest known caecilian is another early jurassic species , eocaecilia micropodia , also from arizona . the earliest salamander is beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the late jurassic of northeastern china . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break authorities disagree as to whether salientia is a superorder that includes the order anura , or whether anura is a sub - order of the order salientia . the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three orders , but an extinct salamander - like family , the albanerpetontidae , is now considered part of lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia . furthermore , salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic proto - frog , triadobatrachus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bottom : restoration of tiktaalik , an advanced tetrapodomorph fish uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period , around 370 million years ago , from lobe - finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish . these ancient lobe - finned fish had evolved multi - jointed leg - like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom . some fish had developed primitive lungs that help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen . they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required . eventually , their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods , including modern amphibians , reptiles , birds , and mammals . despite being able to crawl on land , many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water . they had started to develop lungs , but still breathed predominantly with gills . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many examples of species showing transitional features have been discovered . ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians , with nostrils and more efficient lungs . it had four sturdy limbs , a neck , a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the lobe - finned fish , eusthenopteron . an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the multi - folded structure of the teeth and the paired supra - occipital bones at the back of the head , neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the end of the devonian period ( 360 million years ago ) , the seas , rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates , in the early carboniferous ( 360 to 345 million years ago ) , the climate became wet and warm . extensive swamps developed with mosses , ferns , horsetails and calamites . air - breathing arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivorous amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment . there were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain , occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile . though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air , most still had a long tapering body and strong tail . they were the top land predators , sometimes reaching several metres in length , preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water . they still needed to return to water to lay their shell - less eggs , and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors . it was the development of the amniotic egg , which prevents the developing embryo from drying out , that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance in the period that followed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles , and amphibians were further devastated by the permian–triassic extinction event . during the triassic period ( 250 to 200 million years ago ) , the reptiles continued to out - compete the amphibians , leading to a reduction in both the amphibians ' size and their importance in the biosphere . according to the fossil record , lissamphibia , which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage , may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic . the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate . a 2005 molecular phylogeny , based on rdna analysis , suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs . it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic ( around 250 million years ago ) , before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the lobe - finned fish . the briefness of this period , and the swiftness with which radiation took place , would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils . there are large gaps in the fossil record , but the discovery of a gerobatrachus hottoni from the early permian in texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs . molecular analysis suggests that the frog–salamander divergence took place considerably earlier than the palaeontological evidence indicates . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as they evolved from lunged fish , amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land , including the need to develop new means of locomotion . in the water , the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward , but on land , quite different mechanisms were required . their vertebral columns , limbs , limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding . terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air . they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature . they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment . their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water . the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs . reptiles , birds and mammals are amniotes , the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes , some of which are impervious . lacking these membranes , amphibians require water bodies for reproduction , although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage . they are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove swamps ; the andersons salamander meanwhile occurs in brackish or salt water lakes . on land , amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break modern amphibians have a simplified anatomy compared to their ancestors due to paedomorphosis , caused by two evolutionary trends : miniaturization and an unusually large genome , which result in a slower growth and development rate compared to other vertebrates . another reason for their size is associated with their rapid metamorphosis , which seems to have evolved only in the ancestors of lissamphibia ; in all other known lines the development was much more gradual . because a remodeling of the feeding apparatus means they dont eat during the metamorphosis , the metamorphosis has to go faster the smaller the individual is , so it happens at an early stage when the larvae are still small . ( the largest species of salamanders dont go through a metamorphosis . amphibians that lay eggs on land often go through the whole metamorphosis inside the egg . an anamniotic terrestrial egg is less than 1cm in diameter due to diffusion problems , a size which puts a limit on the amount of posthatching growth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the smallest amphibian ( and vertebrate ) in the world is a microhylid frog from new guinea ( paedophryne amauensis ) first discovered in 2012 . it has an average length of 7 mm and is part of a genus that contains four of the worlds ten smallest frog species . the largest living amphibian is the 1 m chinese giant salamander ( andrias davidianus ) but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever existed—the extinct 9 m prionosuchus , a crocodile - like temnospondyl dating to 270 million years ago from the middle permian of brazil . the largest frog is the african goliath frog ( conraua goliath ) , which can reach 32 cm and weigh 3 kg . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amphibians are ectothermic ( cold - blooded ) vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes . their metabolic rate is low and as a result , their food and energy requirements are limited . in the adult state , they have tear ducts and movable eyelids , and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations . they have muscular tongues , which in many species can be protruded . modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with articular processes . their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae . their skulls are mostly broad and short , and are often incompletely ossified . their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales , apart from a few fish - like scales in certain caecilians . the skin contains many mucous glands and in some species , poison glands ( a type of granular gland ) . the hearts of amphibians have three chambers , two atria and one ventricle . they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea . most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults . amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils . these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat . they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the order anura ( from the ancient greek a ( n ) - meaning " without " and oura meaning " tail " ) comprises the frogs and toads . they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them , shorter forelimbs , webbed toes with no claws , no tails , large eyes and glandular moist skin . members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs , while those with warty skins are known as toads . the difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule . members of the family bufonidae are known as the " true toads " . frogs range in size from the 30 cm goliath frog ( conraua goliath ) of west africa to the 7 mm paedophryne amauensis , first described in papua new guinea in 2012 , which is also the smallest known vertebrate . although most species are associated with water and damp habitats , some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts . they are found worldwide except for polar areas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community , but the relationships between some families remain unclear . future molecular studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships . the suborder archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs . these are ascaphidae , bombinatoridae , discoglossidae and leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages . the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia are the fossorial megophryidae , pelobatidae , pelodytidae , scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae . these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the order caudata ( from the latin cauda meaning " tail " ) consists of the salamanders—elongated , low - slung animals that mostly resemble lizards in form . this is a symplesiomorphic trait and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals . salamanders lack claws , have scale - free skins , either smooth or covered with tubercles , and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned . they range in size from the chinese giant salamander ( andrias davidianus ) , which has been reported to grow to a length of 1 m , to the diminutive thorius pennatulus from mexico which seldom exceeds 20 mm in length . salamanders have a mostly laurasian distribution , being present in much of the holarctic region of the northern hemisphere . the family plethodontidae is also found in central america and south america north of the amazon basin ; urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant species of salamanders . members of several salamander families have become paedomorphic and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults . most salamanders are under 15 cm long . they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat . when on land , they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation , emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms , insects and other invertebrates . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the suborder cryptobranchoidea contains the primitive salamanders . a number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found , but there are only three living species , the chinese giant salamander ( andrias davidianus ) , the japanese giant salamander ( andrias japonicus ) and the hellbender ( cryptobranchus alleganiensis ) from north america . these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state ; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded . a unique feature is their ability to feed by suction , depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right . the males excavate nests , persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them , and guard them . as well as breathing with lungs , they respire through the many folds in their thin skin , which has capillaries close to the surface . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders . they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused prearticular bones in the lower jaw , and by using internal fertilisation . in salamandrids , the male deposits a bundle of sperm , the spermatophore , and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid . the largest family in this group is plethodontidae , the lungless salamanders , which includes 60 of all salamander species . the family salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name " newt " is given to members of its subfamily pleurodelinae . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the third suborder , sirenoidea , contains the four species of sirens , which are in a single family , sirenidae . members of this order are eel - like aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs . some of their features are primitive while others are derived . fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage . despite this , the eggs are laid singly , a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the order gymnophiona ( from the greek gymnos meaning " naked " and ophis meaning " serpent " ) or apoda comprises the caecilians . these are long , cylindrical , limbless animals with a snake - or worm - like form . the adults vary in length from 8 to 75 centimetres ( 3 to 30 inches ) with the exception of thomsons caecilian ( caecilia thompsoni ) , which can reach 150 cm . a caecilians skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales . it has rudimentary eyes covered in skin , which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity . it also has a pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have tactile and olfactory functions . most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil , in rotten wood and under plant debris , but some are aquatic . most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch , they make their way to adjacent bodies of water . others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch . a few species give birth to live young , nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct . caecilians have a mostly gondwanan distribution , being found in tropical regions of africa , asia and central and south america . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the integumentary structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates , such as the presence of highly cornified outer layers , renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary and thyroid glands . local thickenings ( often called warts ) are common , such as those found on toads . the outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece , in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes . amphibians often eat the sloughed skin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break - - gt ; olist list - style - typeupper - alpha uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amphibian skin is permeable to water . gas exchange can take place through the skin ( cutaneous respiration ) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds . the main poison - producing glands , the parotoids , produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads , along the backs of frogs , behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores . these three cell layers consist of the melanophores ( occupying the deepest layer ) , the guanophores ( forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules , producing a blue - green colour ) and the lipophores ( yellow , the most superficial layer ) . the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland . unlike bony fish , there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system , and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish . a vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homologous to other tetrapods , though with a number of variations . they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs . the bones are hollow and lightweight . the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body . the bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes . the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle , and the well - developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs . the ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in most amphibians , there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot , but no claws on either . some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are eel - like in appearance with tiny , stubby legs . the sirens are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs . the caecilians are limbless . they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body . on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in frogs , the hind legs are larger than the fore legs , especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming . in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large , and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies . the feet have adaptations for the way of life , with webbing between the toes for swimming , broad adhesive toe pads for climbing , and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging ( frogs usually dig backwards into the soil ) . in most salamanders , the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body . locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop , particularly when climbing . in their normal gait , only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors , the lobe - finned fish . some salamanders in the genus aneides and certain plethodontids climb trees and have long limbs , large toepads and prehensile tails . in aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles , the tail has dorsal and ventral fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion . adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as autotomy . certain species in the plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily . the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape . both tails and limbs can be regenerated . adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break - - gt ; olist uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage , and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct . in the juvenile ( or tadpole ) stage , the circulation is similar to that of a fish ; the two - chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated , and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop . in the adult stage , amphibians ( especially frogs ) lose their gills and develop lungs . they have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria . when the ventricle starts contracting , deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs . continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body . mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates , with a central brain , a spinal cord , and nerves throughout the body . the amphibian brain is relatively simple but broadly the same structurally as in reptiles , birds and mammals . their brains are enlongated , expect in caecilians , and contain the usual motor and sensory areas of tretrapods . the pineal body , known to regulate sleep patterns in humans , is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes , but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians . some caecilians possess electroreceptors that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water . the ears are well developed in frogs . there is no external ear , but the large circular eardrum lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye . this vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone , the stapes , to the inner ear . only high - frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way , but low - frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism . there is a patch of specialized haircells , called papilla amphibiorum , in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds . another feature , unique to frogs and salamanders , is the columella - operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals . the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the eyes of tadpoles lack lids , but at metamorphosis , the cornea becomes more dome - shaped , the lens becomes flatter , and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop . the adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes . they allow colour vision and depth of focus . in the retinas are green rods , which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break - - gt ; olist uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws . some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey , repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia . most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs . the short oesophagus is lined with cilia that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage . the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amphibians possess a pancreas , liver and gall bladder . the liver is usually large with two lobes . its size is determined by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit , and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up . adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen ( in internal structures called fat bodies ) , under the skin and , in some salamanders , in the tail . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are two kidneys located dorsally , near the roof of the body cavity . their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent . larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine , while terrestrial species , with a greater need to conserve water , excrete the less toxic product urea . some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes , possessing few internal septa and large alveoli , and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood . ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping . most amphibians , however , are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin . to enable sufficient cutaneous respiration , the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate . because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates , aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration , as in the titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander . in air , where oxygen is more concentrated , some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange , most famously the plethodontid salamanders , which have neither lungs nor gills . many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage , with some ( such as the axolotl ) retaining gills as aquatic adults . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for the purpose of reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist . a few ( for example fejervarya raja ) can inhabit brackish water , but there are no true marine amphibians . there are reports , however , of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters . such was the case with the black sea invasion of the natural hybrid pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations ( for example , eleutherodactylus , the pacific platymantis , the australo - papuan microhylids , and many other tropical frogs ) , however , do not need any water for breeding in the wild . they reproduce via direct development , an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free - standing water . almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical rainforests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult , passing through the tadpole stage within the egg . reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall , but the seasonal timing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the tropics , many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year . in temperate regions , breeding is mostly seasonal , usually in the spring , and is triggered by increasing day length , rising temperatures or rainfall . experiments have shown the importance of temperature , but the trigger event , especially in arid regions , is often a storm . in anurans , males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in caecilians , fertilisation is internal , the male extruding an intromittent organ , the , and inserting it into the female cloaca . the paired müllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm . fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation . in most of these , the male deposits a spermatophore , a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone , on the substrate either on land or in the water . the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent . the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later . courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species . in some , the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others , the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus . certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae , hynobiidae and cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs , with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with a few exceptions , frogs use external fertilisation . the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs , or in the case of epipedobates tricolor , around the neck . they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm . roughened nuptial pads on the males hands aid in retaining grip . often the male collects and retains the egg mass , forming a sort of basket with the hind feet . an exception is the granular poison frog ( oophaga granulifera ) where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously . the tailed frog ( ascaphus truei ) exhibits internal fertilisation . the " tail " is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female . this frog lives in fast - flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs . the sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders . typically , prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site , the males usually arriving first , calling and setting up territories . other satellite males remain quietly nearby , waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory . the females arrive sporadically , mate selection takes place and eggs are laid . the females depart and territories may change hands . more females appear and in due course , the breeding season comes to an end . explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall . these frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site . they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place , perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season . the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues , the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there is a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts , with elaborate courtship displays to keep the females attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mate with . some species store sperm through long breeding seasons , as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most amphibians go through metamorphosis , a process of significant morphological change after birth . in typical amphibian development , eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle . frogs , toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills . metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood , which stimulates metamorphosis , and prolactin , which counteracts thyroxines effect . specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break - - gt ; olist uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the egg , the embryo is suspended in perivitelline fluid and surrounded by semi - permeable gelatinous capsules , with the yolk mass providing nutrients . as the larvae hatch , the capules are dissolved by enzymes secreted from gland at the tip of the snout . in the wood frog ( rana sylvatica ) , the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to 6 c - change warmer than its surroundings , which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the eggs may be deposited singly , in cluster or in long strands . sites for laying eggs include water , mud , burrows , debris and on plants or under logs or stones . the greenhouse frog ( eleutherodactylus planirostris ) lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage . the tungara frog ( physalaemus pustulosus ) builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs . first a raft is built , then eggs are laid in the centre , and finally a foam cap is overlaid . the foam has anti - microbial properties . it contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free - living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults . in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders ( plethodontidae ) , direct development takes place , the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults . many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land , and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies . some caecilians , the alpine salamander ( salamandra atra ) and some of the african live - bearing toads ( nectophrynoides spp . are viviparous . their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the females oviduct , often for long periods . other amphibians , but not caecilians , are ovoviviparous . the eggs are retained in or on the parents body , but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult . the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth , either before or after metamorphosis , according to their species . the toad genus nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members . amphibian larvae are known as tadpoles . they have thick , rounded bodies with powerful muscular tails . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unlike in other amphibians , frog tadpoles do not resemble adults . the free - living larvae are normally fully aquatic , but the tadpoles of some species ( such as nannophrys ceylonensis ) are semi - terrestrial and live among wet rocks . tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons , gills for respiration ( external gills at first , internal gills later ) , lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming . newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills . the lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs , the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air . some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs . these larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place . while tadpoles do not have true teeth , in most species , the jaws have long , parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak . front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break iodine and t4 ( over stimulate the spectacular apoptosis ' cell ' , ' death ' of the cells of the larval gills , tail and fins ) also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic , vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial , carnivorous frog with better neurological , visuospatial , olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in fact , tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically herbivorous . pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies , large caudal fins and small mouths ; they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation . stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths , shallow bodies and caudal fins ; they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria . some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage , eating insects , smaller tadpoles and fish . young of the cuban tree frog ( osteopilus septentrionalis ) can occasionally be cannibalistic , the younger tadpoles attacking a larger , more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at metamorphosis , rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely . the spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut . the animal develops a large jaw , and its gills disappear along with its gill sac . eyes and legs grow quickly , and a tongue is formed . there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system . all this can happen in about a day . a few days later , the tail is reabsorbed , due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at hatching , a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids , teeth in both upper and lower jaws , three pairs of feathery external gills , and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins . the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond - living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water . pond - type larvae often have a pair of balancers , rod - like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment . both of these are able to breed . some have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form , a condition known as neoteny . as well as lack of food . there are fifteen species of obligate neotenic salamanders , including species of necturus , proteus and amphiuma , and many examples of facultative ones , such as the northwestern salamander ( ambystoma gracile ) and the tiger salamander ( a . tigrinum ) that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter . each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg , emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander . the female salamander often broods the eggs . in the genus ensatinas , the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them , effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in newts and salamanders , metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs . this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems their lungs are functional early , but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles . their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water . other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins , the closure of gill slits , thickening of the skin , the development of eyelids , and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure . salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land . adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer , and a land phase in winter . for adaptation to a water phase , prolactin is the required hormone , and for adaptation to the land phase , thyroxine . external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water . the development of the young of ichthyophis glutinosus , a species from sri lanka , has been much studied . the eel - like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water . they have three pairs of external red feathery gills , a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes , a lateral line system and a short tail with fins . they swim by undulating their body from side to side . they are mostly active at night , soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land . metamorphosis is gradual . by the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes , lateral line systems and tails . the skin thickens , embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments . by this time , the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the majority of species of caecilians , the young are produced by viviparity . typhlonectes compressicauda , a species from south america , is typical of these . up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time . they are elongated and have paired sac - like gills , small eyes and specialised scraping teeth . at first , they feed on the yolks of the eggs , but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct . this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall . they may increase their length sixfold and be two - fifths as long as their mother before being born . by this time they have undergone metamorphosis , lost their eyes and gills , developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles , and reabsorbed their teeth . a permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ringed caecilian ( siphonops annulatus ) has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction . the progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy . the brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate . meanwhile , they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but , in general , the larger the number of eggs in a batch , the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place . nevertheless , it is estimated that in up to 20 of amphibian species , one or both adults play some role in the care of the young . those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land . the black mountain salamander ( desmognathus welteri ) does this , the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs . when fully developed , they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders . the male hellbender , a primitive salamander , excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there . the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch , using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the male colostethus subpunctatus , a tiny frog , protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log . when the eggs hatch , the male transports the tadpoles on his back , stuck there by a mucous secretion , to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off . the male midwife toad ( alytes obstetricans ) winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks . he keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch , he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles . the female gastric - brooding frog ( rheobatrachus spp . reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or hatchlings ; however , this stage was never observed before the species became extinct . the tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply . the pouched frog ( assa darlingtoni ) lays eggs on the ground . when they hatch , the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs . the aquatic surinam toad ( pipa pipa ) raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis . the granular poison frog ( oophaga granulifera ) is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family dendrobatidae . its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch , the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable water - filled crevice such as the axil of a leaf or the rosette of a bromeliad . the female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amphibians are notable among vertebrates for their diversity of chromosomes and genomes . the karyotypes ( chromosomes ) have been determined for at least 1193 ( 14 ) of the 8200 known ( diploid ) species , including 963 anurans , 209 salamanders , and 21 caecilians . generally , the karyotypes of diploid amphibians are characterized by 20–26 bi - armed chromosomes . amphibians have also very large genomes compared to other taxa of vertebrates and corresponding variation in genome size ( c - value : picograms of dna in haploid nuclei ) . the genome sizes range from 0 to 11 pg in frogs , from 13 to 120 pg in salamanders , and from 2 to 11 pg in caecilians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the large genome sizes have prevented whole - genome sequencing of amphibians although a number of genomes have been published recently . the 1gb draft genome of xenopus tropicalis was the first to be reported for amphibians in 2010 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with a few exceptions , adult amphibians are predators , feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow . the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles , caterpillars , earthworms and spiders . the sirens ( siren spp . often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a brazilian tree frog ( xenohyla truncata ) includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet . the mexican burrowing toad ( rhinophrynus dorsalis ) has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites . it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first , their tongues being hinged at the front . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break food is mostly selected by sight , even in conditions of dim light . movement of the prey triggers a feeding response . frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and green frogs ( rana clamitans ) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past . toads , salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey . this response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves . cave - dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell . some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell , even in complete darkness . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it . they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth , a feature unique to amphibians . the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals . salamanders , caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws , but some frogs ( rana spp . lack teeth in the lower jaw , and toads ( bufo spp . have no teeth . in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the tiger salamander ( ambystoma tigrinum ) is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates . others amphibians , such as the bufo spp . toads , actively search for prey , while the argentine horned frog ( ceratophrys ornata ) lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes . among leaf litter frogs in panama , frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim , often brightly coloured and toxic , while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well - camouflaged . caecilians do not flick their tongues , but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward - pointing teeth . the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow . the subdued prey is gulped down whole . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when they are newly hatched , frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg . when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria , algal crusts , detritus and raspings from submerged plants . water is drawn in through their mouths , which are usually at the bottom of their heads , and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out . others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth . they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment , filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths . some , such as the spadefoot toads , have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks , grunts or hisses and have not been much studied . a clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation , as in bats , or a form of communication . most salamanders are considered voiceless , but the california giant salamander ( dicamptodon ensatus ) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound . some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break frogs are much more vocal , especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates . the presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself . in most species , the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an air sac or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth . this may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator , helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere , or the water at times when the animal is submerged . the main vocalisation is the males loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory . this call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near . calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy . other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus . when a frog is attacked , a distress or fright call is emitted , often resembling a scream . the usually nocturnal cuban tree frog ( osteopilus septentrionalis ) produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians , but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges . these are usually feeding , breeding or sheltering sites . males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species , females and even juveniles are also involved . although in many frog species , females are larger than males , this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence . some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest , arms or thumbs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in salamanders , defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder . this may involve snapping , chasing and sometimes biting , occasionally causing the loss of a tail . the behaviour of red back salamanders ( plethodon cinereus ) has been much studied . 91 of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre ( yard ) of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock . a similar proportion , when moved experimentally a distance of 30 m , found their way back to their home base . these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas . much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals . an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively . if the intruder persisted , a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso - labial grooves . damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival , either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in frogs , male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations ; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates . in general , a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual , and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males . much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires . there is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders . holders of territories have a " home advantage " and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar - sized frogs . if threats are insufficient , chest to chest tussles may take place . fighting methods include pushing and shoving , deflating the opponents vocal sac , seizing him by the head , jumping on his back , biting , chasing , splashing , and ducking him under the water . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins , and lack claws , defensive armour , or spines . nevertheless , they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive . the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce . this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip . the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic . snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow african clawed frogs ( xenopus laevis ) , which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape . caecilians have been little studied in this respect , but the cayenne caecilian ( typhlonectes compressicauda ) produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in brazil . in some salamanders , the skin is poisonous . the rough - skinned newt ( taricha granulosa ) from north america and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ( ttx ) , the most toxic non - protein substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish . handling the newts does not cause harm , but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly . in feeding trials , fish , frogs , reptiles , birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible . the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake ( thamnophis sirtalis ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in locations where both snake and salamander co - exist , the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity . coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity . some frogs and toads are toxic , the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back . these regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be foul - tasting or cause various physical or neurological symptoms altogether , over 200 toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity . these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black , with the fire salamander ( salamandra salamandra ) being an example . once a predator has sampled one of these , it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal . in some species , such as the fire - bellied toad ( bombina spp . , the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked , exhibiting their bright colours to the predator . the frog allobates zaparo is not poisonous , but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality , a strategy that may deceive predators . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day , thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight . other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected . they have various colourings such as mottled browns , greys and olives to blend into the background . some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the north american northern short - tailed shrew ( blarina brevicauda ) . their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their poison - producing granular glands . a few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked , sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape . the tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached . the tail is regenerated later , but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce , and some spadefoot toads ( pelobates spp ) scream and leap towards the attacker . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in amphibians , there is evidence of habituation , associative learning through both classical and instrumental learning , and discrimination abilities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in one experiment , when offered live fruit flies ( drosophila virilis ) , salamanders chose the larger of 1 vs 2 and 2 vs 3 . frogs can distinguish between low numbers ( 1 vs 2 , 2 vs 3 , but not 3 vs 4 ) and large numbers ( 3 vs 6 , 4 vs 8 , but not 4 vs 6 ) of prey . this is irrespective of other characteristics , that is surface area , volume , weight and movement , although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break dramatic declines in amphibian populations , including population crashes and mass localized extinction , have been noted since the late 1980s from locations all over the world , and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity . in 2004 , the international union for conservation of nature ( iucn ) reported stating that currently birds , mammals , and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum 48 times greater than natural extinction rates—possibly 1024 times higher . in 2006 , there were believed to be 4035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle . of these , 1356 ( 33 ) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status . a number of causes are believed to be involved , including habitat destruction and modification , over - exploitation , pollution , introduced species , global warming , endocrine - disrupting pollutants , destruction of the ozone layer ( ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin , eyes , and eggs of amphibians ) , and diseases like chytridiomycosis . however , many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood , and are a topic of ongoing discussion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation . the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break predators that feed on amphibians are affected by their decline . the western terrestrial garter snake ( thamnophis elegans ) in california is largely aquatic and depends heavily on two species of frog that are decreasing in numbers , the yosemite toad ( bufo canorus ) and the mountain yellow - legged frog ( rana muscosa ) , putting the snakes future at risk . if the snake were to become scarce , this would affect birds of prey and other predators that feed on it . meanwhile , in the ponds and lakes , fewer frogs means fewer tadpoles . these normally play an important role in controlling the growth of algae and also forage on detritus that accumulates as sediment on the bottom . a reduction in the number of tadpoles may lead to an overgrowth of algae , resulting in depletion of oxygen in the water when the algae later die and decompose . aquatic invertebrates and fish might then die and there would be unpredictable ecological consequences . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the decline in amphibian and reptile populations has led to an awareness of the effects of pesticides on reptiles and amphibians . in the past , the argument that amphibians or reptiles were more susceptible to any chemical contamination than any land aquatic vertebrate was not supported by research until recently . amphibians and reptiles have complex life cycles , live in different climate and ecological zones , and are more vulnerable to chemical exposure . certain pesticides , such as organophosphates , neonicotinoids , and carbamates , react via cholinesterase inhibition . cholinesterase is an enzyme that causes the hydrolysis of acetylcholine , an excitatory neurotransmitter that is abundant in the nervous system . ache inhibitors are either reversible or irreversible , and carbamates are safer than organophosphorus insecticides , which are more likely to cause cholinergic poisoning . reptile exposure to an ache inhibitory pesticide may result in disruption of neural function in reptiles . the buildup of these inhibitory effects on motor performance , such as food consumption and other activities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the amphibian specialist group of the iucn is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation . amphibian ark is an organization that was formed to implement the ex - situ conservation recommendations of this plan , and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world , encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another measure would be to stop exploitation of frogs for human consumption . in the middle east , a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was already linked to an increase in mosquitoes and thus has direct consequences for human health . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 38: Alaska ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaska ( ; ; ; ; yupik : alaskaq ; ) is a state located in the western united states on the northwest extremity of north america . a semi - exclave of the , it borders the canadian province of british columbia and the territory of yukon to the east and shares a maritime border with the russian federations chukotka autonomous okrug to the west , just across the bering strait . to the north are the chukchi and beaufort seas of the arctic ocean , while the pacific ocean lies to the south and southwest . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaska is by far the largest state by area , comprising more total area than the next three largest states ( texas , california , and montana ) combined . it represents the seventh largest subnational division in the world . it is the third - least populous and the most sparsely populated state , but by far the continents most populous territory located mostly north of the 60th parallel , with a population of 736081 as of 2020—more than quadruple the combined populations of northern canada and greenland . approximately half of alaskas residents live within the anchorage metropolitan area . the state capital of juneau is the second - largest city in the united states by area , comprising more territory than the states of rhode island and delaware . the former capital of alaska , sitka , is the largest city by area . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break what is now alaska has been home to various indigenous peoples for thousands of years ; it is widely believed that the region served as the entry point for the initial settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge . the russian empire was the first to actively colonize the area beginning in the 18th century , eventually establishing russian america , which spanned most of the current state . the expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted its sale to the in 1867 for us7 million ( equivalent to million in ) , or approximately two cents per acre ( 4 / km2 ) . the area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territory on may 11 , 1912 . it was admitted as the 49th state of the on january 3 , 1959 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while it has one of the smallest state economies in the country , alaskas per capita income is among the highest , owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing , natural gas , and oil , all of which it has in abundance . united states armed forces bases and tourism are also a significant part of the economy ; more than half the state is federally owned public land , including a multitude of national forests , national parks , and wildlife refuges . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the indigenous population of alaska is proportionally the highest of any state , at over 15 percent . close to two dozen native languages are spoken , and alaskan natives exercise considerable influence in local and state politics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the name " alaska " was introduced in the russian colonial period when it was used to refer to the alaska peninsula . it was derived from an aleut - language idiom , " alaxsxaq " , meaning " the mainland " or , more literally , " the object towards which the action of the sea is directed " . it is also known as " alyeska " , the " great land " , an aleut word derived from the same root . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break numerous indigenous peoples occupied alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of european peoples to the area . linguistic and dna studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge . at the upward sun river site in the tanana valley in alaska , remains of a six - week - old infant were found . the babys dna showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the new world at the end of the pleistocene . ben potter , the university of alaska fairbanks archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the upward sun river site in 2013 , named this new group ancient beringians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today southeast alaska , along with parts of british columbia and the yukon . also in southeast were the haida , now well known for their unique arts . the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in 1887 , when president grover cleveland , and later the congress , granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla . all three of these peoples , as well as other indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast , experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late 18th through the mid - 19th century , with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the 1830s and 1860s , resulting in high fatalities and social disruption . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aleutian islands are still home to the aleut peoples seafaring society , although they were the first native alaskans to be exploited by the russians . western and southwestern alaska are home to the yupik , while their cousins the alutiiq sugpiaq live in what is now southcentral alaska . the gwichin people of the northern interior region are athabaskan and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the much - contested arctic national wildlife refuge . the north slope and little diomede island are occupied by the widespread inupiat people . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some researchers believe the first russian settlement in alaska was established in the 17th century . according to this hypothesis , in 1648 several koches of semyon dezhnyovs expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement . this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi geographer nikolai daurkin , who had visited alaska in 1764–1765 and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river , populated by " bearded men " who " pray to the icons " . some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first european vessel to reach alaska is generally held to be the st . gabriel under the authority of the surveyor gvozdev and assistant navigator i . fyodorov on august 21 , 1732 , during an expedition of siberian cossack shestakov and russian explorer dmitry pavlutsky ( 1729–1735 ) . another european contact with alaska occurred in 1741 , when vitus bering led an expedition for the russian navy aboard the st . peter . after his crew returned to russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world , small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of siberia toward the aleutian islands . the first permanent european settlement was founded in 1784 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break between 1774 and 1800 , spain sent several expeditions to alaska to assert its claim over the pacific northwest . in 1789 , a spanish settlement and fort were built in nootka sound . these expeditions gave names to places such as valdez , bucareli sound , and cordova . later , the russian - american company carried out an expanded colonization program during the early - to - mid - 19th century . sitka , renamed new archangel from 1804 to 1867 , on baranof island in the alexander archipelago in what is now southeast alaska , became the capital of russian america . it remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the united states . the russians never fully colonized alaska , and the colony was never very profitable . evidence of russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeastern alaska . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break william seward , the 24th united states secretary of state , negotiated the alaska purchase ( also known as sewards folly ) with the russians in 1867 for 7 million . russias contemporary ruler tsar alexander ii , the emperor of the russian empire , king of poland and grand duke of finland , also planned the sale ; the purchase was made on march 30 , 1867 . six months later the commissioners arrived in sitka and the formal transfer was arranged ; the formal flag - raising took place at fort sitka on october 18 , 1867 . in the ceremony 250 uniformed soldiers marched to the governors house at " castle hill " , where the russian troops lowered the russian flag and the flag was raised . this event is celebrated as alaska day , a legal holiday on october 18 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaska was loosely governed by the military initially , and was administered as a district starting in 1884 , with a governor appointed by the united states president . a federal district court was headquartered in sitka . for most of alaskas first decade under the united states flag , sitka was the only community inhabited by american settlers . they organized a " provisional city government " , which was alaskas first municipal government , but not in a legal sense . legislation allowing alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until 1900 , and home rule for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in 1959 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break starting in the 1890s and stretching in some places to the early 1910s , gold rushes in alaska and the nearby yukon territory brought thousands of miners and settlers to alaska . alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in 1912 . alaskas capital , which had been in sitka until 1906 , was moved north to juneau . construction of the alaska governors mansion began that same year . european immigrants from norway and sweden also settled in southeast alaska , where they entered the fishing and logging industries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during world war ii , the aleutian islands campaign focused on attu , agattu and kiska , all which were occupied by the empire of japan . during the japanese occupation , a white american civilian and two united states navy personnel were killed at attu and kiska respectively , and nearly a total of 50 aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in japan . about half of the aleuts died during the period of internment . unalaska / dutch harbor and adak became significant bases for the united states army , united states army air forces and united states navy . the united states lend - lease program involved flying american warplanes through canada to fairbanks and then nome ; soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft , ferrying them to fight the german invasion of the soviet union . the construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some alaskan cities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break statehood for alaska was an important cause of james wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate . decades later , the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946 . the alaska statehood committee and alaskas constitutional convention would soon follow . statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes , mostly in the congress but also within alaska . statehood was approved by the congress on july 7 , 1958 ; alaska was officially proclaimed a state on january 3 , 1959 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on march 27 , 1964 , the massive good friday earthquake killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities , mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides . it was the second - most - powerful earthquake in recorded history , with a moment magnitude of 9 ( more than a thousand times as powerful as the 1989 san francisco earthquake ) . the time of day ( 5 : 36 pm ) , time of year ( spring ) and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives , particularly in anchorage . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 1968 discovery of oil at prudhoe bay and the 1977 completion of the trans - alaska pipeline system led to an oil boom . royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break that same year , not coincidentally , alaska repealed its state income tax . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1989 , the exxon valdez hit a reef in the prince william sound , spilling more than 11 musgal of crude oil over 1100 mi of coastline . today , the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the proposed pebble mine . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break located at the northwest corner of north america , alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the united states , but also has the most easterly longitude in the united states because the aleutian islands extend into the eastern hemisphere . alaska is the only non - contiguous state on continental north america ; about 500 mi of british columbia ( canada ) separates alaska from washington . it is technically part of the continental , but is sometimes not included in colloquial use ; alaska is not part of the contiguous , often called " the lower 48 " . the capital city , juneau , is situated on the mainland of the north american continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the north american highway system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the state is bordered by canadas yukon and british columbia to the east ( making it the only state to border a canadian territory ) ; the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south and southwest ; the bering sea , bering strait , and chukchi sea to the west ; and the arctic ocean to the north . alaskas territorial waters touch russias territorial waters in the bering strait , as the russian big diomede island and alaskan little diomede island are only 3 mi apart . alaska has a longer coastline than all the other states combined . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at 663268 sqmi in area , alaska is by far the largest state in the united states , and is more than twice the size of the second - largest state , texas . alaska is the seventh largest subnational division in the world , and if it was an independent nation would be the 16th largest country in the world , as it is larger than iran . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with its myriad islands , alaska has nearly 34000 mi of tidal shoreline . the aleutian islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the alaska peninsula . many active volcanoes are found in the aleutians and in coastal regions . unimak island , for example , is home to mount shishaldin , which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to 10000 ft above the north pacific . the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr , west of anchorage on the mainland . geologists have identified alaska as part of wrangellia , a large region consisting of multiple states and canadian provinces in the pacific northwest , which is actively undergoing continent building . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one of the worlds largest tides occurs in turnagain arm , just south of anchorage , where tidal differences can be more than 35 ft . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaska has more than three million lakes . marshlands and wetland permafrost cover 188320 sqmi ( mostly in northern , western and southwest flatlands ) . glacier ice covers about 28957 sqmi of alaska . the bering glacier is the largest glacier in north america , covering 2008 sqmi alone . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of alaska , but there are six widely accepted regions : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the most populous region of alaska , containing anchorage , the matanuska - susitna valley and the kenai peninsula . rural , mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of south central , as do the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova and valdez . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage , this is the region of alaska closest to the contiguous states . as such , this was where most of the initial non - indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase . the region is dominated by the alexander archipelago as well as the tongass national forest , the largest national forest in the united states . it contains the state capital juneau , the former capital sitka , and ketchikan , at one time alaskas largest city . the alaska marine highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area and country , as only three communities ( haines , hyder and skagway ) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous north american road system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the interior is the largest region of alaska ; much of it is uninhabited wilderness . fairbanks is the only large city in the region . denali national park and preserve is located here . denali , formerly mount mckinley , is the highest mountain in north america , and is also located here . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break southwest alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some 500 mi inland from the bering sea . most of the population lives along the coast . kodiak island is also located in southwest . the massive yukon–kuskokwim delta , one of the largest river deltas in the world , is here . portions of the alaska peninsula are considered part of southwest , with the remaining portions included with the aleutian islands ( see below ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages . the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the national petroleum reserve–alaska and the prudhoe bay oil field . the city of utqiaġvik , formerly known as barrow , is the northernmost city in the united states and is located here . the northwest arctic area , anchored by kotzebue and also containing the kobuk river valley , is often regarded as being part of this region . however , the respective inupiat of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break more than 300 small volcanic islands make up this chain , which stretches more than 1200 mi into the pacific ocean . some of these islands fall in the eastern hemisphere , but the international date line was drawn west of 180° to keep the whole state , and thus the entire north american continent , within the same legal day . two of the islands , attu and kiska , were occupied by japanese forces during world war ii . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to an october 1998 report by the united states bureau of land management , approximately 65 of alaska is owned and managed by the federal government as public lands , including a multitude of national forests , national parks , and national wildlife refuges . of these , the bureau of land management manages 87 e6acre , or 23 of the state . the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service . it is the worlds largest wildlife refuge , comprising 16 e6acre . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break of the remaining land area , the state of alaska owns 101 e6acre , its entitlement under the alaska statehood act . a portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to the organized boroughs presented above , under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs . smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading - related opportunities . these are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations . the university of alaska , as a land grant university , also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another 44 e6acre are owned by 12 regional , and scores of local , native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act ( ancsa ) of 1971 . regional native corporation doyon , limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications . provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations ' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect . effectively , the corporations hold title ( including subsurface title in many cases , a privilege denied to individual alaskans ) but cannot sell the land . individual native allotments can be and are sold on the open market , however . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break various private interests own the remaining land , totaling about one percent of the state . alaska is , by a large margin , the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when native corporation holdings are excluded . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alaska heritage resources survey ( ahrs ) is a restricted inventory of all reported historic and prehistoric sites within the state of alaska ; it is maintained by the office of history and archaeology . the surveys inventory of cultural resources includes objects , structures , buildings , sites , districts , and travel ways , with a general provision that they are more than fifty years old . , more than 35000 sites have been reported . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaska is not divided into counties , as most of the other states , but it is divided into boroughs . delegates to the alaska constitutional convention wanted to avoid the pitfalls of the traditional county system and adopted their own unique model . many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of alaskas 16 boroughs , which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states . however , unlike county - equivalents in the other 49 states , the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state . the area not part of any borough is referred to as the unorganized borough . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the unorganized borough has no government of its own , but the census bureau in cooperation with the state divided the unorganized borough into 11 census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation . a recording district is a mechanism for management of the public record in alaska . the state is divided into 34 recording districts which are centrally administered under a state recorder . all recording districts use the same acceptance criteria , fee schedule , etcetera , for accepting documents into the public record . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break whereas many states use a three - tiered system of decentralization—state / county / township—most of alaska uses only two tiers—state / borough . owing to the low population density , most of the land is located in the unorganized borough . as the name implies , it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government . in 2000 , 57 of alaskas area has this status , with 13 of the population . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anchorage merged the city government with the greater anchorage area borough in 1975 to form the municipality of anchorage , containing the city proper and the communities of eagle river , chugiak , peters creek , girdwood , bird , and indian . fairbanks has a separate borough ( the fairbanks north star borough ) and municipality ( the city of fairbanks ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the states most populous city is anchorage , home to 291247 people in 2020 . the richest location in alaska by per capita income is denali ( 42245 ) . yakutat city , sitka , juneau , and anchorage are the four largest cities in the by area . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as reflected in the 2020 united states census , alaska has a total of 355 incorporated cities and census - designated places ( cdps ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the tally of cities includes four unified municipalities , essentially the equivalent of a consolidated city–county . the majority of these communities are located in the rural expanse of alaska known as " the bush " and are unconnected to the contiguous north american road network . the table at the bottom of this section lists the 100 largest cities and census - designated places in alaska , in population order . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break of alaskas 2020 census population figure of 733391 , 16655 people , or 2 of the population , did not live in an incorporated city or census - designated place . approximately three - quarters of that figure were people who live in urban and suburban neighborhoods on the outskirts of the city limits of ketchikan , kodiak , palmer and wasilla . cdps have not been established for these areas by the united states census bureau , except that seven cdps were established for the ketchikan - area neighborhoods in the 1980 census ( clover pass , herring cove , ketchikan east , mountain point , north tongass highway , pennock island and saxman east ) , but have not been used since . the remaining population was scattered throughout alaska , both within organized boroughs and in the unorganized borough , in largely remote areas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the climate in south and southeastern alaska is a mid - latitude oceanic climate ( köppen climate classification : cfb ) , and a subarctic oceanic climate ( köppen cfc ) in the northern parts . on an annual basis , the southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year . juneau averages over 50 in of precipitation a year , and ketchikan averages over 150 in . this is also the only region in alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months . öppen climate types of alaskathe climate of anchorage and south central alaska is mild by alaskan standards due to the regions proximity to the seacoast . while the area gets less rain than southeast alaska , it gets more snow , and days tend to be clearer . on average , anchorage receives 16 in of precipitation a year , with around 75 in of snow , although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow . it is a subarctic climate ( köppen : dfc ) due to its brief , cool summers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the climate of western alaska is determined in large part by the bering sea and the gulf of alaska . it is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north . the temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is . this region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation . an area stretching from the northern side of the seward peninsula to the kobuk river valley ( that is , the region around kotzebue sound ) is technically a desert , with portions receiving less than 10 in of precipitation annually . on the other extreme , some locations between dillingham and bethel average around 100 in of precipitation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the climate of the interior of alaska is subarctic . some of the highest and lowest temperatures in alaska occur around the area near fairbanks . the summers may have temperatures reaching into the 90s °f ( the low - to - mid 30s °c ) , while in the winter , the temperature can fall below - 60 °f . precipitation is sparse in the interior , often less than 10 in a year , but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the highest and lowest recorded temperatures in alaska are both in the interior . the highest is 100 °f in fort yukon ( which is just 8 mi inside the arctic circle ) on june 27 , 1915 , making alaska tied with hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the united states . the lowest official alaska temperature is −80 °f in prospect creek on january 23 , 1971 , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the climate in the extreme north of alaska is arctic ( köppen : et ) with long , very cold winters and short , cool summers . even in july , the average low temperature in utqiaġvik is 34 °f . precipitation is light in this part of alaska , with many places averaging less than 10 in per year , mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the united states census bureau found in the 2020 united states census that the population of alaska was 736081 on april 1 , 2020 , a 3 increase since the 2010 united states census . according to the 2010 united states census , the state of alaska had a population of 710231 , increasing from 626932 at the 2000 census . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2010 , alaska ranked as the 47th state by population , ahead of north dakota , vermont , and wyoming ( and washington , ) . estimates show north dakota ahead . alaska is the least densely populated state , and one of the most sparsely populated areas in the world , at 1 pd / sqmi , with the next state , wyoming , at 5 pd / sqmi . alaska is by far the largest state by area , and the tenth wealthiest ( per capita income ) . due to its population size , it is one of 14 states that still have only one telephone area code . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the state was 66 white ( 64 non - hispanic white ) , 14 american indian and alaska native , 5 asian , 3 black or african american , 1 native hawaiian and other pacific islander , 1 from some other race , and 7 from two or more races in 2010 . hispanics or latin americans of any race made up 5 of the population in 2010 . , 50 of alaskas population younger than one year of age belonged to minority groups ( that is , did not have two parents of non - hispanic white ancestry ) . in 1960 , the united states census bureau reported alaskas population as 77 white , 3 black , and 18 american indian and alaska native . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to the 2011 american community survey , 83 of people over the age of five spoke only english at home . about 3 spoke spanish at home , 2 spoke another indo - european language , about 4 spoke an asian language ( including tagalog ) , and about 5 spoke other languages at home . in 2019 , the american community survey determined 83 spoke only english , and 16 spoke another language other than english . the most spoken european language after english was spanish , spoken by approximately 4 of the state population . collectively , asian and pacific islander languages were spoken by 5 of alaskans . since 2010 , a total of 5 of alaskans speak one of the states 20 indigenous languages , known locally as " native languages " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alaska native language center at the university of alaska fairbanks claims that at least 20 alaskan native languages exist and there are also some languages with different dialects . most of alaskas native languages belong to either the eskimo–aleut or na - dene language families ; however , some languages are thought to be isolates ( for example haida ) or have not yet been classified ( for example tsimshianic ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in october 2014 , the governor of alaska signed a bill declaring the states 20 indigenous languages to have official status . this bill gave them symbolic recognition as official languages , though they have not been adopted for official use within the government . the 20 languages that were included in the bill are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to statistics collected by the association of religion data archives from 2010 , about 34 of alaska residents were members of religious congregations . of the religious population , 100960 people identified as evangelical protestants ; 50866 as roman catholic ; and 32550 as mainline protestants . roughly 4 were mormon , 0 jewish , 0 muslim , 1 buddhist , 0 baháʼí , and 0 hindu . the largest religious denominations in alaska was the catholic church with 50866 adherents ; non - denominational evangelicals with 38070 adherents ; the church of jesus christ of latter - day saints with 32170 adherents ; and the southern baptist convention with 19891 adherents . alaska has been identified , along with washington and oregon in the pacific northwest , as being the least religious states in the united states , in terms of church membership . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the pew research center in 2014 determined 62 of the adult population practiced christianity . protestantism was the largest christian tradition , dominated by evangelicalism . mainline protestants were the second largest protestant christian group , followed by predominantly african american churches . the catholic church remained the largest single christian tradition practiced in alaska . of the unaffiliated population , they made up the largest non - christian religious affiliation . atheists made up 5 of the population and the largest non - christian religion was buddhism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1795 , the first russian orthodox church was established in kodiak . intermarriage with alaskan natives helped the russian immigrants integrate into society . as a result , an increasing number of russian orthodox churches gradually became established within alaska . alaska also has the largest quaker population ( by percentage ) of any state . in 2009 , there were 6000 jews in alaska ( for whom observance of halakha may pose special problems ) . alaskan hindus often share venues and celebrations with members of other asian religious communities , including sikhs and jains . in 2010 , alaskan hindus established the sri ganesha temple of alaska , making it the first hindu temple in alaska and the northernmost hindu temple in the world . there are an estimated 2000–3000 hindus in alaska . the vast majority of hindus live in anchorage or fairbanks . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break estimates for the number of muslims in alaska range from 2000 to 5000 . the islamic community center of anchorage began efforts in the late 1990s to construct a mosque in anchorage . they broke ground on a building in south anchorage in 2010 and were nearing completion in late 2014 . when completed , the mosque will be the first in the state and one of the northernmost mosques in the world . theres also a baháʼí center . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 2018 gross state product was 55 billion , 48th in the its per capita personal income for 2018 was 73000 , ranking 7th in the nation . according to a 2013 study by phoenix marketing international , alaska had the fifth - largest number of millionaires per capita in the united states , with a ratio of 6 percent . the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy , with more than 80 of the states revenues derived from petroleum extraction . alaskas main export product ( excluding oil and natural gas ) is seafood , primarily salmon , cod , pollock and crab . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agriculture represents a very small fraction of the alaskan economy . agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock , dairy products , vegetables , and livestock . manufacturing is limited , with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction , shipping , and transportation . military bases are a significant component of the economy in the fairbanks north star , anchorage and kodiak island boroughs , as well as kodiak . federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy , allowing the state to keep taxes low . its industrial outputs are crude petroleum , natural gas , coal , gold , precious metals , zinc and other mining , seafood processing , timber and wood products . there is also a growing service and tourism sector . tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaska has vast energy resources , although its oil reserves have been largely depleted . major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope ( ans ) and cook inlet basins , but according to the energy information administration , by february 2014 alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas , north dakota , and california . prudhoe bay on alaskas north slope is still the second highest - yielding oil field in the united states , typically producing about 400000 oilbbl / d , although by early 2014 north dakotas bakken formation was producing over 900000 oilbbl / d . prudhoe bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in north america , but was much smaller than canadas enormous athabasca oil sands field , which by 2014 was producing about of unconventional oil , and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the trans - alaska pipeline can transport and pump up to 2 moilbbl of crude oil per day , more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states . additionally , substantial coal deposits are found in alaskas bituminous , sub - bituminous , and lignite coal basins . the united states geological survey estimates that there are 85 tcuft of undiscovered , technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope . alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers . large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaskas economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating , transportation , electric power and light . although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped , proposals for statewide energy systems ( for example with special low - cost electric interties ) were judged uneconomical ( at the time of the report , 2001 ) due to low ( less than 50¢ / gal ) fuel prices , long distances and low population . the cost of a gallon of gas in urban alaska today is usually thirty to sixty cents higher than the national average ; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs , seasonal usage peaks , nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues , established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil , largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed trans - alaska pipeline system . the fund was originally proposed by governor keith miller on the eve of the 1969 prudhoe bay lease sale , out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale ( which amounted to 900million ) at once . it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai state representative hugh malone . it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since , diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose . the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this , mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation . from its initial principal of 734000 , the fund has grown to 50billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska . this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska , though such a stance has never gained momentum . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break starting in 1982 , dividends from the funds annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans , ranging from an initial 1000 in 1982 ( equal to three years ' payout , as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme ) to 3269 in 2008 ( which included a one - time 1200 " resource rebate " ) . every year , the state legislature takes out 8 from the earnings , puts 3 back into the principal for inflation proofing , and the remaining 5 is distributed to all qualifying alaskans . to qualify for the permanent fund dividend , one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months , maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences , and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a basic income policy in the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states . federal government employees , particularly united states postal service ( usps ) workers and active - duty military members , receive a cost of living allowance usually set at 25 of base pay because , while the cost of living has gone down , it is still one of the highest in the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country , due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to the northern climate and short growing season , relatively little farming occurs in alaska . most farms are in either the matanuska valley , about 40 mi northeast of anchorage , or on the kenai peninsula , about 60 mi southwest of anchorage . the short 100 - day growing season limits the crops that can be grown , but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons . the primary crops are potatoes , carrots , lettuce , and cabbage . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus , especially the delta junction area , about 100 mi southeast of fairbanks , with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops ; these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely . this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor . delta - area crops consist predominantly of barley and hay . west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants , the hotel and tourist industry , and community - supported agriculture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners , small farms and farmers ' markets in recent years , with the highest percentage increase ( 46 ) in the nation in growth in farmers ' markets in 2011 , compared to 17 nationwide . the peony industry has also taken off , as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world , thereby filling a niche in the flower market . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaska , with no counties , lacks county fairs . however , a small assortment of state and local fairs ( with the alaska state fair in palmer the largest ) , are held mostly in the late summer . the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity , and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high - profile commercial activities such as carnival rides , concerts and food . " alaska grown " is used as an agricultural slogan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaska has an abundance of seafood , with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific . seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it . many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence , as well as sport . this includes fish taken by hook , net or wheel . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hunting for subsistence , primarily caribou , moose , and dall sheep is still common in the state , particularly in remote bush communities . an example of a traditional native food is akutaq , the eskimo ice cream , which can consist of reindeer fat , seal oil , dried fish meat and local berries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaskas reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula , where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most food in alaska is transported into the state from " outside " ( the other 49 us states ) , and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive . in rural areas , subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive . although most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline , the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high , because of the terrain and difficult road conditions , which change dramatically , due to varying climate and precipitation changes . the cost of transport can reach as high as 50¢ per pound ( 1 / kg ) or more in some remote areas , during the most difficult times , if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions . the cost of delivering a 1 usgal of milk is about 3 in many villages where per capita income can be 20000 or less . fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the contiguous united states average , with only hawaii having higher prices . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some of alaskas popular annual events are the iditarod trail sled dog race from anchorage to nome , world ice art championships in fairbanks , the blueberry festival and alaska hummingbird festival in ketchikan , the sitka whale fest , and the stikine river garnet fest in wrangell . the stikine river attracts the largest springtime concentration of american bald eagles in the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alaska native heritage center celebrates the rich heritage of alaskas 11 cultural groups . their purpose is to encourage cross - cultural exchanges among all people and enhance self - esteem among native people . the alaska native arts foundation promotes and markets native art from all regions and cultures in the state , using the internet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break influences on music in alaska include the traditional music of alaska natives as well as folk music brought by later immigrants from russia and europe . prominent musicians from alaska include singer jewel , traditional aleut flautist mary youngblood , folk singer - songwriter libby roderick , christian music singer - songwriter lincoln brewster , metal / post hardcore band 36 crazyfists and the groups pamyua and portugal . the man . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are many established music festivals in alaska , including the alaska folk festival , the fairbanks summer arts festival the anchorage folk festival , the athabascan old - time fiddling festival , the sitka jazz festival , and the sitka summer music festival . the most prominent orchestra in alaska is the anchorage symphony orchestra , though the fairbanks symphony orchestra and juneau symphony are also notable . the anchorage opera is currently the states only professional opera company , though there are several volunteer and semi - professional organizations in the state as well . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the official state song of alaska is " alaskas flag " , which was adopted in 1955 ; it celebrates the flag of alaska . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaskas first independent picture entirely made in alaska was the chechahcos , produced by alaskan businessman austin lathrop and filmed in and around anchorage . released in 1924 by the alaska moving picture corporation , it was the only film the company made . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one of the most prominent movies filmed in alaska is mgms eskimo / mala the magnificent , starring alaska native ray mala . in 1932 , an expedition set out from mgms studios in hollywood to alaska to film what was then billed as " the biggest picture ever made " . upon arriving in alaska , they set up " camp hollywood " in northwest alaska , where they lived during the duration of the filming . louis mayer spared no expense in spite of the remote location , going so far as to hire the chef from the hotel roosevelt in hollywood to prepare meals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when eskimo premiered at the astor theatre in new york city , the studio received the largest amount of feedback in its history . eskimo was critically acclaimed and released worldwide ; as a result , mala became an international movie star . eskimo won the first oscar for best film editing at the academy awards , and showcased and preserved aspects of inupiat culture on film . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 1983 disney movie never cry wolf was at least partially shot in alaska . the 1991 film white fang , based on jack londons 1906 novel and starring ethan hawke , was filmed in and around haines . steven seagals 1994 on deadly ground , starring michael caine , was filmed in part at the worthington glacier near valdez . the 1999 john sayles film limbo , starring david strathairn , mary elizabeth mastrantonio , and kris kristofferson , was filmed in juneau . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the psychological thriller insomnia , starring al pacino and robin williams , was shot in canada , but was set in alaska . the 2007 film directed by sean penn , into the wild , was partially filmed and set in alaska . the film , which is based on the novel of the same name , follows the adventures of christopher mccandless , who died in a remote abandoned bus along the stampede trail west of healy in 1992 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many films and television shows set in alaska are not filmed there ; for example , northern exposure , set in the fictional town of cicely , alaska , was filmed in roslyn , washington . the 2007 horror feature 30 days of night is set in barrow , alaska , but was filmed in new zealand . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many reality television shows are filmed in alaska . in 2011 , the anchorage daily news found ten set in the state . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alaska state troopers are alaskas statewide police force . they have a long and storied history , but were not an official organization until 1941 . before the force was officially organized , law enforcement in alaska was handled by various federal agencies . larger towns usually have their own local police and some villages rely on " public safety officers " who have police training but do not carry firearms in much of the state , the troopers serve as the only police force available . in addition to enforcing traffic and criminal law , wildlife troopers enforce hunting and fishing regulations . due to the varied terrain and wide scope of the troopers ' duties , they employ a wide variety of land , air , and water patrol vehicles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many rural communities in alaska are considered " dry " , having outlawed the importation of alcoholic beverages . suicide rates for rural residents are higher than urban . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break domestic abuse and other violent crimes are also at high levels in the state ; this is in part linked to alcohol abuse . alaska has the highest rate of sexual assault in the nation , especially in rural areas . the average age of sexually assaulted victims is 16 years old . in four out of five cases , the suspects were relatives , friends or acquaintances . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alaska department of education and early development administers many school districts in alaska . in addition , the state operates a boarding school , mt . edgecumbe high school in sitka , and provides partial funding for other boarding schools , including nenana student living center in nenana and the galena interior learning academy in galena . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are more than a dozen colleges and universities in alaska . accredited universities in alaska include the university of alaska anchorage , university of alaska fairbanks , university of alaska southeast , and alaska pacific university . alaska is the only state that has no institutions that are part of ncaa division i . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alaska department of labor and workforce development operates avtec , alaskas institute of technology . campuses in seward and anchorage offer one - week to 11 - month training programs in areas as diverse as information technology , welding , nursing , and mechanics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaska has had a problem with a " brain drain " . many of its young people , including most of the highest academic achievers , leave the state after high school graduation and do not return . , alaska did not have a law school or medical school . the university of alaska has attempted to combat this by offering partial four - year scholarships to the top 10 of alaska high school graduates , via the alaska scholars program . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beginning in 1998 , schools in rural alaska must have at least 10 students to retain funding from the state , and campuses not meeting the number close . this was due to the loss in oil revenues that previously propped up smaller rural schools . in 2015 , there was a proposal to raise that minimum to 25 , but legislators in the state largely did not agree . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the the states road system , covering a relatively small area of the state , linking the central population centers and the alaska highway , the principal route out of the state through canada . the state capital , juneau , is not accessible by road , only a car ferry ; this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system , or building a road connection from haines . the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the interstate highways in alaska consists of a total of . one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel , an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier on prince william sound to the seward highway about 50 mi southeast of anchorage at portage . at 2 mi , the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until 2007 . the tunnel is the longest combination road and rail tunnel in north america . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break built around 1915 , the alaska railroad ( arr ) played a key role in the development of alaska through the 20th century . it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward to interior alaska by way of south central alaska , passing through anchorage , eklutna , wasilla , talkeetna , denali , and fairbanks , with spurs to whittier , palmer and north pole . the cities , towns , villages , and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as " the railbelt " . in recent years , the ever - improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroads importance in alaskas economy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the railroad played a vital role in alaskas development , moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward , such as coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage . it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains . it continues to offer one of the last flag stop routes in the country . a stretch of about 60 mi of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by road ; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area . until construction of the parks highway in the 1970s , the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in northern southeast alaska , the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway northwards into canada ( british columbia and yukon territory ) , crossing the border at white pass summit . this line is now mainly used by tourists , often arriving by cruise liner at skagway . it was featured in the 1983 bbc television series great little railways . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alaska rail network is not connected to outside . ( the nearest link to the north american railway network is the northwest terminus of the canadian national railway at prince rupert , british columbia , several hundred miles to the southeast . in 2000 , the congress authorized 6million to study the feasibility of a rail link between alaska , canada , and the lower 48 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some private companies provides car float service between whittier and seattle . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many cities , towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access ; the only modes of access involve travel by air , river , or the sea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alaskas well - developed state - owned ferry system ( known as the alaska marine highway ) serves the cities of southeast , the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula . the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers . the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham , washington and prince rupert , british columbia , in canada through the inside passage to skagway . the inter - island ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in recent years , cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market , mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and , to a lesser degree , towns along alaskas gulf coast . the population of ketchikan for example fluctuates dramatically on many days—up to four large cruise ships can dock there at the same time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cities not served by road , sea , or river can be reached only by air , foot , dogsled , or snowmachine , accounting for alaskas extremely well developed bush air services—an alaskan novelty . anchorage and , to a lesser extent fairbanks , is served by many major airlines . because of limited highway access , air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state . anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism ( in 2012–2013 , alaska received almost two million visitors ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break state of alaska office of economic development .

late 1920s ) , dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation . various races are held around the state , but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race , a 1150 mi trail from anchorage to nome ( although the distance varies from year to year , the official distance is set at 1049 mi ) . the race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo and balto took much - needed medicine to the diphtheria - stricken community of nome when all other means of transportation had failed . mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash , prizes , and prestige . the " serum run " is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay , leaving from the community of nenana ( southwest of fairbanks ) to nome . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in areas not served by road or rail , primary transportation in summer is by all -

*********** Article 39: Agriculture ***********

agriculture or farming is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock . agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization , whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities . the history of agriculture began thousands of years ago . after gathering wild grains beginning at least 105000 years ago , nascent farmers began to plant them around 11500 years ago . pigs , sheep , and cattle were domesticated over 10000 years ago . plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world . industrial agriculture based on large - scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output , though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods , fibers , fuels , and raw materials ( such as rubber ) . food classes include cereals ( grains ) , vegetables , fruits , oils , meat , milk , eggs , and fungi . over one - third of the worlds workers are employed in agriculture , second only to the service sector , although in recent decades , the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers continues , especially in developing countries , where smallholding is being overtaken by industrial agriculture and mechanization that brings an enormous crop yield increase . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break modern agronomy , plant breeding , agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers , and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields , but cause ecological and environmental damage . selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage . environmental issues include contributions to global warming , depletion of aquifers , deforestation , antibiotic resistance , and growth hormones in industrial meat production . agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation , such as biodiversity loss , desertification , soil degradation , and global warming , all of which can cause decreases in crop yield . genetically modified organisms are widely used , although some are banned in certain countries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word agriculture is a late middle english adaptation of latin , from ' field ' and ' cultivation ' or ' growing ' . while agriculture usually refers to human activities , certain species of ant , termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to 60 million years . agriculture is defined with varying scopes , in its broadest sense using natural resources to " produce commodities which maintain life , including food , fiber , forest products , horticultural crops , and their related services " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it may also be broadly decomposed into plant agriculture , which concerns the cultivation of useful plants , and animal agriculture , the production of agricultural animals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering . agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe , and included a diverse range of taxa , in at least 11 separate centers of origin . wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105000 years ago . in the paleolithic levant , 23000 years ago , cereals cultivation of emmer , barley , and oats has been observed near the sea of galilee . rice was domesticated in china between 11500 and 6200 bc with the earliest known cultivation from 5700 bc , followed by mung , soy and azuki beans . sheep were domesticated in mesopotamia between 13000 and 11000 years ago . cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern turkey and pakistan some 10500 years ago . pig production emerged in eurasia , including europe , east asia and southwest asia , where wild boar were first domesticated about 10500 years ago . in the andes of south america , the potato was domesticated between 10000 and 7000 years ago , along with beans , coca , llamas , alpacas , and guinea pigs . sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in new guinea around 9000 years ago . sorghum was domesticated in the sahel region of africa by 7000 years ago . cotton was domesticated in peru by 5600 years ago , and was independently domesticated in eurasia . in mesoamerica , wild teosinte was bred into maize by 6000 years ago . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture . studies of the transition from hunter - gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism ; examples are the natufian culture in the levant , and the early chinese neolithic in china . then , wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted , and gradually came to be domesticated . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in eurasia , the sumerians started to live in villages from about 8000 bc , relying on the tigris and euphrates rivers and a canal system for irrigation . ploughs appear in pictographs around 3000 bc ; seed - ploughs around 2300 bc . farmers grew wheat , barley , vegetables such as lentils and onions , and fruits including dates , grapes , and figs . ancient egyptian agriculture relied on the nile river and its seasonal flooding . farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the paleolithic , after 10000 bc . staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley , alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus . in india , wheat , barley and jujube were domesticated by 9000 bc , soon followed by sheep and goats . cattle , sheep and goats were domesticated in mehrgarh culture by 8000–6000 bc . cotton was cultivated by the 5th–4th millennium bc . archeological evidence indicates an animal - drawn plough from 2500 bc in the indus valley civilisation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in china , from the 5th century bc there was a nationwide granary system and widespread silk farming . water - powered grain mills were in use by the 1st century bc , followed by irrigation . by the late 2nd century , heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards . these spread westwards across eurasia . asian rice was domesticated 8200–13500 years ago – depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used– on the pearl river in southern china with a single genetic origin from the wild rice oryza rufipogon . in greece and rome , the major cereals were wheat , emmer , and barley , alongside vegetables including peas , beans , and olives . sheep and goats were kept mainly for dairy products . gricultural scenes of ' a ' , ' grain ' , ' store , ' , ' harvesting ' , ' with ' , ' sickles , ' , ' digging , ' , ' tree -

stick farming . the natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a low - intensity fire ecology that sustained a low - density agriculture in loose rotation ; a sort of " wild " permaculture . a system of companion planting called the three sisters was developed in north america . the three crops were winter squash , maize , and climbing beans . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break indigenous australians , long supposed to have been nomadic hunter - gatherers , practised systematic burning , possibly to enhance natural productivity in fire - stick farming . scholars have pointed out that hunter - gatherers need a productive environment to support gathering without cultivation . because the forests of new guinea have few food plants , early humans may have used " selective burning " to increase the productivity of the wild karuka fruit trees to support the hunter - gatherer way of life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the gunditjmara and other groups developed eel farming and fish trapping systems from some 5000 years ago . there is evidence of ' intensification ' across the whole continent over that period . in two regions of australia , the central west coast and eastern central , early farmers cultivated yams , native millet , and bush onions , possibly in permanent settlements . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the middle ages , compared to the roman period , agriculture in western europe became more focused on self - sufficiency . the agricultural population under feudalism was typically organized into manors consisting of several hundred or more acres of land presided over by a lord with a roman catholic church and priest . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break thanks to the exchange with the al - andalus where the arab agricultural revolution was underway , european agriculture transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants , including the introduction of sugar , rice , cotton and fruit trees ( such as the orange ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after 1492 the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize , potatoes , tomatoes , sweet potatoes and manioc to europe , and old world crops such as wheat , barley , rice and turnips , and livestock ( including horses , cattle , sheep and goats ) to the americas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break irrigation , crop rotation , and fertilizers advanced from the 17th century with the british agricultural revolution , allowing global population to rise significantly . since 1900 agriculture in developed nations , and to a lesser extent in the developing world , has seen large rises in productivity as mechanization replaces human labor , and assisted by synthetic fertilizers , pesticides , and selective breeding . the haber - bosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale , greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining a further increase in global population . modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological , political , and economic issues including water pollution , biofuels , genetically modified organisms , tariffs and farm subsidies , leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals . in nomadic pastoralism , herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture , fodder , and water . this type of farming is practised in arid and semi - arid regions of sahara , central asia and some parts of india . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in shifting cultivation , a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees . the cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil becomes too infertile , and the area is abandoned . another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated . this type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly . this practice is used in northeast india , southeast asia , and the amazon basin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone , with little left over for transport elsewhere . it is intensively practiced in monsoon asia and south - east asia . an estimated 2 billion subsistence farmers worked in 2018 , cultivating about 60 of the earths arable land . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break intensive farming is cultivation to maximise productivity , with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs ( water , fertilizer , pesticide and automation ) . it is practiced mainly in developed countries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from the twentieth century , intensive agriculture increased productivity . it substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour , but caused increased water pollution , and often involved farm subsidies . in recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture , resulting in the organic , regenerative , and sustainable agriculture movements . one of the major forces behind this movement has been the european union , which first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its common agricultural policy ( cap ) in 2005 to phase out commodity - linked farm subsidies , also known as decoupling . the growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management , selective breeding , and controlled - environment agriculture . recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food . demand for non - food biofuel crops , development of former farm lands , rising transportation costs , climate change , growing consumer demand in china and india , and population growth , are threatening food security in many parts of the world . the international fund for agricultural development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security , given the favorable experience of vietnam . soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally ; approximately 40 of the worlds agricultural land is seriously degraded . by 2015 , the agricultural output of china was the largest in the world , followed by the european union , india and the united states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following the three - sector theory , the number of people employed in agriculture and other primary activities ( such as fishing ) can be more than 80 in the least developed countries , and less than 2 in the most highly developed countries . since the industrial revolution , many countries have made the transition to developed economies , and the proportion of people working in agriculture has steadily fallen . during the 16th century in europe , for example , between 55 and 75 of the population was engaged in agriculture ; by the 19th century , this had dropped to between 35 and 65 . in the same countries today , the figure is less than 10 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the start of the 21st century , some one billion people , or over 1 / 3 of the available work force , were employed in agriculture . it constitutes approximately 70 of the global employment of children , and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agriculture , specifically farming , remains a hazardous industry , and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work - related injuries , lung disease , noise - induced hearing loss , skin diseases , as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure . on industrialized farms , injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery , and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers . pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can be hazardous to worker health , and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects . as an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself , entire families can be at risk for injuries , illness , and death . ages 0–6 may be an especially vulnerable population in agriculture ; common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning , machinery and motor accidents , including with all - terrain vehicles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the international labour organization considers agriculture " one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors " . it estimates that the annual work - related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170000 , twice the average rate of other jobs . in addition , incidences of death , injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported . the organization has developed the safety and health in agriculture convention , 2001 , which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation , the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the united states , agriculture has been identified by the national institute for occupational safety and health as a priority industry sector in the national occupational research agenda to identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the european union , the european agency for safety and health at work has issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in agriculture , livestock farming , horticulture , and forestry . the agricultural safety and health council of america ( ashca ) also holds a yearly summit to discuss safety . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break overall production varies by country as listed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints ; geography and climate of the farm ; government policy ; economic , social and political pressures ; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break shifting cultivation ( or slash and burn ) is a system in which forests are burnt , releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years . then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest , and the farmer moves to a new plot , returning after many more years ( 10–20 ) . this fallow period is shortened if population density grows , requiring the input of nutrients ( fertilizer or manure ) and some manual pest control . annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period . this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break further industrialization led to the use of monocultures , when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage . because of the low biodiversity , nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up , necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers . multiple cropping , in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year , and intercropping , when several crops are grown at the same time , are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in subtropical and arid environments , the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall , either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year , or requiring irrigation . in all of these environments perennial crops are grown ( coffee , chocolate ) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry . in temperate environments , where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie , highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break important categories of food crops include cereals , legumes , forage , fruits and vegetables . specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world . production is listed in millions of metric tons , based on fao estimates . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat , milk , eggs , or wool , and for work and transport . working animals , including horses , mules , oxen , water buffalo , camels , llamas , alpacas , donkeys , and dogs , have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields , harvest crops , wrangle other animals , and transport farm products to buyers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source , as grassland - based , mixed , and landless . , 30 of earths ice - and water - free area was used for producing livestock , with the sector employing approximately 1 billion people . between the 1960s and the 2000s , there was a significant increase in livestock production , both by numbers and by carcass weight , especially among beef , pigs and chickens , the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10 . non - meat animals , such as milk cows and egg - producing chickens , also showed significant production increases . global cattle , sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050 . aquaculture or fish farming , the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations , is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production , growing at an average of 9 a year between 1975 and 2007 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the second half of the 20th century , producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production , while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity . this trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds , leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland , rangeland , and pastures for feeding ruminant animals . outside nutrient inputs may be used , however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source . this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil , representing 30–40 million pastoralists . mixed production systems use grassland , fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric ( one stomach ; mainly chickens and pigs ) livestock . manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm , representing the de - linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in organisation for economic co - operation and development member countries . synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure use becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or harrow to prepare for planting , for nutrient incorporation , or for pest control . tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no - till . it may improve productivity by warming the soil , incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds , but also renders soil more prone to erosion , triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing co2 , and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pest control includes the management of weeds , insects , mites , and diseases . chemical ( pesticides ) , biological ( biocontrol ) , mechanical ( tillage ) , and cultural practices are used . cultural practices include crop rotation , culling , cover crops , intercropping , composting , avoidance , and resistance . integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss , and recommends pesticides as a last resort . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production , and the method of use of manure produced by livestock . nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers , manure , green manure , compost and minerals . crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period . manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing , such as in managed intensive rotational grazing , or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable , which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world . agriculture represents 70 of freshwater use worldwide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to a report by the international food policy research institute , agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other ; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity , food security and trade by 2050 , the international food policy research institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40 and food prices could be reduced by almost half . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break payment for ecosystem services is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment . measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city , to improve the supply of fresh water . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years , since the beginning of civilization . altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make - up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans , for example , larger fruits or seeds , drought - tolerance , or resistance to pests . significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel . his work on dominant and recessive alleles , although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years , gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques . crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits , self - pollination and cross - pollination , and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break domestication of plants has , over the centuries increased yield , improved disease resistance and drought tolerance , eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants . careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants . plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture ( grasses and clover ) in new zealand . extensive x - ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts ( that is primitive genetic engineering ) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat , corn ( maize ) and barley . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating " high - yielding varieties " . for example , average yields of corn ( maize ) in the us have increased from around 2 tons per hectare ( t / ha ) ( 40 bushels per acre ) in 1900 to about 9 t / ha ( 150 bushels per acre ) in 2001 . similarly , worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t / ha in 1900 to more than 2 t / ha in 1990 . south american average wheat yields are around 2 t / ha , african under 1 t / ha , and egypt and arabia up to 3 to 4 t / ha with irrigation . in contrast , the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over 8 t / ha . variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate , genetics , and the level of intensive farming techniques ( use of fertilizers , chemical pest control , growth control to avoid lodging ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break genetically modified organisms ( gmo ) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant dna technology . genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops . increased durability , nutritional content , insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering . for some , gmo crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns . numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production , import or use of gmo foods and crops . currently a global treaty , the biosafety protocol , regulates the trade of gmos . there is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from gmos , and while the eu currently requires all gmo foods to be labeled , the us does not . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break herbicide - resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides , including glyphosate . these seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop . herbicide - tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide . with the increasing use of herbicide - tolerant crops , comes an increase in the use of glyphosate - based herbicide sprays . in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed , causing farmers to switch to other herbicides . some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops , which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern , with potential economic and health implications . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other gmo crops used by growers include insect - resistant crops , which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis ( bt ) , which produces a toxin specific to insects . these crops resist damage by insects . some believe that similar or better pest - resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices , and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross - pollination with wild species . in some cases , wild species are the primary source of resistance traits ; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation , such as biodiversity loss , desertification , soil degradation and global warming , which cause decrease in crop yield . agriculture is one of the most important drivers of environmental pressures , particularly habitat change , climate change , water use and toxic emissions . agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment , including insecticides , especially those used on cotton . the 2011 unep green economy report stated that agricultural operations produced some 13 per cent of anthropogenic global greenhouse gas emissions . this includes gases from the use of inorganic fertilizers , agro - chemical pesticides , and herbicides , as well as fossil fuel - energy inputs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature ( especially herbicides and insecticides ) , nutrient runoff , excessive water usage , and loss of natural environment . a 2000 assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for 1996 of £2343 million , or £208 per hectare . a 2005 analysis of these costs in the us concluded that cropland imposes approximately 5 to 16 billion ( 30 to 96 per hectare ) , while livestock production imposes 714 million . both studies , which focused solely on the fiscal impacts , concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs . neither included subsidies in their analysis , but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs . yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens , predators , and competitors ( such as weeds ) . costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units , such as making fields larger ; this means removing hedges , ditches and other areas of habitat . pesticides kill insects , plants and fungi . these and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land . effective yields fall with on - farm losses , which may be caused by poor production practices during harvesting , handling , and storage . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a senior un official , henning steinfeld , said that " livestock are one of the most significant contributors to todays most serious environmental problems " . livestock production occupies 70 of all land used for agriculture , or 30 of the land surface of the planet . it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases , responsible for 18 of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions as measured in co2 equivalents . by comparison , all transportation emits 13 of the co2 . it produces 65 of human - related nitrous oxide ( which has 296 times the global warming potential of co2 ) and 37 of all human - induced methane ( which is 23 times as warming as co2 . it also generates 64 of the ammonia emission . livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation ; in the amazon basin 70 of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops . through deforestation and land degradation , livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity . furthermore , the unep states that " methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break land transformation , the use of land to yield goods and services , is the most substantial way humans alter the earths ecosystems , and is the driving force causing biodiversity loss . estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50 . land degradation , the long - term decline in ecosystem function and productivity , is estimated to be occurring on 24 of land worldwide , with cropland overrepresented . land management is the driving factor behind degradation ; 1 billion people rely upon the degrading land . degradation can be through deforestation , desertification , soil erosion , mineral depletion , acidification , or salinization . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break eutrophication , excessive nutrient enrichment in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia , leads to fish kills , loss of biodiversity , and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses . excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland , as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient ( mainly nitrogen and phosphorus ) runoff and leaching from agricultural land . these nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater , with harmful effects on human populations . fertilisers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light , favouring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources . agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers , and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate . it is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern china , the upper ganges and the western us are being depleted , and new research extends these problems to aquifers in iran , mexico and saudi arabia . increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas , meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the worlds growing population with reduced water resources . agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems , including the destruction of natural wetlands , the spread of water - borne diseases , and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging , when irrigation is performed incorrectly . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2 million short tons annually worldwide , yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant . the world health organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually , causing 220000 deaths . pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population , leading to a condition termed the " pesticide treadmill " in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an alternative argument is that the way to " save the environment " and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming , a view exemplified by a quote heading the center for global food issues website : ' growing more per acre leaves more land for nature ' . however , critics argue that a trade - off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable , and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agriculture , and in particular animal husbandry , is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions of co2 and a percentage of the worlds methane , and future land infertility , and the displacement of wildlife . agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases , and by the conversion of non - agricultural land such as forest for agricultural use . agriculture , forestry and land - use change contributed around 20 to 25 to global annual emissions in 2010 . a range of policies can reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on agriculture , and greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break current farming methods have resulted in over - stretched water resources , high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility . there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices ; therefore how critical water , land , and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered . a solution would be to give value to ecosystems , recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs , and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests . inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed , such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich , the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland , or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable . technology permits innovations like conservation tillage , a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion , reduces water pollution , and enhances carbon sequestration . other potential practices include conservation agriculture , agroforestry , improved grazing , avoided grassland conversion , and biochar . current mono - crop farming practices in the united states preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices , such as 2 - 3 crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops , unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the international food policy research institute states that agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other ; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity , food security and trade by 2050 , it found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40 and food prices could be reduced by almost half . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since the 1940s , agricultural productivity has increased dramatically , due largely to the increased use of energy - intensive mechanization , fertilizers and pesticides . the vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources . between the 1960s and the 1980s , the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe , with world grain production increasing significantly ( between 70 and 390 for wheat and 60 to 150 for rice , depending on geographic area ) as world population doubled . heavy reliance on petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break industrialized agriculture depends on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways : direct consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm . direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break indirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers , pesticides , and farm machinery . together , direct and indirect consumption by us farms accounts for about 2 of the nations energy use . direct and indirect energy consumption by farms peaked in 1979 , and has since gradually declined . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break plastic products are used extensively in agriculture , for example to increase crop yield and improve the efficiency of water and agrichemical use . “agriplastic” products include films to cover greenhouses and tunnels , mulch to cover soil ( for example to suppress weeds , conserve water , increase soil temperature and aid fertilizer application ) , shade cloth , pesticide containers , seedling trays , protective mesh and irrigation tubing . the polymers most commonly used in these products are low - density polyethylene ( lpde ) , linear low - density polyethylene ( lldpe ) , polypropylene ( pp ) and polyvinyl chloride ( pvc ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the total amount of plastics used in agriculture is difficult to quantify . a 2012 study reported that almost 6 million tonnes per year were consumed globally while a later study estimated that global demand in 2015 was between 7 million and 9 million tonnes . widespread use of plastic mulch and lack of systematic collection and management have led to the generation of large amounts of mulch residue . eathering and degradation eventually cause the mulch to fragment . these fragments and larger pieces of plastic accumulate in soil . mulch residue has been measured at levels of 50 to 260 kg per hectare in topsoil in areas where the mulch has been used for more than 10 years , which confirms that mulching is a major source of both microplastic and macroplastic contamination of soil . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agricultural plastics , especially plastic films , are not easy to recycle because of high contamination levels ( up to 40 - 50 by weight contamination by pesticides , fertilizers , soil and debris , moist vegetation , silage juice water , and uv stabilizers ) and collection difficulties . therefore , they are often buried or abandoned in fields and watercourses or burned . these disposal practices lead to soil degradation and can result in contamination of soils and leakage of microplastics into the marine environment as a result of precipitation run - off and tidal washing . in addition , additives in residual plastic film ( such as uv and thermal stabilizers ) may have deleterious effects on crop growth , soil structure , nutrient transport and salt levels . there is a risk that plastic mulch will deteriorate soil quality , deplete soil organic matter stocks , increase soil water repellence and emit greenhouse gases . microplastics released through fragmentation of agricultural plastics can absorb and concentrate contaminants capable of being passed up the trophic chain . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agricultural economics is economics as it relates to the " production , distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services " . combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s , and grew significantly through the 20th century . although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent , major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history , ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the post - american civil war southern united states to the european feudal system of manorialism . in the united states , and elsewhere , food costs attributed to food processing , distribution , and agricultural marketing , sometimes referred to as the value chain , have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined . this is related to the greater efficiency of farming , combined with the increased level of value addition ( for example more highly processed products ) provided by the supply chain . market concentration has increased in the sector as well , and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency , the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers ( farmers ) and consumers , and may have negative implications for rural communities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break national government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products , in the form of taxation , subsidies , tariffs and other measures . since at least the 1960s , a combination of trade restrictions , exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world . in the 1980s , non - subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products . between the mid - 1980s and the early 2000s , several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs , subsidies and other trade restrictions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however , , there was still a significant amount of policy - driven distortion in global agricultural product prices . the three agricultural products with the most trade distortion were sugar , milk and rice , mainly due to taxation . among the oilseeds , sesame had the most taxation , but overall , feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products . since the 1980s , policy - driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy . unprocessed commodities such as corn , soybeans , and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality , affecting the price the producer receives . commodities are generally reported by production quantities , such as volume , number or weight . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact , natural , economic and social sciences used in the practice and understanding of agriculture . it covers topics such as agronomy , plant breeding and genetics , plant pathology , crop modelling , soil science , entomology , production techniques and improvement , study of pests and their management , and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation , waste management , and bioremediation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the scientific study of agriculture began in the 18th century , when johann friedrich mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum ( hydrated calcium sulphate ) as a fertilizer . research became more systematic when in 1843 , john lawes and henry gilbert began a set of long - term agronomy field experiments at rothamsted research station in england ; some of them , such as the park grass experiment , are still running . in america , the hatch act of 1887 provided funding for what it was the first to call " agricultural science " , driven by farmers ' interest in fertilizers . in agricultural entomology , the usda began to research biological control in 1881 ; it instituted its first large program in 1905 , searching europe and japan for natural enemies of the gypsy moth and brown - tail moth , establishing parasitoids ( such as solitary wasps ) and predators of both pests in the usa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products . governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets . some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment ( including policies related to climate change , food safety and natural disasters ) , economic stability ( including policies related to taxes ) , natural resources and environmental sustainability ( especially water policy ) , research and development , and market access for domestic commodities ( including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries ) . agricultural policy can also touch on food quality , ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality , food security , ensuring that the food supply meets the populations needs , and conservation . policy programs can range from financial programs , such as subsidies , to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy , including consumers , agribusiness , trade lobbies and other groups . agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making , in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions . political action groups , including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions , also provide influence , as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities . the food and agriculture organization of the united nations ( fao ) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements . samuel jutzi , director of faos animal production and health division , states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment . for example , proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health , and environmental regulations , such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long - term damage , were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 40: Aldous Huxley ***********

aldous leonard huxley ( 26 july 1894 – 22 november 1963 ) was an english writer and philosopher . he wrote nearly 50 books—both novels and non - fiction works—as well as wide - ranging essays , narratives , and poems uvmr_ev_paragraph_break born into the prominent huxley family , he graduated from balliol college , oxford , with an undergraduate degree in english literature . early in his career , he published short stories and poetry and edited the literary magazine oxford poetry , before going on to publish travel writing , satire , and screenplays . he spent the latter part of his life in the united states , living in los angeles from 1937 until his death . by the end of his life , huxley was widely acknowledged as one of the foremost intellectuals of his time . he was nominated for the nobel prize in literature nine times and was elected companion of literature by the royal society of literature in 1962 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ' " companions ' , ' of ' , ' literature " ' . royal society of literature . retrieved 5 january 2015 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley was a pacifist . he grew interested in philosophical mysticism and universalism , addressing these subjects with works such as the perennial philosophy ( 1945 ) —which illustrates commonalities between western and eastern mysticism—and the doors of perception ( 1954 ) —which interprets his own psychedelic experience with mescaline . in his most famous novel brave new world ( 1932 ) and his final novel island ( 1962 ) , he presented his vision of dystopia and utopia , respectively . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley was born in godalming , surrey , england , in 1894 . he was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster leonard huxley , who edited the cornhill magazine , and his first wife , julia arnold , who founded priors field school . julia was the niece of poet and critic matthew arnold and the sister of mrs . humphry ward . julia named him aldous after a character in one of her sisters novels . aldous was the grandson of thomas henry huxley , the zoologist , agnostic , and controversialist ( " darwins bulldog " ) . his brother julian huxley and half - brother andrew huxley also became outstanding biologists . aldous had another brother , noel trevenen huxley ( 1889–1914 ) , who took his own life after a period of clinical depression . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a child , huxleys nickname was " ogie " , short for " ogre " . he was described by his brother , julian , as someone who frequently " contemplated the strangeness of things " . according to his cousin and contemporary , gervas huxley , he had an early interest in drawing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxleys education began in his fathers well - equipped botanical laboratory , after which he enrolled at hillside school near godalming . he was taught there by his own mother for several years until she became terminally ill . after hillside he went on to eton college . his mother died in 1908 , when he was 14 ( his father later remarried ) . he contracted the eye disease keratitis punctata in 1911 ; this " left him practically blind for two to three years " . this " ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor " . in october 1913 , huxley entered balliol college , oxford , where he studied english literature . his eyesight later partly recovered . he edited oxford poetry in 1916 , and in june of that year graduated ba with first class honours . his brother julian wrote : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following his years at balliol , huxley , being financially indebted to his father , decided to find employment . he taught french for a year at eton college , where eric blair ( who was to take the pen name george orwell ) and steven runciman were among his pupils . he was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class . nevertheless , blair and others spoke highly of his excellent command of language . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley also worked for a time during the 1920s at brunner and mond , an advanced chemical plant in billingham in county durham , northeast england . according to the introduction to the latest edition of his science fiction novel brave new world ( 1932 ) , the experience he had there of " an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence " was an important source for the novel . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley completed his first ( unpublished ) novel at the age of 17 and began writing seriously in his early twenties , establishing himself as a successful writer and social satirist . his first published novels were social satires , crome yellow ( 1921 ) , antic hay ( 1923 ) , those barren leaves ( 1925 ) , and point counter point ( 1928 ) . brave new world ( 1932 ) was his fifth novel and first dystopian work . in the 1920s , he was also a contributor to vanity fair and british vogue magazines . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the first world war , huxley spent much of his time at garsington manor near oxford , home of lady ottoline morrell , working as a farm labourer . while at the manor , he met several bloomsbury group figures , including bertrand russell , alfred north whitehead , and clive bell . later , in crome yellow ( 1921 ) , he caricatured the garsington lifestyle . jobs were very scarce , but in 1919 , john middleton murry was reorganising the athenaeum and invited huxley to join the staff . he accepted immediately , and quickly married the belgian refugee maria nys ( 1899–1955 ) , also at garsington . they lived with their young son in italy part of the time during the 1920s , where huxley would visit his friend lawrence . following lawrences death in 1930 , huxley edited lawrences letters ( 1932 ) . very early in 1929 , in london , huxley met gerald heard , a brilliant writer and broadcaster , philosopher and interpreter of contemporary science . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress , most famously brave new world , and on pacifist themes ( for example , eyeless in gaza ) . in brave new world , set in a dystopian london , huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and pavlovian conditioning . huxley was strongly influenced by matthias alexander , and included him as a character in eyeless in gaza ( 1936 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during this period , huxley began to write and edit non - fiction works on pacifist issues , including ends and means ( 1937 ) , an encyclopedia of pacifism , and pacifism and philosophy , and was an active member of the peace pledge union . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1937 , huxley moved to hollywood with his wife maria , son matthew huxley , and friend gerald heard . he lived in the , mainly in southern california , until his death , and also for a time in taos , new mexico , where he wrote ends and means ( published in 1937 ) . the book contains tracts on war , religion , nationalism , and ethics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break heard introduced huxley to vedanta ( upanishad - centered philosophy ) , meditation , and vegetarianism through the principle of ahimsa . in 1938 , huxley befriended jiddu krishnamurti , whose teachings he greatly admired . huxley and krishnamurti entered into an enduring exchange ( sometimes edging on debate ) over many years , with krishnamurti representing the more rarefied , detached , ivory - tower perspective and huxley , with his pragmatic concerns , the more socially and historically informed position . huxley provided an introduction to krishnamurtis quintessential statement , the first and last freedom ( 1954 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley also became a vedantist in the circle of hindu swami prabhavananda , and introduced christopher isherwood to this circle . not long afterwards , huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas , the perennial philosophy , which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world . huxleys book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted " five senses " and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley became a close friend of remsen bird , president of occidental college . he spent much time at the college , which is in the eagle rock neighbourhood of los angeles . the college appears as " tarzana college " in his satirical novel after many a summer ( 1939 ) . the novel won huxley a british literary award , the 1939 james tait black memorial prize for fiction . huxley also incorporated bird into the novel . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during this period , huxley earned a substantial income as a hollywood screenwriter ; christopher isherwood , in his autobiography my guru and his disciple , states that huxley earned more than 3000 per week ( approximately 50000 in 2020 dollars ) as a screenwriter , and that he used much of it to transport jewish and left - wing writer and artist refugees from hitlers germany to the us . in march 1938 , huxleys friend anita loos , a novelist and screenwriter , put him in touch with metro - goldwyn - mayer ( mgm ) , which hired him for madame curie which was originally to star greta garbo and be directed by george cukor . ( eventually , the film was completed by mgm in 1943 with a different director and cast . huxley received screen credit for pride and prejudice ( 1940 ) and was paid for his work on a number of other films , including jane eyre ( 1944 ) . he was commissioned by walt disney in 1945 to write a script based on alices adventures in wonderland and the biography of the storys author , lewis carroll . the script was not used , however . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of unwins 1940 book hopousia or the sexual and economic foundations of a new society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on 21 october 1949 , huxley wrote to george orwell , author of nineteen eighty - four , congratulating him on " how fine and how profoundly important the book is " . in his letter to orwell , he predicted : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1953 , huxley and maria applied for united states citizenship and presented themselves for examination . when huxley refused to bear arms for the and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals , the only excuse allowed under the mccarran act , the judge had to adjourn the proceedings . he withdrew his application . nevertheless , he remained in the in 1959 , huxley turned down an offer to be made a knight bachelor by the macmillan government without putting forward a reason ; his brother julian had been knighted in 1958 , while another brother andrew would be knighted in 1974 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the fall semester of 1960 huxley was invited by professor huston smith to be the carnegie visiting professor of humanities at the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) . ite magazinedate3 january 2017firstbarrylastboycemagazinelions roarurlhttps : / / www . ionsroar . om / huston - smith - fifty - years - on - the - razors - edgetitlehuston smiths fifty years on the razors edge uvmr_ev_paragraph_break biographer harold watts wrote that huxleys writings in the " final and extended period of his life " are " the work of a man who is meditating on the central problems of many modern men " . huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself . from these , he made some warnings in his writings and talks . in a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist mike wallace , huxley outlined several major concerns : the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation ; the tendency towards distinctly hierarchical social organisation ; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to persuasion ; the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well - marketed commodities . in a december 1962 letter to brother julian , summarizing a paper he had presented in santa barbara , he wrote , " what i said was that if we didnt pretty quickly start thinking of human problems in ecological terms rather than in terms of power politics we should very soon be in a bad way . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxleys engagement with eastern wisdom traditions was entirely compatible with a strong appreciation of modern science . biographer milton birnbaum wrote that huxley " ended by embracing both science and eastern religion " . in his last book , literature and science , huxley wrote that " the ethical and philosophical implications of modern science are more buddhist than christian . " in " a philosophers visionary prediction , " published one month before he died , huxley endorsed training in general semantics and " the nonverbal world of culturally uncontaminated consciousness , " writing that " we must learn how to be mentally silent , we must cultivate the art of pure receptivity . the individual must learn to decondition himself , must be able to cut holes in the fence of verbalized symbols that hems him in . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963 , huxley had an extensive association with the vedanta society of southern california , founded and headed by swami prabhavananda . together with gerald heard , christopher isherwood and other followers , he was initiated by the swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1944 , huxley wrote the introduction to the " bhagavad gita : the song of god " , translated by swami prabhavananda and christopher isherwood , which was published by the vedanta society of southern california . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 1941 until 1960 , huxley contributed 48 articles to vedanta and the west , published by the society . he also served on the editorial board with isherwood , heard , and playwright john van druten from 1951 through 1962 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley also occasionally lectured at the hollywood and santa barbara vedanta temples . two of those lectures have been released on cd : knowledge and understanding and who are we ? nonetheless , huxleys agnosticism , together with his speculative propensity , made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalised religion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the spring of 1953 , huxley had his first experience with the psychedelic drug mescaline . huxley had initiated a correspondence with doctor humphry osmond , a british psychiatrist then employed in a canadian institution , and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline ; osmond obliged and supervised huxleys session in southern california . after the publication of the doors of perception , in which he recounted this experience , huxley and swami prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience , which may have caused the relationship to cool , but huxley continued to write articles for the societys journal , lecture at the temple , and attend social functions . huxley later had an experience on mescaline that he considered more profound than those detailed in the doors of perception . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley wrote that " the mystical experience is doubly valuable ; it is valuable because it gives the experiencer a better understanding of himself and the world and because it may help him to lead a less self - centered and more creative life . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break having tried lsd in the 1950s , he became an advisor to timothy leary and richard alpert in their early - 1960s research work with psychedelic drugs at harvard . personality differences led huxley to distance himself from leary , when huxley grew concerned that leary had become too keen on promoting the drugs rather indiscriminately , even playing the rebel with a fondness for publicity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of huxleys eyesight at specific points in his life . circa 1939 , huxley encountered the bates method , in which he was instructed by margaret darst corbett . in 1940 , huxley relocated from hollywood to a 40 acre ranchito in the high desert hamlet of llano , california , in northern los angeles county . huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the bates method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern american desert . he reported that , for the first time in more than 25 years , he was able to read without glasses and without strain . he even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch . he wrote a book about his experiences with the bates method , the art of seeing , which was published in 1942 ( ) , 1943 ( uk ) . the book contained some generally disputed theories , and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about huxleys eyesight . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it was , and is , widely believed that huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens , despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at oxford . for example , some ten years after publication of the art of seeing , in 1952 , bennett cerf was present when huxley spoke at a hollywood banquet , wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty : " then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious . he wasnt reading his address at all . he had learned it by heart . to refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes . when it was only an inch or so away he still couldnt read it , and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him . it was an agonising moment . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break brazilian author joão ubaldo ribeiro , who as a young journalist spent several evenings in the huxleys ' company in the late 1950s , wrote that huxley had said to him , with a wry smile : " i can hardly see at all . and i dont give a damn , really . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on the other hand , huxleys second wife , laura archera , later emphasised in her biographical account , this timeless moment : " one of the great achievements of his life : that of having regained his sight . " after revealing a letter she wrote to the los angeles times disclaiming the label of huxley as a " poor fellow who can hardly see " by walter alvarez , she tempered her statement : " although i feel it was an injustice to treat aldous as though he were blind , it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision . for instance , although aldous did not wear glasses , he would quite often use a magnifying lens . " laura huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to huxleys vision . her account , in this respect , agrees with the following sample of huxleys own words from the art of seeing : " the most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism , or any part of the organism , is that it is not constant , but highly variable . " nevertheless , the topic of huxleys eyesight has continued to endure similar , significant controversy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break american popular science author steven johnson , in his book mind wide open , quotes huxley about his difficulties with visual encoding : " i am and , for as long as i can remember , i have always been a poor visualizer . words , even the pregnant words of poets , do not evoke pictures in my mind . no hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep . when i recall something , the memory does not present itself to me as a vividly seen event or object . by an effort of the will , i can evoke a not very vivid image of what happened yesterday afternoon " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley married on 10 july 1919 maria nys ( 10 september 1899 – 12 february 1955 ) , a belgian epidemiologist from bellem , in 1955 , maria huxley died of cancer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1956 , huxley married laura archera ( 1911–2007 ) , also an author , as well as a violinist and psychotherapist . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in 1960 ; in the years that followed , with his health deteriorating , he wrote the utopian novel island , and gave lectures on " human potentialities " both at the ucsf medical center and at the esalen institute . these lectures were fundamental to the beginning of the human potential movement . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley was a close friend of jiddu krishnamurti and rosalind rajagopal , and was involved in the creation of the happy valley school , now besant hill school , of happy valley , in ojai , california . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the most substantial collection of huxleys few remaining papers , following the destruction of most in the 1961 bel air fire , is at the library of the university of california , los angeles . some are also at the stanford university libraries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on 9 april 1962 huxley was informed he was elected companion of literature by the royal society of literature , the senior literary organisation in britain , and he accepted the title via letter on 28 april 1962 . the correspondence between huxley and the society is kept at the cambridge university library . the society invited huxley to appear at a banquet and give a lecture at somerset house , london , in june 1963 . huxley wrote a draft of the speech he intended to give at the society ; however , his deteriorating health meant he was not able to attend . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on his deathbed , unable to speak owing to advanced laryngeal cancer , huxley made a written request to his wife laura for " lsd , 100 µg , intramuscular . " according to her account of his death in this timeless moment , she obliged with an injection at 11 : 20a . . and a second dose an hour later ; huxley died aged 69 , at 5 : 20p . . ( los angeles time ) , on 22 november 1963 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break media coverage of huxleys death , along with that of fellow british author lewis , was overshadowed by the assassination of american president john kennedy on the same day , less than seven hours before huxleys death . in a 2009 article for new york magazine titled " the eclipsed celebrity death club " , christopher bonanos wrote : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this coincidence served as the basis for peter kreefts book between heaven and hell : a dialog somewhere beyond death with john kennedy , lewis , aldous huxley , which imagines a conversation among the three men taking place in purgatory following their deaths . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxleys memorial service took place in london in december 1963 ; it was led by his elder brother julian . on 27 october 1971 , his ashes were interred in the family grave at the watts cemetery , home of the watts mortuary chapel in compton , guildford , surrey , england . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break huxley had been a long - time friend of russian composer igor stravinsky , who dedicated his last orchestral composition to huxley . what became variations : aldous huxley in memoriam was begun in july 1963 , completed in october 1964 , and premiered by the chicago symphony orchestra on 17 april 1965 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break algae ( ; singular alga ) is an informal term for a large and diverse group of photosynthetic eukaryotic organisms it is a polyphyletic grouping that includes species from multiple distinct clades . included organisms range from unicellular microalgae , such as chlorella , prototheca and the diatoms , to multicellular forms , such as the giant kelp , a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length . most are aquatic and autotrophic ( they generate food internally ) and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types , such as stomata , xylem and phloem that are found in land plants . the largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds , while the most complex freshwater forms are the charophyta , a division of green algae which includes , for example , spirogyra and stoneworts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break no definition of algae is generally accepted . one definition is that algae " have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells " . likewise , the colorless prototheca under chlorophyta are all devoid of any chlorophyll . although cyanobacteria are often referred to as " blue - green algae " , most authorities exclude all prokaryotes from the definition of algae . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break algae constitute a polyphyletic group they were acquired in different ways . green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria . diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic red alga . algae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies , from simple asexual cell division to complex forms of sexual reproduction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants , such as the phyllids ( leaf - like structures ) of bryophytes , rhizoids of nonvascular plants , and the roots , leaves , and other organs found in tracheophytes ( vascular plants ) . most are phototrophic , although some are mixotrophic , deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy , myzotrophy , or phagotrophy . some unicellular species of green algae , many golden algae , euglenids , dinoflagellates , and other algae have become heterotrophs ( also called colorless or apochlorotic algae ) , sometimes parasitic , relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus . some other heterotrophic organisms , such as the apicomplexans , are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids , but are not traditionally considered as algae . algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a by - product of photosynthesis , unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple and green sulfur bacteria . fossilized filamentous algae from the vindhya basin have been dated back to 1 to 1billion years ago . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break because of the wide range of types of algae , they have increasing different industrial and traditional applications in human society . traditional seaweed farming practices have existed for thousands of years and have strong traditions in east asia food cultures . more modern algaculture applications extend the food traditions for other applications include cattle feed , using algae for bioremediation or pollution control , transforming sunlight into algae fuels or other chemicals used in industrial processes , and in medical and scientific applications . a 2020 review found that these applications of algae could play an important role in carbon sequestration in order to mitigate climate change while providing valuable value - add products for global economies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the singular alga is the latin word for ' seaweed ' and retains that meaning in english . the etymology is obscure . although some speculate that it is related to latin algēre , ' be cold ' , no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature . a more likely source is alliga , ' binding , entwining ' . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ancient greek word for ' seaweed ' was φῦκος ( phŷkos ) , which could mean either the seaweed ( probably red algae ) or a red dye derived from it . the latinization , fūcus , meant primarily the cosmetic rouge . the etymology is uncertain , but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the biblical פוך ( pūk ) , ' paint ' ( if not that word itself ) , a cosmetic eye - shadow used by the ancient egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern mediterranean . it could be any color : black , red , green , or blue . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break accordingly , the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology , depending on whether the greek or latin root is used . the name fucus appears in a number of taxa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the committee on the international code of botanical nomenclature has recommended certain suffixes for use in the classification of algae . these are - phyta for division , - phyceae for class , - phycideae for subclass , - ales for order , - inales for suborder , - aceae for family , - oidease for subfamily , a greek - based name for genus , and a latin - based name for species . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the primary classification of algae is based on certain morphological features . the chief among these are ( a ) pigment constitution of the cell , ( b ) chemical nature of stored food materials , ( c ) kind , number , point of insertion and relative length of the flagella on the motile cell , ( d ) chemical composition of cell wall and ( e ) presence or absence of a definitely organized nucleus in the cell or any other significant details of cell structure . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although carolus linnaeus ( 1754 ) included algae along with lichens in his 25th class cryptogamia , he did not elaborate further on the classification of algae . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break jean pierre étienne vaucher ( 1803 ) was perhaps the first to propose a system of classification of algae , and he recognized three groups , conferves , ulves , and tremelles . while johann heinrich friedrich link ( 1820 ) classified algae on the basis of the colour of the pigment and structure , william henry harvey ( 1836 ) proposed a system of classification on the basis of the habitat and the pigment . agardh ( 1849–1898 ) divided algae into six orders : diatomaceae , nostochineae , confervoideae , ulvaceae , floriadeae and fucoideae . around 1880 , algae along with fungi were grouped under thallophyta , a division created by eichler ( 1836 ) . encouraged by this , adolf engler and karl prantl ( 1912 ) proposed a revised scheme of classification of algae and included fungi in algae as they were of opinion that fungi have been derived from algae . the scheme proposed by engler and prantl is summarised as follows : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria . chloroplasts contain circular dna like that in cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria . however , the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae , reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events . the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae . their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right . many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic . some retain plastids , but not chloroplasts , while others have lost plastids entirely . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break phylogeny based on plastid not nucleocytoplasmic genealogy : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break these groups have green chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and b . their chloroplasts are surrounded by four and three membranes , respectively , and were probably retained from ingested green algae . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break chlorarachniophytes , which belong to the phylum cercozoa , contain a small nucleomorph , which is a relict of the algaes nucleus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break euglenids , which belong to the phylum euglenozoa , live primarily in fresh water and have chloroplasts with only three membranes . the endosymbiotic green algae may have been acquired through myzocytosis rather than phagocytosis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break these groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and c , and phycobilins . the shape can vary ; they may be of discoid , plate - like , reticulate , cup - shaped , spiral , or ribbon shaped . they have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch . the latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts , but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the first three of these groups ( chromista ) , the chloroplast has four membranes , retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads , and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor , although other evidence casts doubt on whether the heterokonts , haptophyta , and cryptomonads are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes , but considerable diversity exists in chloroplasts within the group , and a number of endosymbiotic events apparently occurred . the apicomplexa , a group of closely related parasites , also have plastids called apicoplasts , which are not photosynthetic , but appear to have a common origin with dinoflagellate chloroplasts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break linnaeus , in species plantarum ( 1753 ) , the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature , recognized 14 genera of algae , of which only four are currently considered among algae . in systema naturae , linnaeus described the genera volvox and corallina , and a species of acetabularia ( as madrepora ) , among the animals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1768 , samuel gottlieb gmelin ( 1744–1774 ) published the historia fucorum , the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of linnaeus . it included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break w . harvey ( 1811–1866 ) and lamouroux ( 1813 ) were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation . this is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics . harveys four divisions are : red algae ( rhodospermae ) , brown algae ( melanospermae ) , green algae ( chlorospermae ) , and diatomaceae . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at this time , microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers ( for example , müller and ehrenberg ) studying the infusoria ( microscopic organisms ) . unlike macroalgae , which were clearly viewed as plants , microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although used as a taxonomic category in some pre - darwinian classifications , for example , linnaeus ( 1753 ) , de jussieu ( 1789 ) , horaninow ( 1843 ) , agassiz ( 1859 ) , wilson cassin ( 1864 ) , in further classifications , the " algae " are seen as an artificial , polyphyletic group . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break throughout the 20th century , most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae : cyanophytes , rhodophytes , chrysophytes , xanthophytes , bacillariophytes , phaeophytes , pyrrhophytes ( cryptophytes and dinophytes ) , euglenophytes , and chlorophytes . later , many new groups were discovered ( for example , bolidophyceae ) , and others were splintered from older groups : charophytes and glaucophytes ( from chlorophytes ) , many heterokontophytes ( for example , synurophytes from chrysophytes , or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes ) , haptophytes ( from chrysophytes ) , and chlorarachniophytes ( from xanthophytes ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the abandonment of plant - animal dichotomous classification , most groups of algae ( sometimes all ) were included in protista , later also abandoned in favour of eukaryota . however , as a legacy of the older plant life scheme , some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications ( see ambiregnal protists ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some parasitic algae ( for example , the green algae prototheca and helicosporidium , parasites of metazoans , or cephaleuros , parasites of plants ) were originally classified as fungi , sporozoans , or protistans of incertae sedis , while others ( for example , the green algae phyllosiphon and rhodochytrium , parasites of plants , or the red algae pterocladiophila and gelidiocolax mammillatus , parasites of other red algae , or the dinoflagellates oodinium , parasites of fish ) had their relationship with algae conjectured early . in other cases , some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae ( for example , chlorochytrium ) , but later were seen as endophytic algae . some filamentous bacteria ( for example , beggiatoa ) were originally seen as algae . furthermore , groups like the apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids , but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first land plants probably evolved from shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like chara almost 500million years ago . these probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations and were probably filamentous . fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as 475million years ago . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a range of algal morphologies is exhibited , and convergence of features in unrelated groups is common . the only groups to exhibit three - dimensional multicellular thalli are the reds and browns , and some chlorophytes . apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups : the florideophyte reds , various browns , and the charophytes . the form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns , because they have distinct nodes , separated by internode ' stems ' ; whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes . conceptacles are another polyphyletic trait ; they appear in the coralline algae and the hildenbrandiales , as well as the browns . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids , but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups . some of the more common organizational levels , more than one of which may occur in the lifecycle of a species , are uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in three lines , even higher levels of organization have been reached , with full tissue differentiation . these are the brown algae , —some of which may reach 50m in length ( kelps ) —the red algae , and the green algae . the most complex forms are found among the charophyte algae ( see charales and charophyta ) , in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants . the innovation that defines these nonalgal plants is the presence of female reproductive organs with protective cell layers that protect the zygote and developing embryo . hence , the land plants are referred to as the embryophytes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term algal turf is commonly used but poorly defined . algal turfs are thick , carpet - like beds of seaweed that retain sediment and compete with foundation species like corals and kelps , and they are usually less than 15cm tall . such a turf may consist of one or more species , and will generally cover an area in the order of a square metre or more . some common characteristics are listed : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many algae , particularly members of the characeae species , have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes , osmoregulation , turgor regulation , salt tolerance , cytoplasmic streaming , and the generation of action potentials . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break phytohormones are found not only in higher plants , but in algae , too . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some species of algae form symbiotic relationships with other organisms in these symbioses , the algae supply photosynthates ( organic substances ) to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells . the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae . examples are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lichens are defined by the international association for lichenology to be " an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure " . the fungi , or mycobionts , are mainly from the ascomycota with a few from the basidiomycota . in nature they do not occur separate from lichens . it is unknown when they began to associate . one mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species , rarely two , from the green algae , except that alternatively , the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria ( hence " photobiont " is the more accurate term ) . a photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live independently ; accordingly , lichens are named and classified as fungal species . the association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone ( they can be experimentally isolated ) . the photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiont . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break trentepohlia is an example of a common green alga genus worldwide that can grow on its own or be lichenised . lichen thus share some of the habitat and often similar appearance with specialized species of algae ( aerophytes ) growing on exposed surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks and sometimes discoloring them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break endosymbiontic green algae live close to the surface of some sponges , for example , breadcrumb sponges ( halichondria panicea ) . the alga is thus protected from predators ; the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for 50 to 80 of sponge growth in some species . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rhodophyta , chlorophyta , and heterokontophyta , the three main algal divisions , have lifecycles which show considerable variation and complexity . in general , an asexual phase exists where the seaweeds cells are diploid , a sexual phase where the cells are haploid , followed by fusion of the male and female gametes . asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases , but less variation is possible . commonly , in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae , two specialized , sexually compatible , haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a zygote . to ensure a successful mating , the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and regulated ; pheromones may play a key role in these processes . sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of dna damages during meiosis , a key stage of the sexual cycle . however , sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction . meiosis has been shown to occur in many different species of algae . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the algal collection of the us national herbarium ( located in the national museum of natural history ) consists of approximately 320500 dried specimens , which , although not exhaustive ( no exhaustive collection exists ) , gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species ( that number remains unknown ) . estimates vary widely . for example , according to one standard textbook , in the british isles the uk biodiversity steering group report estimated there to be 20000 algal species in the uk . another checklist reports only about 5000 species . regarding the difference of about 15000 species , the text concludes : " it will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of species " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break regional and group estimates have been made , as well : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break and so on , but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources , these numbers have no more credibility than the british ones mentioned above . most estimates also omit microscopic algae , such as phytoplankton . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the most recent estimate suggests 72500 algal species worldwide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the mid - 19th century . algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of plantae by seeds and spores . this dispersal can be accomplished by air , water , or other organisms due to this , spores can be found in a variety of environments : fresh and marine waters , air , soil , and in or on other organisms whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind , as well as by living carriers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to some degree , the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features , such as antarctica , long distances of ocean or general land masses . it is , therefore , possible to identify species occurring by locality , such as " pacific algae " or " north sea algae " . when they occur out of their localities , hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible , such as the hulls of ships . for example , ulva reticulata and fasciata travelled from the mainland to hawaii in this manner . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mapping is possible for select species only : " there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns . " for example , clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there . however , scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the " difficulties of undertaking such studies . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break algae are prominent in bodies of water , common in terrestrial environments , and are found in unusual environments , such as on snow and ice . seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters , under 100 m deep ; however , some such as navicula pennata have been recorded to a depth of 360 m . a type of algae , ancylonema nordenskioeldii , was found in greenland in areas known as the ' dark zone ' , which caused an increase in the rate of melting ice sheet . same algae was found in the italian alps , after pink ice appeared on parts of the presena glacier . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology . microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column ( phytoplankton ) provide the food base for most marine food chains . in very high densities ( algal blooms ) , these algae may discolor the water and outcompete , poison , or asphyxiate other life forms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break algae can be used as indicator organisms to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems in many cases , algal metabolism is sensitive to various pollutants . due to this , the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants . to detect these changes , algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on the basis of their habitat , algae can be categorized as : aquatic ( planktonic , benthic , marine , freshwater , lentic , lotic ) , terrestrial , aerial ( subaerial ) , lithophytic , halophytic ( or euryhaline ) , psammon , thermophilic , cryophilic , epibiont ( epiphytic , epizoic ) , endosymbiont ( endophytic , endozoic ) , parasitic , calcifilic or lichenic ( phycobiont ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in classical chinese , the word 藻 is used both for " algae " and ( in the modest tradition of the imperial scholars ) for " literary talent " . the third island in kunming lake beside the summer palace in beijing is known as the zaojian tang dao , which thus simultaneously means " island of the algae - viewing hall " and " island of the hall for reflecting on literary talent " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agar , a gelatinous substance derived from red algae , has a number of commercial uses . it is a good medium on which to grow bacteria and fungi , as most microorganisms cannot digest agar . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alginic acid , or alginate , is extracted from brown algae . its uses range from gelling agents in food , to medical dressings . alginic acid also has been used in the field of biotechnology as a biocompatible medium for cell encapsulation and cell immobilization . molecular cuisine is also a user of the substance for its gelling properties , by which it becomes a delivery vehicle for flavours . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break between 100000 and 170000 wet tons of macrocystis are harvested annually in new mexico for alginate extraction and abalone feed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to be competitive and independent from fluctuating support from ( local ) policy on the long run , biofuels should equal or beat the cost level of fossil fuels . here , algae - based fuels hold great promise , directly related to the potential to produce more biomass per unit area in a year than any other form of biomass . the break - even point for algae - based biofuels is estimated to occur by 2025 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for centuries , seaweed has been used as a fertilizer ; george owen of henllys writing in the 16th century referring to drift weed in south wales : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break today , algae are used by humans in many ways ; for example , as fertilizers , soil conditioners , and livestock feed . aquatic and microscopic species are cultured in clear tanks or ponds and are either harvested or used to treat effluents pumped through the ponds . algaculture on a large scale is an important type of aquaculture in some places . maerl is commonly used as a soil conditioner . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break naturally growing seaweeds are an important source of food , especially in asia , leading some to label them as superfoods . they provide many vitamins including : a , b1 , b2 , b6 , niacin , and c , and are rich in iodine , potassium , iron , magnesium , and calcium . in addition , commercially cultivated microalgae , including both algae and cyanobacteria , are marketed as nutritional supplements , such as spirulina , chlorella and the vitamin - c supplement from dunaliella , high in beta - carotene . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break algae are national foods of many nations : china consumes more than 70 species , including fat choy , a cyanobacterium considered a vegetable ; japan , over 20 species such as nori and aonori ; ireland , dulse ; chile , cochayuyo . laver is used to make laver bread in wales , where it is known as bara lawr ; in korea , gim . it is also used along the west coast of north america from california to british columbia , in hawaii and by the māori of new zealand . sea lettuce and badderlocks are salad ingredients in scotland , ireland , greenland , and iceland . algae is being considered a potential solution for world hunger problem . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break two popular forms of algae are used in cuisine : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break furthermore , it contains all nine of the essential amino acids the body does not produce on its own uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the oils from some algae have high levels of unsaturated fatty acids . for example , parietochloris incisa is very high in arachidonic acid , where it reaches up to 47 of the triglyceride pool . some varieties of algae favored by vegetarianism and veganism contain the long - chain , essential omega - 3 fatty acids , docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ) and eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) . fish oil contains the omega - 3 fatty acids , but the original source is algae ( microalgae in particular ) , which are eaten by marine life such as copepods and are passed up the food chain . algae have emerged in recent years as a popular source of omega - 3 fatty acids for vegetarians who cannot get long - chain epa and dha from other vegetarian sources such as flaxseed oil , which only contains the short - chain alpha - linolenic acid ( ala ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agricultural research service scientists found that 60–90 of nitrogen runoff and 70–100 of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber , also called an algal turf scrubber ( ats ) . scientists developed the ats , which consists of shallow , 100 - foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form , and studied its efficacy for three years . they found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers , streams , and oceans . researchers collected and dried the nutrient - rich algae from the ats and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer . they found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ats organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers . algae scrubbers , using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions , are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break various polymers can be created from algae , which can be especially useful in the creation of bioplastics . these include hybrid plastics , cellulose - based plastics , poly - lactic acid , and bio - polyethylene . several companies have begun to produce algae polymers commercially , including for use in flip - flops and in surf boards . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alga stichococcus bacillaris has been seen to colonize silicone resins used at archaeological sites ;

*********** Article 44: Analysis of variance ***********

analysis of variance ( anova ) is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures ( such as the " variation " among and between groups ) used to analyze the differences among means . anova was developed by the statistician ronald fisher . anova is based on the law of total variance , where the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation . in its simplest form , anova provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal , and therefore generalizes the t - test beyond two means . in other words , the anova is used to test the difference between two or more means . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century , antecedents extend centuries into the past according to stigler . these include hypothesis testing , the partitioning of sums of squares , experimental techniques and the additive model . laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s . around 1800 , laplace and gauss developed the least - squares method for combining observations , which improved upon methods then used in astronomy and geodesy . it also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares . laplace knew how to estimate a variance from a residual ( rather than a total ) sum of squares . by 1827 , laplace was using least squares methods to address anova problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides . before 1800 , astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from reaction times ( the " personal equation " ) and had developed methods of reducing the errors . the experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology which developed strong ( full factorial ) experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added . an eloquent non - mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was available in 1885 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ronald fisher introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis in a 1918 article the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance . his first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921 . analysis of variance became widely known after being included in fishers 1925 book statistical methods for research workers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break randomization models were developed by several researchers . the first was published in polish by jerzy neyman in 1923 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the illustrations to the right , groups are identified as x1 , x2 , etcetera in the first illustration , the dogs are divided according to the product ( interaction ) of two binary groupings : young vs old , and short - haired vs long - haired ( for example , group 1 is young , short - haired dogs , group 2 is young , long - haired dogs , etcetera ) . since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups ( shown in blue ) has a relatively large variance , and since the means are very similar across groups , grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights : knowing which group a dog is in doesnt allow us to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the dog is in a dog show . thus , this grouping fails to explain the variation in the overall distribution ( yellow - orange ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as pet vs working breed and less athletic vs more athletic would probably be somewhat more successful ( fair fit ) . the heaviest show dogs are likely to be big , strong , working breeds , while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter . as shown by the second illustration , the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case , and the means are more distinguishable . however , the significant overlap of distributions , for example , means that we cannot distinguish x1 and x2 reliably . grouping dogs according to a coin flip might produce distributions that look similar . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit . all chihuahuas are light and all st bernards are heavy . the difference in weights between setters and pointers does not justify separate breeds . the analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments . a common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models . the method has some advantages over correlation : not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance , and these are outlined here . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the fixed - effects model ( class i ) of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the response variable values change . this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break random - effects model ( class ii ) is used when the treatments are not fixed . this occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population . because the levels themselves are random variables , some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments ( a multi - variable generalization of simple differences ) differ from the fixed - effects model . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a mixed - effects model ( class iii ) contains experimental factors of both fixed and random - effects types , with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break example : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break teaching experiments could be performed by a college or university department to find a good introductory textbook , with each text considered a treatment . the fixed - effects model would compare a list of candidate texts . the random - effects model would determine whether important differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts . the mixed - effects model would compare the ( fixed ) incumbent texts to randomly selected alternatives . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive , with competing definitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches , the most common of which uses a linear model that relates the response to the treatments and blocks . note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels . interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a linear model , which makes the following assumptions about the probability distribution of the responses : cite book title statistical methods uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the errors are independently , identically , and normally distributed for fixed effects models , that is , that the errors ( varepsilon ) are independent and uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a randomized controlled experiment , the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units , following the experimental protocol . this randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out . the objective random - assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis , following the ideas of peirce and ronald fisher . this design - based analysis was discussed and developed by francis anscombe at rothamsted experimental station and by oscar kempthorne at iowa state university . kempthorne and his students make an assumption of unit treatment additivity , which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and david cox . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in its simplest form , the assumption of unit - treatment additivity states that the observed response yi , j from experimental unit i when receiving treatment j can be written as the sum of the units response yi and the treatment - effect tj , that is uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the assumption of unit - treatment additivity implies that , for every treatment j , the jth treatment has exactly the same effect tj on every experiment unit . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the assumption of unit treatment additivity usually cannot be directly falsified , according to cox and kempthorne . however , many consequences of treatment - unit additivity can be falsified . for a randomized experiment , the assumption of unit - treatment additivity implies that the variance is constant for all treatments . therefore , by contraposition , a necessary condition for unit - treatment additivity is that the variance is constant . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design - based inference that is standard in finite - population survey sampling . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break kempthorne uses the randomization - distribution and the assumption of unit treatment additivity to produce a derived linear model , very similar to the textbook model discussed previously . inkelmann and kempthorne ( 2008 , volume 1 , section 6 : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break completely randomized design ; derived linear model ) the test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model , according to approximation theorems and simulation studies . however , there are differences . for example , the randomization - based analysis results in a small but ( strictly ) negative correlation between the observations . in the randomization - based analysis , there is no assumption of a normal distribution and certainly no assumption of independence . on the contrary , the observations are dependent ! uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the randomization - based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time . since the randomization - based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model , most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach . few statisticians object to model - based analysis of balanced randomized experiments . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however , when applied to data from non - randomized experiments or observational studies , model - based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break kempthorne ( 1979 , pp 125–126 , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " the experimenter must decide which of the various causes that he feels will produce variations in his results must be controlled uvmr_ev_paragraph_break experimentally . those causes that he does not control experimentally , because he is not cognizant of them , he must control by the device of randomization . " " only when the treatments in the experiment are applied by the experimenter using the full randomization procedure is the chain of inductive inference sound . it is only under these circumstances that the experimenter can attribute whatever effects he observes to the treatment and the treatment only . under these circumstances his conclusions are reliable in the statistical sense . " ) uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for observational data , the derivation of confidence intervals must use subjective models , as emphasized by ronald fisher and his followers . in practice , the estimates of treatment - effects from observational studies generally are often inconsistent . in practice , " statistical models " and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the normal - model based anova analysis assumes the independence , normality , and homogeneity of variances of the residuals . the randomization - based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the variances of the residuals ( as a consequence of unit - treatment additivity ) and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment . both these analyses require homoscedasticity , as an assumption for the normal - model analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization - based analysis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however , studies of processes that change variances rather than means ( called dispersion effects ) have been successfully conducted using anova . there are no necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality , but the f - test used for anova hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical uvmr_ev_paragraph_break limitations which are of continuing interest . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the property of unit - treatment additivity is not invariant under a " change of scale " , so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit - treatment additivity . if the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions , then the statistician may specify ( in the protocol for the experiment or observational study ) that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance . also , a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses , which are believed to follow a multiplicative model . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to cauchys functional equation theorem , the logarithm is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anova is used in the analysis of comparative experiments , those in which only the difference in outcomes is of interest . the statistical significance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two variances . this ratio is independent of several possible alterations to the experimental observations : adding a constant to all observations does not alter significance . multiplying all observations by a constant does not alter significance . so anova statistical significance result is independent of constant bias and scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations . in the era of mechanical calculation it was common to subtract a constant from all observations ( when equivalent to dropping leading digits ) to simplify data entry . this is an example of data coding . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the calculations of anova can be characterized as computing a number of means and variances , dividing two variances and comparing the ratio to a handbook value to determine statistical significance . calculating a treatment effect is then trivial : " the effect of any treatment is estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the observations which receive the treatment and the general mean " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anova uses traditional standardized terminology . the definitional equation of sample variance is s2 frac1n - 1 sumi ( yi - bary ) 2 , where the divisor is called the degrees of freedom ( df ) , the summation is called uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the sum of squares ( ss ) , the result is called the mean square ( ms ) and the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean . anova estimates 3 sample variances : a total variance based on all the observation deviations from the grand mean , an error variance based on all the observation deviations from their appropriate treatment means , and a treatment variance . the treatment variance is based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean , the result being multiplied by the number of observations in each treatment to account for the difference between the variance of observations and the variance of means . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares ss into components related to the effects used in the model . for example , the model for a simplified anova with one type of treatment at different levels . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the number of degrees of freedom df can be partitioned in a similar way : one of these components ( that for error ) specifies a chi - squared distribution which describes the associated sum of squares , while the same is true for " treatments " if there is no treatment effect . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break see also lack - of - fit sum of squares . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the f - test is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation . for example , in one - way , or single - factor anova , statistical significance is tested for by comparing the f test statistic uvmr_ev_paragraph_break where ms is mean square , i is the number of treatments and nt is the total number of cases uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to the f - distribution with i - 1 , nt - i degrees of freedom . using the f - distribution is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled chi - squared distribution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the expected value of f is 1 n sigma2texttreatment / sigma2texterror ( where n is the treatment sample size ) which is 1 for no treatment effect . as values of f increase above 1 , the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis . two apparent experimental methods of increasing f are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are two methods of concluding the anova hypothesis test , both of which produce the same result : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the anova f - test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors ( that is maximizing power for a fixed significance level ) . for example , to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect , the f - tests p - values closely approximate the permutation tests p - values : the approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced . such permutation tests characterize tests with maximum power against all alternative hypotheses , as observed by rosenbaum . the anova f - test ( of the null - hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect ) is recommended as a practical test , because of its robustness against many alternative distributions . he f - test for the comparison of variances has a mixed reputation . it uvmr_ev_paragraph_break is not recommended as a hypothesis test to determine whether two different samples have the same variance . it is recommended for anova where two estimates of the variance of the same sample are compared . while the f - test is not generally robust against departures from normality , it has been found to be robust in the special case of anova . citations from moore mccabe ( 2003 ) : " analysis of variance uses f statistics , but these are not the same as the f statistic for comparing two population standard deviations . " ( page 554 ) " the f test and other procedures for inference about variances are so lacking in robustness as to be of little use in practice . " ( page 556 ) " ' anova ' , " f - test " is relatively insensitive to moderate nonnormality and unequal variances , especially when the sample sizes are similar . " ( page 763 ) anova assumes homoscedasticity , but it is robust . the statistical test for homoscedasticity ( the f - test ) is not robust . moore mccabe recommend a rule of thumb . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anova consists of separable parts ; partitioning sources of variance and hypothesis testing can be used individually . anova is used to support other statistical tools . regression is first used to fit more complex models to data , then anova is used to compare models with the objective of selecting simple ( r ) models that adequately describe the data . " such models could be fit without any reference to anova , but anova tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models , and to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients . " " we think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring multilevel models—not as an alternative to regression but as a tool for summarizing complex high - dimensional inferences " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the simplest experiment suitable for anova analysis is the completely randomized experiment with a single factor . more complex experiments with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include completely randomized blocks and latin squares ( and variants : graeco - latin squares , etcetera ) . the more complex experiments share many of the complexities of multiple factors . a relatively complete discussion of the analysis ( models , data summaries , anova table ) of the completely randomized experiment is available . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are some alternatives to conventional one - way analysis of variance , for example : welchs heteroscedastic f test , welchs heteroscedastic f test with trimmed means and winsorized variances , brown - forsythe test , alexander - govern test , james second order test and kruskal - wallis test , available in ' onewaytests ' r uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is useful to represent each data point in the following form , called a statistical model : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break where uvmr_ev_paragraph_break that is , we envision an additive model that says every data point can be represented by summing three quantities : the true mean , averaged over all factor levels being investigated , plus an incremental component associated with the particular column ( factor level ) , plus a final component associated with everything else affecting that specific data value . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anova generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors . when the experiment includes observations at all combinations of levels of each factor , it is termed factorial . factorial experiments are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the efficiency grows as the number of factors increases . ontgomery uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ( 2001 , section 5 - 2 : introduction to factorial designs ; the advantages of factorials ) consequently , factorial designs are heavily used . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the use of anova to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication . in a 3 - way anova with factors x , y and z , the anova model includes terms for the main effects ( x , y , z ) and terms for interactions ( xy , xz , yz , xyz ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all terms require hypothesis tests . the proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance . fortunately , experience says that high order interactions are rare . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple factor anova . testing one factor at a time hides interactions , but produces apparently inconsistent experimental results . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break caution is advised when encountering interactions ; test interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond anova if interactions are found . texts vary in their recommendations regarding the continuation of the anova procedure after encountering an interaction . interactions complicate the interpretation of experimental data . neither the calculations of significance nor the estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value . " a significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects . " graphical methods are recommended to enhance understanding . regression is often useful . a lengthy discussion of interactions is available in cox ( 1958 ) . some interactions can be removed ( by transformations ) while others cannot . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a variety of techniques are used with multiple factor anova to reduce expense . one technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication ( possibly no replication with support of analytical trickery ) and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically ( or practically ) insignificant . an experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some analysis is required in support of the design of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses . because experimentation is iterative , the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the design of an experiment , the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment . experimentation is often sequential . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break early experiments are often designed to provide mean - unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error . later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude ; in this case , the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power , among other goals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology . " provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions . " the analysis , which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted , is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break besides the power analysis , there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units . these include graphical methods based on limiting the probability of false negative errors , graphical methods based on an expected variation increase ( above the residuals ) and methods based on achieving a desired confidence interval . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break power analysis is often applied in the context of anova in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain anova design , effect size in the population , sample size and significance level . power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for anova to summarize the strength of the association between a predictor ( s ) and the dependent variable or the overall standardized difference of the complete model . standardized effect - size estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines . however , while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature , a non - standardized measure of effect size that has immediately " meaningful " units may be preferable for reporting purposes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sometimes tests are conducted to determine whether the assumptions of anova appear to be violated . residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity and gross normality . residuals should have the appearance of ( zero mean normal distribution ) noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and uvmr_ev_paragraph_break modeled data values . trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a statistically significant effect in anova is often followed by additional tests . this can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses . follow - up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are " planned " ( a priori ) or " post hoc . " planned tests are determined before looking at the data , and post hoc tests are conceived only after looking at the data ( though the term " post hoc " is inconsistently used ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the follow - up tests may be " simple " pairwise comparisons of individual group means or may be " compound " comparisons ( for example , comparing the mean pooling across groups a , b and c to the mean of group d ) . comparisons can also look at tests of trend , such as linear and quadratic relationships , when the independent variable involves ordered levels . often the follow - up tests incorporate a method of adjusting for the multiple comparisons problem . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are several types of anova . many statisticians base anova on the design of the experiment , especially on the protocol that specifies the random assignment of treatments to subjects ; the protocols description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any blocking . it is also common to apply anova to observational data using an appropriate statistical model . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some popular designs use the following types of anova : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break balanced experiments ( those with an equal sample size for each treatment ) are relatively easy to interpret ; unbalanced experiments offer more complexity . for single - factor ( one - way ) anova , the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy , but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power . for more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications . " the orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case . this means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply . consequently , the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs . " in the general case , " the analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data , but then the sums of squares , mean squares , and f - ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation are considered . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anova is ( in part ) a test of statistical significance . the american psychological association ( and many other organisations ) holds the view that simply reporting statistical significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anova is considered to be a special case of linear regression which in turn is a special case of the general linear model . all consider the observations to be the sum of a model ( fit ) and a residual ( error ) to be minimized . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the kruskal–wallis test and the friedman test are nonparametric tests , which do not rely on an assumption of normality . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break below we make clear the connection between multi - way anova and linear regression . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break linearly re - order the data so that k - th observation is associated with a response yk and factors zk , b where b in 12 , ldots , b denotes the different factors and b is the total number of factors . in one - way anova b1 and in two - way anova b 2 . furthermore , we assume the b - th factor has ib levels , namely 12 , ldots , ib . now , we can one - hot encode the factors into the sumb1b ib dimensional vector vk . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the one - hot encoding function gb : 12 , ldots , ib mapsto 01ib is defined such that the i - th entry of gb ( zk , b ) is uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gb ( zk , b ) i begincases uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 1 textif izk , b uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break endcases uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the vector vk is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all b . thus , vk ' g2 ( zk , 2 ) , ' , ' ldots , ' , ' gb ( zk , b ) ' . in order to obtain a fully general b - way interaction anova we must also concatenate every additional interaction term in the vector vk and then add an intercept term . let that vector be xk . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with this notation in place , we now have the exact connection with linear regression . we simply regress response yk against the vector xk . however , there is a concern about identifiability . in order to overcome such issues we assume that the sum of the parameters within each set of interactions is equal to zero . from here , one can use f - statistics or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break we can consider the 2 - way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has 2 levels and the second factor has 3 levels . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break define ai 1 if zk , 1i and bi 1 if zk , 2 i , that is a is the one - hot encoding of the first factor and b is the one - hot encoding of the second factor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with that , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break xk ' a2 , ' , ' b1 , ' , ' b2 , ' , ' b3 ' , ' , a1 ' , ' times ' , ' b1 , ' , ' a1 ' , ' times ' , ' b2 , ' , ' a1 ' , ' times ' , ' b3 , ' , ' a2 ' , ' times ' , ' b1 , ' , ' a2 ' , ' times ' , ' b2 , ' , ' a2 ' , ' times ' , ' b3 , ' , ' 1 ' uvmr_ev_paragraph_break where the last term is an intercept term . for a more concrete example suppose that uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beginalign uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break endalign uvmr_ev_paragraph_break then , xk 01 , 10 , 00 , 00 , 10 , 01 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 45: Alkane ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in organic chemistry , an alkane , or paraffin ( a historical trivial name that also has other meanings ) , is an acyclic saturated hydrocarbon . in other words , an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree structure in which all the carbon–carbon bonds are single . alkanes have the general chemical formula . the alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane , where n1 ( sometimes called the parent molecule ) , to arbitrarily large and complex molecules , like pentacontane or 6 - ethyl - 2 - methyl - 5 - ( 1 - methylethyl ) octane , an isomer of tetradecane . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the international union of pure and applied chemistry ( iupac ) defines alkanes as " acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula , and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms " . however , some sources use the term to denote any saturated hydrocarbon , including those that are either monocyclic ( that is the cycloalkanes ) or polycyclic , despite their having a distinct general formula ( that is cycloalkanes are ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in an alkane , each carbon atom is sp3 - hybridized with 4 sigma bonds ( either c–c or c–h ) , and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms ( in a c–h bond ) . the longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its carbon skeleton or carbon backbone . the number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one group of the higher alkanes are waxes , solids at standard ambient temperature and pressure ( satp ) , for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with their repeated – units , the alkanes constitute a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ in molecular mass by multiples of 14u ( the total mass of each such methylene - bridge unit , which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 12u and two hydrogen atoms of mass 1u each ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break methane is produced by methanogenic bacteria and some long - chain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi . nevertheless , most alkanes do not have much biological activity . they can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active / reactive functional groups of biological molecules . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkanes have two main commercial sources : petroleum ( crude oil ) and natural gas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an alkyl group is an alkane - based molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding . they are generally abbreviated with the symbol for any organyl group , r , although alk is sometimes used to specifically symbolize an alkyl group ( as opposed to an alkenyl group or aryl group ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ordinarily the c - c single bond distance is 1 angstrom . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break saturated hydrocarbons can be linear , branched , or cyclic . the third group is sometimes called cycloalkanes . very complicated structures are possible by combining linear , branch , cyclic alkanes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various ways , forming structural isomers . the simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches . this isomer is sometimes called the n - isomer ( n for " normal " , although it is not necessarily the most common ) . however , the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points . the number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms for example , for acyclic alkanes : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break branched alkanes can be chiral . for example , 3 - methylhexane and its higher homologues are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number 3 . the above list only includes differences of connectivity , not stereochemistry . in addition to the alkane isomers , the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more rings . such compounds are called cycloalkanes , and are also excluded from the above list because changing the number of rings changes the molecular formula . for example , cyclobutane and methylcyclopropane are isomers of each other ( c4h8 ) , but are not isomers of butane ( c4h10 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the iupac nomenclature ( systematic way of naming compounds ) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains . unbranched , saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix " - ane " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1866 , august wilhelm von hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a , e , i , o and u to create suffixes - ane , - ene , - ine ( or - yne ) , - one , - une , for the hydrocarbons cnh2n2 , cnh2n , cnh2n−2 , cnh2n−4 , cnh2n−6 . in modern nomenclature , the first three specifically name hydrocarbons with single , double and triple bonds ; while " - one " now represents a ketone . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break straight - chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix " n - " or " n - " ( for " normal " ) where a non - linear isomer exists . although this is not strictly necessary and is not part of the iupac naming system , the usage is still common in cases where one wishes to emphasize or distinguish between the straight - chain and branched - chain isomers , for example , " n - butane " rather than simply " butane " to differentiate it from isobutane . alternative names for this group used in the petroleum industry are linear paraffins or n - paraffins . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first six members of the series ( in terms of number of carbon atoms ) are named as follows : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first four names were derived from methanol , ether , propionic acid and butyric acid . alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the suffix - ane to the appropriate numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel ( - a or - o ) from the basic numerical term . hence , pentane , c5h12 ; hexane , c6h14 ; heptane , c7h16 ; octane , c8h18 ; etcetera the numeral prefix is generally greek , however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine , for example nonane , use the latin prefix non - . for a more complete list , see list of straight - chain alkanes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes , for example n - pentane , isopentane , and neopentane . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break iupac naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break though technically distinct from the alkanes , this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the " cyclic alkanes . " as their description implies , they contain one or more rings . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break simple cycloalkanes have a prefix " cyclo - " to distinguish them from alkanes . cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones , for example , cyclopentane ( c5h10 ) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like pentane ( c5h12 ) , but they are joined up in a five - membered ring . in a similar manner , propane and cyclopropane , butane and cyclobutane , etcetera uvmr_ev_paragraph_break substituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes – the cycloalkane ring is stated , and the substituents are according to their position on the ring , with the numbering decided by the cahn–ingold–prelog priority rules . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the trivial ( non - systematic ) name for alkanes is ' paraffins ' . together , alkanes are known as the ' paraffin series ' . trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts . they were coined before the development of systematic names , and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry . cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break branched - chain alkanes are called isoparaffins . " paraffin " is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers , that is , compounds of the same chemical formula , for example , pentane and isopentane . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the following trivial names are retained in the iupac system : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some non - iupac trivial names are occasionally used : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all alkanes are colorless . alkanes with the lowest molecular weights are gasses , those of intermediate molecular weight are liquids , and the heaviest are waxy solids . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes experience intermolecular van der waals forces . stronger intermolecular van der waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are two determinants for the strength of the van der waals forces : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break under standard conditions , from ch4 to c4h10 alkanes are gaseous ; from c5h12 to c17h36 they are liquids ; and after c18h38 they are solids . as the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight , it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size ( molecular weight ) of the molecule . as a rule of thumb , the boiling point rises 20–30°c for each carbon added to the chain ; this rule applies to other homologous series . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a straight - chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched - chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact , thus the greater van der waals forces , between adjacent molecules . for example , compare isobutane ( 2 - methylpropane ) and n - butane ( butane ) , which boil at −12 and 0°c , and 22 - dimethylbutane and 23 - dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58°c , respectively . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on the other hand , cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules , which give a plane of intermolecular contact . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the melting points of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above . that is , ( all other things being equal ) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point . there is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points . solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids . this rigid structure requires energy to break down . thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart . for alkanes , this can be seen from the graph above ( that is , the blue line ) . the odd - numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes . this is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase , forming a well - organized structure , which requires more energy to break apart . the odd - numbered alkanes pack less well and so the " looser " organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart . for a visualization of the crystal structures see . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the melting points of branched - chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight - chain alkanes , again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way , nor are they substantially polarized by an electric field . for this reason , they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water . since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule , the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order ( a reduction in entropy ) . as there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules , the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water : alkanes are said to be hydrophobic as they are insoluble in water . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively high , a property that is called lipophilicity . alkanes are , for example , miscible in all proportions among themselves . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water . hence , alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane–water mixture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break molecular geometry uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics . it is derived from the electron configuration of carbon , which has four valence electrons . the carbon atoms in alkanes are described as sp3 hybrids , that is to say that , to a good approximation , the valence electrons are in orbitals directed towards the corners of a tetrahedron which are derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals . geometrically , the angle between the bonds are cos−1 ( − ) ≈109° . this is exact for the case of methane , while larger alkanes containing a combination of c–h and c–c bonds generally have bonds that are within several degrees of this idealized value . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an alkane has only c–h and c–c single bonds . the former result from the overlap of an sp3 orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen ; the latter by the overlap of two sp3 orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms the bond lengths amount to 1×10−10m for a c–h bond and 1×10−10m for a c–c bond . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp3 orbitals—they are tetrahedrally arranged , with an angle of 109° between them . structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another , while both common and useful , do not accurately depict the geometry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule . there is a further degree of freedom for each carbon–carbon bond : the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond . the spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes , as there is only one c–c bond . if one looks down the axis of the c–c bond , one will see the so - called newman projection . the hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120° between them , resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane . however , the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0° and 360° . this is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon–carbon single bond . despite this apparent freedom , only two limiting conformations are important : eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the two conformations differ in energy : the staggered conformation is 12kj / mol ( 3 kcal / mol ) lower in energy ( more stable ) than the eclipsed conformation ( the least stable ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this difference in energy between the two conformations , known as the torsion energy , is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature . there is constant rotation about the c–c bond . the time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next , equivalent to the rotation of one ch3 group by 120° relative to the other , is of the order of 10−11seconds . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the case of higher alkanes is more complex but based on similar principles , with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon–carbon bond . for this reason , alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models . the actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms , as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules : alkane molecules have no fixed structural form , whatever the models may suggest . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break virtually all organic compounds contain carbon–carbon , and carbon–hydrogen bonds , and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra . alkanes are notable for having no other groups , and therefore for the absence of other characteristic spectroscopic features of a functional group like –oh , –cho , –cooh etcetera uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the carbon–hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960cm−1 , while the carbon–carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300cm−1 . the carbon–hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group : methyl groups show bands at 1450cm−1 and 1375cm−1 , while methylene groups show bands at 1465cm−1 and 1450cm−1 . carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725cm−1 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at δh 0–1 . the carbon - 13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon : δc 8–30 ( primary , methyl , –ch3 ) , 15–55 ( secondary , methylene , –ch2– ) , 20–60 ( tertiary , methyne , c–h ) and quaternary . the carbon - 13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak , due to the lack of nuclear overhauser effect and the long relaxation time , and can be missed in weak samples , or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes have a high ionization energy , and the molecular ion is usually weak . the fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret , but , in the case of branched chain alkanes , the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals . the fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group ( m−15 ) is often absent , and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units , corresponding to sequential loss of ch2 groups . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes are only weakly reactive with most chemical compounds . the acid dissociation constant ( pka ) values of all alkanes are estimated to range from 50 to 70 , depending on the extrapolation method , hence they are extremely weak acids that are practically inert to bases ( see : carbon acids ) . they are also extremely weak bases , undergoing no observable protonation in pure sulfuric acid ( h0 −12 ) , although superacids that are at least millions of times stronger have been known to protonate them to give hypercoordinate alkanium ions ( see : methanium ion ) . similarly , they only show reactivity with the strongest of electrophilic reagents ( for example , dioxiranes and salts containing the nf4 cation ) . by virtue of their strongly c–h bonds ( 100 kcal / mol ) and c–c bonds ( 90 kcal / mol , but usually less sterically accessible ) , they are also relatively unreactive toward free radicals , although many electron - deficient radicals will react with alkanes in the absence of other electron - rich bonds ( see below ) . this inertness is the source of the term paraffins ( with the meaning here of " lacking affinity " ) . in crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break free radicals , molecules with unpaired electrons , play a large role in most reactions of alkanes , such as cracking and reformation where long - chain alkanes are converted into shorter - chain alkanes and straight - chain alkanes into branched - chain isomers . moreover , redox reactions of alkanes involving free radical intermediates , in particular with oxygen and the halogens , are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced state ; in the case of methane , carbon is in its lowest possible oxidation state ( −4 ) . reaction with oxygen ( if present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction stoichiometry ) leads to combustion without any smoke , producing carbon dioxide and water . free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens , leading to the production of haloalkanes . in addition , alkanes have been shown to interact with , and bind to , certain transition metal complexes in c–h bond activation reactions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in highly branched alkanes , the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value ( 109° ) to accommodate bulky groups . such distortions introduce a tension in the molecule , known as steric hindrance or strain . strain substantially increases reactivity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however , in general and perhaps surprisingly , when branching is not extensive enough to make highly disfavorable 12 - and 13 - alkyl–alkyl steric interactions ( worth 3 kcal / mol and 3 kcal / mol in the case of the eclipsing conformations of butane and pentane , respectively ) unavoidable , the branched alkanes are actually more thermodynamically stable than their linear ( or less branched ) isomers . for example , the highly branched 22 , 33 - tetramethylbutane is about 1 kcal / mol more stable than its linear isomer , n - octane . due to the subtlety of this effect , the exact reasons for this rule have been vigorously debated in the chemical literature and is yet unsettled . several explanations , including stabilization of branched alkanes by electron correlation , destabilization of linear alkanes by steric repulsion , stabilization by neutral hyperconjugation , have been advanced as possibilities . the controversy is related to the question of whether the traditional explanation of hyperconjugation is the primary factor governing the stability of alkyl radicals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction , although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases . the general equation for complete combustion is : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the absence of sufficient oxygen , carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed , as shown below : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for example , methane : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break see the alkane heat of formation table for detailed data . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the standard enthalpy change of combustion , δch⊖ , for alkanes increases by about 650kj / mol per ch2 group . branched - chain alkanes have lower values of δch⊖ than straight - chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms , and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes react with halogens in a so - called free radical halogenation reaction . the hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms free radicals are the reactive species that participate in the reaction , which usually leads to a mixture of products . the reaction is highly exothermic with halogen fluorine and can lead to an explosion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break these reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons . there are three steps : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers , indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction . the mixture produced , however , is not a statistical mixture : secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free - radicals . an example can be seen in the monobromination of propane : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones . this can be done with a thermal or catalytic method . the thermal cracking process follows a homolytic mechanism with formation of free radicals . the catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts ( usually solid acids such as silica - alumina and zeolites ) , which promote a heterolytic ( asymmetric ) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges , usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion . carbon - localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement , c–c scission in position beta ( that is , cracking ) and intra - and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer . in both types of processes , the corresponding reactive intermediates ( radicals , ions ) are permanently regenerated , and thus they proceed by a self - propagating chain mechanism . the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes . isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight - chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a platinum catalyst . in isomerization , the alkanes become branched - chain isomers . in other words , it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens , keeping the same molecular weight . in reformation , the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons , giving off hydrogen as a by - product . both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance . butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization , as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen . alkanes can be chlorosulfonated and nitrated , although both reactions require special conditions . the fermentation of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance . in the reed reaction , sulfur dioxide , chlorine and light convert hydrocarbons to sulfonyl chlorides . nucleophilic abstraction can be used to separate an alkane from a metal . alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by transmetalation reactions . a mixture of antimony pentafluoride ( sbf5 ) and fluorosulfonic acid ( hso3f ) , called magic acid , can protonate alkanes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes form a small portion of the atmospheres of the outer gas planets such as jupiter ( 0 methane , 2ppm ethane ) , saturn ( 0 methane , 5ppm ethane ) , uranus ( 1 methane , 2ppm ethane ) and neptune ( 1 methane , 1ppm ethane ) . titan ( 1 methane ) , a satellite of saturn , was examined by the huygens probe , which indicated that titans atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moons surface . also on titan the cassini mission has imaged seasonal methane / ethane lakes near the polar regions of titan . methane and ethane have also been detected in the tail of the comet hyakutake . chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal , which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space , away from the sun , which would have evaporated these volatile molecules . alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break traces of methane gas ( about 0 or 1745ppb ) occur in the earths atmosphere , produced primarily by methanogenic microorganisms , such as archaea in the gut of ruminants . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and oil . natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane , with some propane and butane : oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons . these hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants ( zooplankton and phytoplankton ) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an anoxic environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form . natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break these hydrocarbon deposits , collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks , comprise commercial oil fields . they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced . the depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break methane is also present in what is called biogas , produced by animals and decaying matter , which is a possible renewable energy source . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes have a low solubility in water , so the content in the oceans is negligible ; however , at high pressures and low temperatures ( such as at the bottom of the oceans ) , methane can co - crystallize with water to form a solid methane clathrate ( methane hydrate ) . although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time , the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together . methane extracted from methane clathrate is , therefore , a candidate for future fuels . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes : they prefer even - numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd - numbered chains . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on the other hand , certain archaea , the methanogens , produce large quantities of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidized organic compounds . the energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break methanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands . the methane output of cattle and other herbivores , which can release 30 to 50 gallons per day , and of termites , is also due to methanogens . they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans . methanogenic archaea are , hence , at the end of the carbon cycle , with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis . it is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes also play a role , if a minor role , in the biology of the three eukaryotic groups of organisms : fungi , plants and animals . some specialized yeasts , for example , candida tropicale , pichia sp . rhodotorula sp . can use alkanes as a source of carbon or energy . the fungus amorphotheca resinae prefers the longer - chain alkanes in aviation fuel , and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in plants , the solid long - chain alkanes are found in the plant cuticle and epicuticular wax of many species , but are only rarely major constituents . they protect the plant against water loss , prevent the leaching of important minerals by the rain , and protect against bacteria , fungi , and harmful insects . the carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually odd - numbered , between 27 and 33 carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by decarboxylation of even - numbered fatty acids . the exact composition of the layer of wax is not only species - dependent but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions , temperature or humidity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break more volatile short - chain alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues . the jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of n - heptane in its resin , for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating . floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components , and n - nonane is a significant component in the scent of some roses . emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane , pentane , and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels , though they are not generally considered to be a major component of biogenic air pollution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers , mainly 8 to 35 , usually peaking in the low to upper 20s , with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram ( parts per million by weight ) and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane fraction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes are found in animal products , although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons . one example is the shark liver oil , which is approximately 14 pristane ( 26 , 1014 - tetramethylpentadecane , c19h40 ) . they are important as pheromones , chemical messenger materials , on which insects depend for communication . in some species , for example the support beetle xylotrechus colonus , pentacosane ( c25h52 ) , 3 - methylpentaicosane ( c26h54 ) and 9 - methylpentaicosane ( c26h54 ) are transferred by body contact . with others like the tsetse fly glossina morsitans morsitans , the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2 - methylheptadecane ( c18h38 ) , 1721 - dimethylheptatriacontane ( c39h80 ) , 1519 - dimethylheptatriacontane ( c39h80 ) and 151923 - trimethylheptatriacontane ( c40h82 ) , and acts by smell over longer distances . waggle - dancing honey bees produce and release two alkanes , tricosane and pentacosane . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one example , in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role , is the ecological relationship between the sand bee ( andrena nigroaenea ) and the early spider orchid ( ophrys sphegodes ) ; the latter is dependent for pollination on the former . sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate ; in the case of nigroaenea , the females emit a mixture of tricosane ( c23h48 ) , pentacosane ( c25h52 ) and heptacosane ( c27h56 ) in the ratio 3 : 3 : 1 , and males are attracted by specifically this odor . the orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen ; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees . as a result , numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner : although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee , it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to other blooms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as stated earlier , the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and crude oil . alkanes are separated in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many products . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the fischer–tropsch process is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons , including alkanes , from carbon monoxide and hydrogen . this method is used to produce substitutes for petroleum distillates . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory , since they are usually commercially available . also , alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically , and do not undergo functional group interconversions cleanly . when alkanes are produced in the laboratory , it is often a side - product of a reaction . for example , the use of n - butyllithium as a strong base gives the conjugate acid , n - butane as a side - product : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however , at times it may be desirable to make a section of a molecule into an alkane - like functionality ( alkyl group ) using the above or similar methods . for example , an ethyl group is an alkyl group ; when this is attached to a hydroxy group , it gives ethanol , which is not an alkane . to do so , the best - known methods are hydrogenation of alkenes : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from alkyl halides in the corey–house–posner–whitesides reaction . the barton–mccombie deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols for example uvmr_ev_paragraph_break and the clemmensen reduction removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or alkyl - substituted compounds for example : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes can be prepared from a variety of organic compounds . these include alkenes , alkynes , haloalkanes , alcohols , aldehydes , ketones and carboxylic acids . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break addition of molecular hydrogen across the π bond ( s ) of alkenes and alkynes give alkanes . this hydrogenation reaction is typically performed using a powdered metal catalyst , such as palladium , platinum , or nickel . the reaction is exothermic because the product alkane is more stable . this is an important process in several fields of industrial and research chemistry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several methods produce alkanes from haloalkanes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the wurtz reaction , a haloalkane is treated with sodium in dry ether to yield an alkane having double the number of carbon atoms this reaction proceeds through a free radical intermediate and has the possibility of alkene formation in case of tertiary haloalkanes and vicinal dihalides . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in corey–house synthesis , a haloalkane is treated with dialkyl lithium cuprate , a gilman reagent , to yield a higher alkane : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break haloalkanes can be reduced to alkanes by reaction with hydride reagents such as lithium aluminium hydride . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the applications of alkanes depend on the number of carbon atoms the first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes , and in some countries for electricity generation . methane and ethane are the main components of natural gas ; they are normally stored as gases under pressure . it is , however , easier to transport them as liquids : this requires both compression and cooling of the gas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break propane and butane are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as liquified petroleum gas ( lpg ) . propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles , butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters . both are used as propellants in aerosol sprays . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from pentane to octane the alkanes are highly volatile liquids . they are used as fuels in internal combustion engines , as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets , which would impair the uniformity of the combustion . branched - chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition , which causes knocking , than their straight - chain homologues . this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of the fuel , where 22 , 4 - trimethylpentane ( isooctane ) has an arbitrary value of 100 , and heptane has a value of zero . apart from their use as fuels , the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes from nonane to , for instance , hexadecane ( an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms ) are liquids of higher viscosity , less and less suitable for use in gasoline . they form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel . diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number , cetane being an old name for hexadecane . however , the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions , where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil . in the latter function , they work at the same time as anti - corrosive agents , as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface . many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax , for example , in candles . this should not be confused however with true wax , which consists primarily of esters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen , used , for example , in road surfacing . however , the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene are alkanes with chains containing hundreds or thousands of carbon atoms these materials are used in innumerable applications , and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds . this inertness yields serious ecological issues if they are released into the environment . due to their lack of functional groups and low water solubility , alkanes show poor bioavailability for microorganisms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are , however , some microorganisms possessing the metabolic capacity to utilize n - alkanes as both carbon and energy sources . some bacterial species are highly specialised in degrading alkanes ; these are referred to as hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break methane is flammable , explosive and dangerous to inhale ; because it is a colorless , odorless gas , special caution must be taken around methane . ethane is also extremely flammable , explosive , and dangerous to inhale . both of them may cause suffocation . and may cause drowsiness or unconsciousness if inhaled . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkanes also pose a threat to the environment . branched alkanes have a lower biodegradability than unbranched alkanes . methane is considered to be the greenhouse gas that is most dangerous to the environment , although the amount of methane in the atmosphere is relatively low . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 46: Appellate procedure in the United States ***********

united states appellate procedure involves the rules and regulations for filing appeals in state courts and federal courts . the nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted . there are many types of standard of review for appeals , such as de novo and abuse of discretion . however , most appeals begin when a party files a petition for review to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower courts decision . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an appellate court is a court that hears cases on appeal from another court . depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance , a party to a court case who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds . these grounds typically could include errors of law , fact , procedure or due process . in different jurisdictions , appellate courts are also called appeals courts , courts of appeals , superior courts , or supreme courts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the specific procedures for appealing , including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision , can vary greatly from state to state . the right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state ; for example , the new jersey constitution vests judicial power in a supreme court , a superior court , and other courts of limited jurisdiction , with an appellate court being part of the superior court . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a party who files an appeal is called an " appellant " , " plaintiff in error " , " petitioner " or " pursuer " , and a party on the other side is called an " appellee " . a " cross - appeal " is an appeal brought by the respondent . for example , suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay 50000 . if the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money , then the plaintiff might file a cross - appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay 200000 instead of 50000 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the appellant is the party who , having lost part or all their claim in a lower court decision , is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered . this is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law , but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct , or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the appellant in the new case can be either the plaintiff ( or claimant ) , defendant , third - party intervenor , or respondent ( appellee ) from the lower case , depending on who was the losing party . the winning party from the lower court , however , is now the respondent . in unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below , but still appeal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court judgment was in its favor . the appellee is required to respond to the petition , oral arguments , and legal briefs of the appellant . in general , the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower courts decision should be affirmed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an appeal " as of right " is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle . the appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal . an appeal " by leave " or " permission " requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal ; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellants demand to appeal the lower courts decision . in the supreme court , review in most cases is available only if the court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in tort , equity , or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal . in criminal matters , however , the state or prosecution generally has no appeal " as of right " . and due to the double jeopardy principle , the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal . but in some jurisdictions , the state or prosecution may appeal " as of right " from a trial courts dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial courts granting of a defendants suppression motion . likewise , in some jurisdictions , the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law " by leave " from the trial court or the appellate court . the ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally . all parties must present grounds to appeal , or it will not be heard . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by convention in some law reports , the appellant is named first . this can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals , the name of the case in the law reports reverses ( in some cases twice ) as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy . this is not always true , however . in the federal courts , the parties ' names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the circuit courts of appeals , and are re - ordered only if the appeal reaches the supreme court . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals , particularly in the criminal context . the first is the traditional " direct " appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review . the second is the collateral appeal or post - conviction petition , in which the petitioner - appellant files the appeal in a court of first instance—usually the court that tried the case . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts , and the latter in federal courts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break relief in post - conviction is rare and is most often found in capital or violent felony cases . the typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating dna evidence demonstrating the defendants actual innocence . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " appellate review " is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate jurisdiction take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts . it is distinguished from judicial review , which refers to the courts overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons ( which may vary by jurisdiction ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final judgment . generally , an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case . this is because such orders cannot be appealed " as of right " . however , certain critical interlocutory court orders , such as the denial of a request for an interim injunction , or an order holding a person in contempt of court , can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are two distinct forms of appellate review , " direct " and " collateral " . for example , a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court , and lose on " direct appeal " to higher state appellate courts , and if unsuccessful , mount a " collateral " action such as filing for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts . generally speaking , " direct appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact . ' review ' , on the other hand , provides an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence , and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional , jurisdictional , or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial . " borgen " , 483 f 3d . 475 ( 7th cir . 2007 ) ( no . 04–4103 ) ( slip op . at 7 ) ( citation omitted ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in anglo - american common law courts , appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by prerogative writ in certain cases . there is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental civil law legal systems , though some mixed systems such as quebec recognize these prerogative writs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after exhausting the first appeal as of right , defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision . this appeal is known as a direct appeal . the highest state court , generally known as the supreme court , exercises discretion over whether it will review the case . on direct appeal , a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an appellants claim ( s ) must usually be preserved at trial . this means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial . because constitutional claims are of great magnitude , appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved . for example , connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims : 1 . he record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error ; 2 . the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right ; 3 . the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial ; 4 . if subject to harmless error analysis , the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all states have a post - conviction relief process . similar to federal post - conviction relief , an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review . typical claims might include ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence based on new evidence . these proceedings are normally separate from the direct appeal , however some states allow for collateral relief to be sought on direct appeal . after direct appeal , the conviction is considered final . an appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal . that is , it goes to the intermediate appellate court , followed by the highest court . if the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration , the sentence could be modified , or a new trial could be ordered . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a " notice of appeal " is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal . the form is completed by the appellant or by the appellants legal representative . the nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun . for example , the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court , or with the court from which the appeal is taken , or both . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the courts own web site . in new jersey , for example , the administrative office of the court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants , though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short : traditionally , it is measured in days , not months . this can vary from country to country , as well as within a country , depending on the specific rules in force . in the federal court system , criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed , or the right to appeal is forfeited . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not . the appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower courts findings of fact ( such as whether a defendant committed a particular act ) , unless clearly erroneous , and so will focus on the courts application of the law to those facts ( such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if the appellate court finds no defect , it " affirms " the judgment . if the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision " below " ( that is , in the lower court ) , it may " modify " the ruling to correct the defect , or it may nullify ( " reverse " or " vacate " ) the whole decision or any part of it . it may , in addition , send the case back ( " remand " or " remit " ) to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in some cases , an appellate court may review a lower court decision " de novo " ( or completely ) , challenging even the lower courts findings of fact . this might be the proper standard of review , for example , if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre - trial motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another situation is where appeal is by way of " re - hearing " . certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sometimes , the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits , which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below . ( this would happen , for example , if the appellant waited too long , under the appellate courts rules , to file the appeal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break generally , there is no trial in an appellate court , only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre - trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed—unless the appeal is by way of re - hearing , new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in " very " rare instances , for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as prosecutorial misconduct . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in some systems , an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court , together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal . in other systems , the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court . in those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee ( or respondent ) can present arguments against it . arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers , if represented , or " pro se " if the party has not engaged legal representation . those arguments are presented in written briefs and sometimes in oral argument to the court at a hearing . at such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in an adversarial system , appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it . therefore , if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner , or against legal precedent , that judgment will stand if not appealed – even if it might have been overturned on appeal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the united states legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals : a trial " de novo " or an appeal on the record . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial trial . if unchallenged , these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all . if a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal , one generally has the power to request a trial " de novo " by a court of record . in such a proceeding , all issues and evidence may be developed newly , as though never heard before , and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding . sometimes , however , the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence , thus helping to curb frivolous appeals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in some cases , an application for " trial de novo " effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place . the supreme court of virginia has stated that ' " this court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to " annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial . " ' the only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses , where they are convicted on a lesser offense , the appeal is of the lesser offense ; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses . " a trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles , . . . subject only to the limitation that conviction in the district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesser - included offense . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding , both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal . each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result . precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments . in order for the appeal to succeed , the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error , that is , an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust , and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly . some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case , permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney , admitting or excluding evidence improperly , acting outside the courts jurisdiction , injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so , juror misconduct , etcetera the failure to formally object at the time , to what one views as improper action in the lower court , may result in the affirmance of the lower courts judgment on the grounds that one did not " preserve the issue for appeal " by objecting . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact , an appellate court will apply an " abuse of discretion " standard of review . under this standard , the appellate court gives deference to the lower courts view of the evidence , and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion . this is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness . on the other hand , the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower courts decision on issues of law , and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in some cases , an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was unconstitutional or otherwise invalid , or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered . in the case of new evidence , there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial . another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel . if a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation , he is entitled to a new trial . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words " may it please the court . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after an appeal is heard , the " mandate " is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal ; this notice is transmitted to the trial court and , when filed by the clerk of the trial court , constitutes the final judgment on the case , unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court . the mandate is distinguished from the appeal courts opinion , which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision . in some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the " remittitur " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the result of an appeal can be : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there can be multiple outcomes , so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings , reverse others and remand the case all at the same time . remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case . " generally speaking , an appellate courts judgment provides ' the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed , setting out with specificity the courts determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed , reversed , remanded or modified ' " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than review improvidently granted . in other words , after looking at the case , they chose not to say anything . the result for the case of review improvidently granted is effectively the same as affirmed , but without that extra higher court stamp of approval . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 47: Answer (law) ***********

in law , an answer was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something , and thus generally any counter - statement or defense , a reply to a question or response , or objection , or a correct solution of a problem . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the common law , an answer is the first pleading by a defendant , usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information or indictment has been served upon the defendant . it may have been preceded by an optional " pre - answer " motion to dismiss or demurrer ; if such a motion is unsuccessful , the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a criminal case , there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court . the pleading in the criminal case , which is entered on the record in open court , is usually either guilty or not guilty . generally speaking in private , civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence . there is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of equitable remedy such as restitution or a permanent injunction . criminal cases may lead to fines or other punishment , such as imprisonment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the famous latin responsa prudentium ( " answers of the learned ones " ) were the accumulated views of many successive generations of roman lawyers , a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during debates of a contentious nature , deflection , colloquially known as ' changing the topic ' , has been widely observed , and is often seen as a failure to answer a question . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 48: Appellate court ***********

an appellate court , commonly called a court of appeal ( s ) , appeal court , court of second instance or second instance court , is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal . in much of the world , court systems are divided into at least three levels : the trial court , which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case ; at least one intermediate appellate court ; and a supreme court ( or court of last resort ) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts , often on a discretionary basis . a particular court systems supreme court is its highest appellate court . appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break under its standard of review , an appellate court decides the extent of the deference it would give to the lower courts decision , based on whether the appeal were one of fact or of law . in reviewing an issue of fact , an appellate court ordinarily gives deference to the trial courts findings . it is the duty of trial judges or juries to find facts , view the evidence firsthand , and observe witness testimony . when reviewing lower decisions on an issue of fact , courts of appeal generally look for clear error . the appellate court reviews issues of law de novo ( anew , no deference ) and may reverse or modify the lower courts decision if the appellate court believes the lower court misapplied the facts or the law . an appellate court may also review the lower judges discretionary decisions , such as whether the judge properly granted a new trial or disallowed evidence . the lower courts decision is only changed in cases of an " abuse of discretion " . this standard tends to be even more deferential than the " clear error " standard . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before hearing any case , the court must have jurisdiction to consider the appeal . the authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another . in some areas , the appellate court has limited powers of review . generally , an appellate courts judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed , setting out with specificity the courts determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed , reversed , remanded or modified . depending on the type of case and the decision below , appellate review primarily consists of : an entirely new hearing ( a non trial de novo ) ; a hearing where the appellate court gives deference to factual findings of the lower court ; or review of particular legal rulings made by the lower court ( an appeal on the record ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while many appellate courts have jurisdiction over all cases decided by lower courts , some systems have appellate courts divided by the type of jurisdiction they exercise . some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts , such as the texas court of criminal appeals , which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases , and the court of appeals for the federal circuit , which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases , on one hand , and appeals from the court of federal claims on the other . in the united states , alabama , tennessee , and oklahoma also have separate courts of criminal appeals . texas and oklahoma have the final determination of criminal cases vested in their respective courts of criminal appeals , while alabama and tennessee allow decisions of its court of criminal appeals to be finally appealed to the state supreme court . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the court of appeal of new zealand , located in wellington , is new zealands principal intermediate appellate court . in practice , most appeals are resolved at this intermediate appellate level , rather than in the supreme court . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the court of appeals of the philippines is the principal intermediate appellate court of that country . the court of appeals is primarily found in manila , with three divisions each in cebu city and cagayan de oro . other appellate courts include the sandiganbayan for cases involving graft and corruption , and the court of tax appeals for cases involving tax . appeals from all three appellate courts are to the supreme court . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the court of appeal of sri lanka , located in colombo , is the second senior court in the sri lankan legal system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the united states , both state and federal appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations , rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were . furthermore , appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court . hence , such an appellate court will not consider an appellants argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the appeal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in most states , and in federal courts , parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right . this means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome . however , appeals may be costly , and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict . therefore , only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals . some appellate courts , particularly supreme courts , have the power of discretionary review , meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many jurisdictions title their appellate court a court of appeal or court of appeals . historically , others have titled their appellate court a court of errors ( or court of errors and appeals ) , on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts . examples of such courts include the new jersey court of errors and appeals ( which existed from 1844 to 1947 ) , the connecticut supreme court of errors ( which has been renamed the connecticut supreme court ) , the kentucky court of errors ( renamed the kentucky supreme court ) , and the mississippi high court of errors and appeals ( since renamed the supreme court of mississippi ) . in some jurisdictions , a court able to hear appeals is known as an appellate division . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the phrase " court of appeals " most often refers to intermediate appellate courts . however , the maryland and new york systems are different . the maryland court of appeals and the new york court of appeals are the highest appellate courts in those states . the new york supreme court is a trial court of general jurisdiction . depending on the system , certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts , hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

" uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in federal courts , arraignment takes place in two stages . the first is called the " initial arraignment " and must take place within 48 hours of an individuals arrest , 72 hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until monday . during this stage , the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel . the presiding judge also decides at what amount , if any , to set bail . during the second stage , a post - indictment arraignment ( pia ) , the defendant is allowed to enter a plea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in new york , most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within 24 hours . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in california , arraignments must be conducted without unnecessary delay and , in any event , within 48 hours of arrest , excluding weekends and holidays . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction . however , it generally conforms with the following principles : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break video arraignment is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of videoconferencing technology . use of video arraignment system allows the court to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the courtroom by using an audio - visual link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants . the transportation of defendants requires time , puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public , court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention . it also addresses the rising costs of transportation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if the defendant pleads guilty , an evidentiary hearing usually follows . the court is not required to accept a guilty plea . during the hearing , the judge assesses the offense , the mitigating factors , and the defendants character , and passes sentence . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if the defendant pleads not guilty , a date is set for a preliminary hearing or a trial . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the past , a defendant who refused to plead ( or " stood mute " ) was subject to peine forte et dure ( law french for " strong and hard punishment " ) . today , in common law jurisdictions , the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea . the rationale for this is the defendants right to silence . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this is also often the stage at which arguments for or against pre - trial release and bail may be made , depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 50: America the Beautiful ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " america the beautiful " is a patriotic american song . its lyrics were written by katharine lee bates and its music was composed by church organist and choirmaster samuel ward at grace episcopal church in newark , new jersey . the two never met . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bates wrote the words as a poem originally entitled " pikes peak " . it was first published in the fourth of july 1895 edition of the church periodical , the congregationalist . it was at that time that the poem was first entitled " america " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ward had initially composed the songs melody in 1882 to accompany lyrics to " materna " , basis of the hymn , " o mother dear , jerusalem " , though the hymn was not first published until 1892 . the combination of wards melody and batess poem was first entitled " america the beautiful " in 1910 . the song is one of the most popular of the many patriotic songs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1893 , at the age of 33 , bates , an english professor at wellesley college , had taken a train trip to colorado springs , colorado , to teach at colorado college . several of the sights on her trip inspired her , and they found their way into her poem , including the worlds columbian exposition in chicago , the " white city " with its promise of the future contained within its gleaming white buildings ; the wheat fields of americas heartland kansas , through which her train was riding on july 16 ; and the majestic view of the great plains from high atop pikes peak . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on the pinnacle of that mountain , the words of the poem started to come to her , and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original antlers hotel . the poem was initially published two years later in the congregationalist to commemorate the fourth of july . it quickly caught the publics fancy . an amended version was published in 1904 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first known melody written for the song was sent in by silas pratt when the poem was published in the congregationalist . by 1900 , at least 75 different melodies had been written . a hymn tune composed in 1882 by samuel ward , the organist and choir director at grace church , newark , was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today . just as bates had been inspired to write her poem , ward , too , was inspired . the tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from coney island back to his home in new york city after a leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down . he composed the tune for the old hymn " o mother dear , jerusalem " , retitling the work " materna " . wards music combined with batess poem were first published together in 1910 and titled " america the beautiful " . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ward died in 1903 , not knowing the national stature his music would attain . bates was more fortunate , since the songs popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at various times in the more than one hundred years that have elapsed since the song was written , particularly during the john kennedy administration , there have been efforts to give " america the beautiful " legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to , or in place of , " the star - spangled banner " , but so far this has not succeeded . proponents prefer " america the beautiful " for various reasons , saying it is easier to sing , more melodic , and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as " the star - spangled banner " . some prefer " america the beautiful " over " the star - spangled banner " due to the latters war - oriented imagery ; others prefer " the star - spangled banner " for the same reason . while that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem , " america the beautiful " continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of americans , and was even being considered before 1931 as a candidate to become the national anthem of the united states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break o great for halcyon skies , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for amber waves of grain , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for purple mountain majesties uvmr_ev_paragraph_break above the enameled plain ! uvmr_ev_paragraph_break america ! america ! uvmr_ev_paragraph_break god shed his grace on thee , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break till souls wax fair as earth and air uvmr_ev_paragraph_break and music -

disabled person . in other words , assistive technology is any object or system that helps people with disabilities , while adaptive technology is specifically designed for disabled people . consequently , adaptive technology is a subset of assistive technology . adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break occupational therapy ( ot ) is a healthcare profession that specializes in maintaining or improving the quality of life for individuals that experience challenges when independently performing lifes occupations . according to the occupational therapy practice framework : domain and process ( 3rd ed . aota , 2014 ) , occupations include areas related to all basic and instrumental activities of daily living ( adls ) , rest and sleep , education , work , play , leisure and social participation . occupational therapists have the specialized skill of employing assistive technology ( at ) in the improvement and maintenance of optimal , functional participation in occupations . the application of at enables an individual to adapt aspects of the environment , that may otherwise be challenging , to the user in order to optimize functional participation in those occupations . as a result , occupational therapists may educate , recommend , and promote the use of at to improve the quality of life for their clients . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break wheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled , and that include a seating system and are designed to be a substitute for the normal mobility that most people have . wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility - related activities of daily living which include feeding , toileting , dressing , grooming , and bathing . the devices come in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick , sip - and - puff control , head switches or other input devices . often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers . wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness , injury , or disability . people with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break newer advancements in wheelchair design enable wheelchairs to climb stairs , go off - road or propel using segway technology or additional add - ons like handbikes or power assists . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break patient transfer devices generally allow patients with impaired mobility to be moved by caregivers between beds , wheelchairs , commodes , toilets , chairs , stretchers , shower benches , automobiles , swimming pools , and other patient support systems ( that is , radiology , surgical , or examining tables ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the most common devices are transfer benches , stretcher or convertible chairs ( for lateral , supine transfer ) , sit - to - stand lifts ( for moving patients from one seated position to another that is , from wheelchairs to commodes ) , air bearing inflatable mattresses ( for supine transfer that is , transfer from a gurney to an operating room table ) , gait belts ( or transfer belt ) and a slider board ( or transfer board ) , usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair or from a bed to an operating table . highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a patient lift ( a floor or ceiling - suspended sling lift ) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state - of - the - art transfer device by osha and the american nursing association . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a walker or walking frame or rollator is a tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking . it consists of a frame that is about waist high , approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user . walkers are also available in other sizes , such as for children , or for heavy people . modern walkers are height - adjustable . the front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it . it is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a prosthesis , prosthetic , or prosthetic limb is a device that replaces a missing body part . it is part of the field of biomechatronics , the science of using mechanical devices with human muscular , musculoskeletal , and nervous systems to assist or enhance motor control lost by trauma , disease , or defect . prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury ( traumatic ) or missing from birth ( congenital ) or to supplement defective body parts . inside the body , artificial heart valves are in common use with artificial hearts and lungs seeing less common use but under active technology development . other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include hearing aids , artificial eyes , palatal obturator , gastric bands , and dentures . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break prostheses are specifically not orthoses , although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis . prostheses are technically the complete finished item . for instance , a c - leg knee alone is not a prosthesis , but only a prosthetic component . the complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system to the residual limb — usually a " socket " , and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device . despite the technical difference , the terms are often used interchangeably . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the terms " prosthetic " and " orthotic " are adjectives used to describe devices such as a prosthetic knee . the terms " prosthetics " and " orthotics " are used to describe the respective allied health fields . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an occupational therapists role in prosthetics include therapy , training and evaluations . prosthetic training includes orientation to prosthetics components and terminology , donning and doffing , wearing schedule , and how to care for residual limb and the prosthesis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a powered exoskeleton is a wearable mobile machine that is powered by a system of electric motors , pneumatics , levers , hydraulics , or a combination of technologies that allow for limb movement with increased strength and endurance . its design aims to provide back support , sense the users motion , and send a signal to motors which manage the gears . the exoskeleton supports the shoulder , waist and thigh , and assists movement for lifting and holding heavy items , while lowering back stress . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break people with balance and motor function challenges often need specialized equipment to sit or stand safely and securely . this equipment is frequently specialized for specific settings such as in a classroom or nursing home . positioning is often important in seating arrangements to ensure that users body pressure is distributed equally without inhibiting movement in a desired way . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break positioning devices have been developed to aid in allowing people to stand and bear weight on their legs without risk of a fall . these standers are generally grouped into two categories based on the position of the occupant . prone standers distribute the body weight to the front of the individual and usually have a tray in front of them . this makes them good for users who are actively trying to carry out some task . supine standers distribute the body weight to the back and are good for cases where the user has more limited mobility or is recovering from injury . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many people with serious visual impairments live independently , using a wide range of tools and techniques . examples of assistive technology for visually impairment include screen readers , screen magnifiers , braille embossers , desktop video magnifiers , and voice recorders . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break screen readers are used to help the visually impaired to easily access electronic information . these software programs run on a computer in order to convey the displayed information through voice ( text - to - speech ) or braille ( refreshable braille displays ) in combination with magnification for low vision users in some cases . there are a variety of platforms and applications available for a variety of costs with differing feature sets . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some example of screen readers are apple voiceover , google talkback and microsoft narrator . this software is provided free of charge on all apple devices . apple voiceover includes the option to magnify the screen , control the keyboard , and provide verbal descriptions to describe what is happening on the screen . there are thirty languages to select from . it also has the capacity to read aloud file content , as well as web pages , e - mail messages , and word processing files . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as mentioned above , screen readers may rely on the assistance of text - to - speech tools . to use the text - to - speech tools , the documents must in an electronic form , that is uploaded as the digital format . however , people usually will use the hard copy documents scanned into the computer , which cannot be recognized by the text - to - speech software . to solve this issue , people always use optical character recognition technology accompanied with text - to - speech software . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break braille is a system of raised dots formed into units called braille cells . a full braille cell is made up of six dots , with two parallel rows of three dots , but other combinations and quantities of dots represent other letters , numbers , punctuation marks , or words . people can then use their fingers to read the code of raised dots . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a braille embosser is , simply put , a printer for braille . instead of a standard printer adding ink onto a page , the braille embosser imprints the raised dots of braille onto a page . some braille embossers combine both braille and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a refreshable braille display or braille terminal is an electro - mechanical device for displaying braille characters , usually by means of round - tipped pins raised through holes in a flat surface . computer users who cannot use a computer monitor use it to read a braille output version of the displayed text . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break desktop video magnifiers are electronic devices that use a camera and a display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials . they enlarge printed pages for those with low vision . a camera connects to a monitor that displays real - time images , and the user can control settings such as magnification , focus , contrast , underlining , highlighting , and other screen preferences . they come in a variety of sizes and styles ; some are small and portable with handheld cameras , while others are much larger and mounted on a fixed stand . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a screen magnifier is software that interfaces with a computers graphical output to present enlarged screen content . it allows users to enlarge the texts and graphics on their computer screens for easier viewing . similar to desktop video magnifiers , this technology assists people with low vision . after the user loads the software into their computers memory , it serves as a kind of " computer magnifying glass . " wherever the computer cursor moves , it enlarges the area around it . this allows greater computer accessibility for a wide range of visual abilities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a large - print keyboard has large letters printed on the keys . on the keyboard shown , the round buttons at the top control software which can magnify the screen ( zoom in ) , change the background color of the screen , or make the mouse cursor on the screen larger . the " bump dots " on the keys , installed in this case by the organization using the keyboards , help the user find the right keys in a tactile way . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break assistive technology for navigation has exploded on the ieee xplore database since 2000 , with over 7500 engineering articles written on assistive technologies and visual impairment in the past 25 years , and over 1300 articles on solving the problem of navigation for people who are blind or visually impaired . as well , over 600 articles on augmented reality and visual impairment have appeared in the engineering literature since 2000 . most of these articles were published within the past 5 years , and the number of articles in this area is increasing every year . gps , accelerometers , gyroscopes , and cameras can pinpoint the exact location of the user and provide information on what is in the immediate vicinity , and assistance in getting to a destination . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break wearable technology are smart electronic devices that can be worn on the body as an implant or an accessory . new technologies are exploring how the visually impaired can receive visual information through wearable devices . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some wearable devices for visual impairment include : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break personal emergency response systems ( pers ) , or telecare ( uk term ) , are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer . an example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors , thermometers ( for hypothermia risk ) , flooding and unlit gas sensors ( for people with mild dementia ) . notably , these alerts can be customized to the particular persons risks . when the alert is triggered , a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in human–computer interaction , computer accessibility ( also known as accessible computing ) refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people , regardless of disability or severity of impairment , examples include web accessibility guidelines . another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal , such as a smart card , that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed , text size , etcetera to their particular needs . this is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in libraries , atm , information kiosks etcetera the concept is encompassed by the cen en 1332 - 4 identification card systems – man - machine interface . this development of this standard has been supported in europe by snapi and has been successfully incorporated into the lasseo specifications , but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break people in the d / deaf and hard of hearing community have a more difficult time receiving auditory information as compared to hearing individuals . these individuals often rely on visual and tactile mediums for receiving and communicating information . the use of assistive technology and devices provides this community with various solutions to auditory communication needs by providing higher sound ( for those who are hard of hearing ) , tactile feedback , visual cues and improved technology access . individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing utilize a variety of assistive technologies that provide them with different access to information in numerous environments . most devices either provide amplified sound or alternate ways to access information through vision and / or vibration . these technologies can be grouped into three general categories : hearing technology , alerting devices , and communication support . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a hearing aid or deaf aid is an electro - acoustic device which is designed to amplify sound for the wearer , usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible , and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry . this type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their hearing communities by allowing them to hear more clearly . they amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone , amplifier , and speaker . there is a wide variety of hearing aids available , including digital , in - the - ear , in - the - canal , behind - the - ear , and on - the - body aids . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break assistive listening devices include fm , infrared , and loop assistive listening devices . this type of technology allows people with hearing difficulties to focus on a speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background noises and distractions , making places like auditoriums , classrooms , and meetings much easier to participate in . the assistive listening device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it wirelessly over an fm ( frequency modulation ) transmission , ir ( infra red ) transmission , il ( induction loop ) transmission , or other transmission methods . the person who is listening may use an fm / ir / il receiver to tune into the signal and listen at his / her preferred volume . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this type of assistive technology allows users to amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls so that they can easily partake in this medium of communication . there are also options to adjust the frequency and tone of a call to suit their individual hearing needs . additionally , there is a wide variety of amplified telephones to choose from , with different degrees of amplification . for example , a phone with 26 to 40 decibel is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss , while a phone with 71 to 90 decibel is better for more severe hearing loss . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break augmentative and alternative communication ( aac ) is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language . aac systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user . they may be as basic as pictures on a board that are used to request food , drink , or other care ; or they can be advanced speech generating devices , based on speech synthesis , that are capable of storing hundreds of phrases and words . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break assistive technology for cognition ( atc ) is the use of technology ( usually high tech ) to augment and assist cognitive processes such as attention , memory , self - regulation , navigation , emotion recognition and management , planning , and sequencing activity . systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of atc are growing rapidly , but have focused on memory and planning , that there is emerging evidence for efficacy , that a lot of scope exists to develop new atc . examples of atc include : neuropage which prompts users about meetings , wakamaru , which provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and calls for help if something is wrong , and telephone reassurance systems uvmr_ev_paragraph_break memory aids are any type of assistive technology that helps a user learn and remember certain information . many memory aids are used for cognitive impairments such as reading , writing , or organizational difficulties . for example , a smartpen records handwritten notes by creating both a digital copy and an audio recording of the text . users simply tap certain parts of their notes , the pen saves it , and reads it back to them . from there , the user can also download their notes onto a computer for increased accessibility . digital voice recorders are also used to record " in the moment " information for fast and easy recall at a later time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a 2017 cochrane review highlighted the current lack of high - quality evidence to determine whether assistive technology effectively supports people with dementia to manage memory issues . thus , it is not presently sure whether or not assistive technology is beneficial for memory problems uvmr_ev_paragraph_break educational software is software that assists people with reading , learning , comprehension , and organizational difficulties . any accommodation software such as text readers , notetakers , text enlargers , organization tools , word predictions , and talking word processors falls under the category of educational software . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break adaptive eating devices include items commonly used by the general population like spoons and forks and plates . however they become assistive technology when they are modified to accommodate the needs of people who have difficulty using standard cutlery due to a disabling condition . common modifications include increasing the size of the utensil handle to make it easier to grasp . plates and bowls may have a guard on the edge that stops food being pushed off of the dish when it is being scooped . more sophisticated equipment for eating includes manual and powered feeding devices . these devices support those who have little or no hand and arm function and enable them to eat independently . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break assistive technology in sports is an area of technology design that is growing . assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play . assistive technology may be used in adaptive sports , where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate ; or , assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports , leading to the development of new assistive technology . assistive technology devices can be simple , or " low - technology " , or they may use highly advanced technology . " low - tech " devices can include velcro gloves and adaptive bands and tubes . " high - tech " devices can include all - terrain wheelchairs and adaptive bicycles . accordingly , assistive technology can be found in sports ranging from local community recreation to the elite paralympic games . more complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time , and as a result , sports for people with disabilities " have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition - oriented activity " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the united states there are two major pieces of legislation that govern the use of assistive technology within the school system . the first is section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973 and the second being the individuals with disabilities education act ( idea ) which was first enacted in 1975 under the name the education for all handicapped children act . in 2004 , during the reauthorization period for idea , the national instructional material access center ( nimac ) was created which provided a repository of accessible text including publishers textbooks to students with a qualifying disability . files provided are in xml format and used as a starting platform for braille readers , screen readers , and other digital text software . idea defines assistive technology as follows : " any item , piece of equipment , or product system , whether acquired commercially off the shelf , modified , or customized , that is used to increase , maintain , or improve functional capabilities of a child with a disability . ( b ) exception . - the term does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted , or the replacement of such device . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break assistive technology listed is a students iep is not only recommended , it is required ( koch , 2017 ) . these devices help students both with and without disabilities access the curriculum in a way they were previously unable to ( koch , 2017 ) . occupational therapists play an important role in educating students , parents and teachers about the assistive technology they may interact with ( koch , 2017 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break assistive technology in this area is broken down into low , mid , and high tech categories . low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging . examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading . mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing . high tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software . software supports for writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding , word prediction for spelling , and speech to text . supports for reading include the use of text to speech ( tts ) software and font modification via access to digital text . limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using mathml and daisy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one of the largest problems that affect disabled people is discomfort with prostheses . an experiment performed in massachusetts utilized 20 people with various sensors attached to their arms the subjects tried different arm exercises , and the sensors recorded their movements . all of the data helped engineers develop new engineering concepts for prosthetics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break assistive technology may attempt to improve the ergonomics of the devices themselves such as dvorak and other alternative keyboard layouts , which offer more ergonomic layouts of the keys . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break assistive technology devices have been created to enable disabled people to use modern touch screen mobile computers such as the ipad , iphone and ipod touch . the pererro is a plug and play adapter for ios devices which uses the built in apple voiceover feature in combination with a basic switch . this brings touch screen technology to those who were previously unable to use it . apple , with the release of ios 7 had introduced the ability to navigate apps using switch control . switch access could be activated either through an external bluetooth connected switch , single touch of the screen , or use of right and left head turns using the devices camera . additional accessibility features include the use of assistive touch which allows a user to access multi - touch gestures through pre - programmed onscreen buttons . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for users with physical disabilities a large variety of switches are available and customizable to the users needs varying in size , shape , or amount of pressure required for activation . switch access may be placed near any area of the body which has consistent and reliable mobility and less subject to fatigue . common sites include the hands , head , and feet . eye gaze and head mouse systems can also be used as an alternative mouse navigation . a user may utilize single or multiple switch sites and the process often involves a scanning through items on a screen and activating the switch once the desired object is highlighted . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the form of home automation called assistive domotics focuses on making it possible for elderly and disabled people to live independently . home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility . this field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home automation for security , entertainment , and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users . for example , automated prompts and reminders utilize motion sensors and pre - recorded audio messages ; an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off the oven , and one by the front door may remind the resident to lock the door . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break innovation is happening in assistive technology either through improvements to existing devices or the creation of new products . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the wipo published 2019 report on technology trends , assistive products are grouped into either conventional or emerging technologies . conventional assisting technology tracks innovation within well - established assistive products , whereas emerging assistive technology refers to more advanced products . these identified advanced assistive products are distinguished from the conventional ones by the use of one or more enabling technologies ( for instance , artificial intelligence , internet of things , advanced sensors , new material , additive manufacturing , advanced robotics , augmented and virtual reality ) or by the inclusion of implantable products / components . such emerging assistive products are either more sophisticated or more functional versions of conventional assistive products , or completely novel assistive devices . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for instance , in conventional self - care assistive technology , technologies involved typically include adaptive clothing , adaptive eating devices , incontinence products , assistive products for manicure , pedicure , hair and facial care , dental care , or assistive products for sexual activities . in comparison , emerging self - care assistive technologies include health and emotion monitoring , smart diapers , smart medication dispensing and management or feeding assistant robot . although the distinction between conventional and emerging technologies is not always clear - cut , emerging assistive technology tends to be “smarter” , using ai and being more connected and interactive , and including body - integrated solutions or components . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to a great extent this « conventional » versus « emerging » classification is based on the whos priority assistive products list and the iso 9999 standard for assistive products for persons with disabilities , the apl delineating the absolute minimum that countries should be offering to their citizens and iso 9999 defining those products which are already well established in the market . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this " well - established status " is reflected in the patent filings between 2013 and 2017 . patent registrations for assistive technologies identified as conventional are nearly eight times larger than the ones for emerging assistive technologies . however , patent filings related to more recent emerging assistive technologies are growing almost three times as fast as those pertaining to conventional ones . patent filings in both conventional and emerging assistive technology are highly concentrated on mobility , hearing and vision . investment in emerging assistive technology also focuses on environment . in the conventional sector , mobility represent 54 of all patents fillings , and is an indication of increased interest in advanced mobility assistive product categories , such as advanced prosthetics , walking aids , wheelchairs , and exoskeletons . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the past , the top patent offices for filing , and therefore perceived target markets , in assistive technology have been the and japan . patenting activity has , however , been declining in these two jurisdictions . at the same time , there has been a surge in patent filings in china and an increase in filings in the republic of korea . this pattern is observed for both conventional and emerging assistive technology , with chinas annual filings surpassing those of the in 2008 for conventional and 2014 for emerging assistive technology . patent filings related to conventional assistive technology have also declined in europe , especially in germany , france , the netherlands and norway . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break patenting activity indicates the amount of interest and the investment made in respect to an invention’s applicability and its commercialization potential . there is typically a lag between filing a patent application and commercialization , with a product being classified in various stages of readiness levels , research concept , proof of concept , minumum viable product and finally commercial product . according to the 2019 wipo report , the emerging technologies closest to a fully commercial product were for example : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the technology readiness level and the related patenting activity can also be explained through the following factors which contribute to a product’s entry to market , such as the expected impact on a person’s participation in different aspects of life , the ease of adoption ( need for training , fitting , additional equipment for interoperability , and so on ) , the societal acceptance and potential ethical concerns , and the need for regulatory approval . this is mainly the case for assistive technology that qualifies as medical technology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break among these aspects , acceptability and ethical considerations are particularly relevant to those technologies that are extremely invasive ( such as cortical or auditory brainstem implants ) , or replace the human caregiver and human interaction , or collect and use data on cloud - based services or interconnected devices ( for example , companion robots , smart nursing and health - monitoring technologies ) , raising privacy issues and requiring connectivity , or raise safety concerns , such as autonomous wheelchairs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beyond the patent landscape , industrial designs have an added importance for the field of assistive technology . assistive technology is often not adopted , or else abandoned entirely , because of issues to do with design ( lack of appeal ) or comfort ( poor ergonomics ) . design often plays a role after the patenting activity , as a product needs to be re - designed for mass production . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break overall , assistive technology aims to allow disabled people to " participate more fully in all aspects of life ( home , school , and community ) " and increases their opportunities for " education , social interactions , and potential for meaningful employment " . it creates greater independence and control for disabled individuals . for example , in one study of 1342 infants , toddlers and preschoolers , all with some kind of developmental , physical , sensory , or cognitive disability , the use of assistive technology created improvements in child development . these included improvements in " cognitive , social , communication , literacy , motor , adaptive , and increases in engagement in learning activities " . additionally , it has been found to lighten caregiver load . both family and professional caregivers benefit from assistive technology . through its use , the time that a family member or friend would need to care for a patient significantly decreases . however , studies show that care time for a professional caregiver increases when assistive technology is used . nonetheless , their work load is significantly easier as the assistive technology frees them of having to perform certain tasks . there are several platforms that use machine learning to identify the appropriate assistive device to suggest to patients , making assistive devices more accessible . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 52: Abacus ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the abacus ( plural abaci or abacuses ) , also called a counting frame , is a calculating tool which has been used since ancient times . it was used in the ancient near east , europe , china , and russia , centuries before the adoption of the hindu - arabic numeral system . the exact origin of the abacus has not yet emerged . it consists of rows of movable beads , or similar objects , strung on a wire . they represent digits . one of the two numbers is set up , and the beads are manipulated to perform an operation such as addition , or even a square or cubic root . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in their earliest designs , the rows of beads could be loose on a flat surface or sliding in grooves . later the beads were made to slide on rods and built into a frame , allowing faster manipulation . abacuses are still made , often as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires . in the ancient world , particularly before the introduction of positional notation , abacuses were a practical calculating tool . the abacus is still used to teach the fundamentals of mathematics to some children , for example , in russia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break designs such as the japanese soroban have been used for practical calculations of up to multi - digit numbers . any particular abacus design supports multiple methods to perform calculations , including the four basic operations and square and cube roots . some of these methods work with non - natural numbers ( numbers such as and ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although calculators and computers are commonly used today instead of abacuses , abacuses remain in everyday use in some countries . merchants , traders , and clerks in some parts of eastern europe , russia , china , and africa use abacuses . the abacus remains in common use uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a scoring system in non - electronic table games . others may use an abacus due to visual impairment that prevents the use of a calculator . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word abacus dates to at least ad 1387 when a middle english work borrowed the word from latin that described a sandboard abacus . the latin word is derived from ancient greek ἄβαξ ( abax ) which means something without a base , and colloquially , any piece of rectangular material . alternatively , without reference to ancient texts on etymology , it has been suggested that it means " a square tablet strewn with dust " , or " drawing - board covered with dust ( for the use of mathematics ) " ( the exact shape of the latin perhaps reflects the genitive form of the greek word , ἄβακoς ( abakos ) . while the table strewn with dust definition is popular , some argue evidence is insufficient for that conclusion . efngroupnbboth gadd , a keeper of the egyptian and assyrian antiquities at the british museum , and jacob levy , a jewish historian who wrote neuhebräisches und chaldäisches wörterbuch über die talmudim und midraschim ' and ' , ' chaldean ' , ' dictionary ' , ' on ' , ' the ' , ' talmuds ' , ' and ' , ' midrashi ' disagree with the " dust table " theory . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break both abacuses and abaci uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the sumerian abacus appeared between 2700–2300 bc . it held a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal ( base 60 ) number system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some scholars point to a character in babylonian cuneiform that may have been derived from a representation of the abacus . it is the belief of old babylonian scholars , such as ettore carruccio , that old babylonians " may have used the abacus for the operations of addition and subtraction ; however , this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break greek historian herodotus mentioned the abacus in ancient egypt . he wrote that the egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left , opposite in direction to the greek left - to - right method . archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters . however , wall depictions of this instrument are yet to be discovered . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at around 600 bc , persians first began to use the abacus , during the achaemenid empire . under the parthian , sassanian , and iranian empires , scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them – india , china , and the roman empire - which is how the abacus may have been exported to other countries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the greek abacus dates to the 5th century bc . demosthenes ( 384 bc–322 bc ) complained that the need to use pebbles for calculations was too difficult . a play by alexis from the 4th century bc mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting , and both diogenes and polybius use the abacus as a metaphor for human behavior , stating " that men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less " like the pebbles on an abacus . the greek abacus was a table of wood or marble , pre - set with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations . this greek abacus was used in achaemenid persia , the etruscan civilization , ancient rome , and the western christian world until the french revolution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a tablet found on the greek island salamis in 1846 ad ( the salamis tablet ) dates to 300 bc , making it the oldest counting board discovered so far . it is a slab of white marble 149 cm in length , 75 cm wide , and 4 cm thick , on which are 5 groups of markings . in the tablets center is a set of 5 parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line , capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the bottom - most horizontal line and the single vertical line . below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it . below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines , again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them , but with the semicircle at the top of the intersection ; the third , sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line . also from this time frame , the darius vase was unearthed in 1851 . it was covered with pictures , including a " treasurer " holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earliest known written documentation of the chinese abacus dates to the 2nd century bc . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the chinese abacus , also known as the suanpan ( 算盤 / 算盘 , lit . " calculating tray " ) , is typically 20 cm tall and comes in various widths , depending on the operator . it usually has more than seven rods . there are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom one . the beads are usually rounded and made of hardwood . the beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam ; beads moved toward the beam are counted , while those moved away from it are not . one of the top beads is 5 , while one of the bottom beads is 1 . each rod has a number under it , showing the place value . the suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the prototype of the chinese abacus appeared during the han dynasty , and the beads are oval . the song dynasty and earlier used the 1 : 4 type or four - beads abacus similar to the modern abacus including the shape of the beads commonly known as japanese - style abacus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the early ming dynasty , the abacus began to appear in a 1 : 5 ratio . the upper deck had one bead and the bottom had five beads . in the late ming dynasty , the abacus styles appeared in a 2 : 5 ratio . the upper deck had two beads , and the bottom had five . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break various calculation techniques were devised for suanpan enabling efficient calculations . some schools teach students how to use it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the long scroll along the river during the qingming festival painted by zhang zeduan during the song dynasty ( 960–1297 ) , a suanpan is clearly visible beside an account book and doctors prescriptions on the counter of an apothecarys ( feibao ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the similarity of the roman abacus to the chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other , given evidence of a trade relationship between the roman empire and china . however , no direct connection has been demonstrated , and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental , both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand . where the roman model ( like most modern korean and japanese ) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place , the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2 . incidentally , this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system ( or any base up to 18 ) which may have been used for traditional chinese measures of weight . ( instead of running on wires as in the chinese , korean , and japanese models , the roman model used grooves , presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another possible source of the suanpan is chinese counting rods , which operated with a decimal system but lacked the concept of zero as a placeholder . the zero was probably introduced to the chinese in the tang dynasty ( 618–907 ) when travel in the indian ocean and the middle east would have provided direct contact with india , allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from indian merchants and mathematicians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the normal method of calculation in ancient rome , as in greece , was by moving counters on a smooth table . originally pebbles ( calculi ) were used . later , and in medieval europe , jetons were manufactured . marked lines indicated units , fives , tens , etcetera as in the roman numeral system . this system of ' counter casting ' continued into the late roman empire and in medieval europe and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century . due to pope sylvester iis reintroduction of the abacus with modifications , it became widely used in europe again during the 11th century this abacus used beads on wires , unlike the traditional roman counting boards , which meant the abacus could be used much faster and was more easily moved . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break writing in the 1st century bc , horace refers to the wax abacus , a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one example of archaeological evidence of the roman abacus , shown nearby in reconstruction , dates to the 1st century ad . it has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each . the groove marked i indicates units , x tens , and so on up to millions . the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives –five units , five tens , etcetera , essentially in a bi - quinary coded decimal system , related to the roman numerals . the short grooves on the right may have been used for marking roman " ounces " ( that is fractions ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the abhidharmakośabhāṣya of vasubandhu ( 316 - 396 ) , a sanskrit work on buddhist philosophy , says that the second - century ce philosopher vasumitra said that " placing a wick ( sanskrit vartikā ) on the number one ( ekāṅka ) means it is a one while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred , and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand " . it is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been . around the 5th century , indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the abacus . hindu texts used the term śūnya ( zero ) to indicate the empty column on the abacus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in japan , the abacus is called soroban ( 算盤 , そろばん , lit . " counting tray " ) . it was imported from china in the 14th century . it was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class adopted it , as the class structure obstructed such changes . the 1 : 4 abacus , which removes the seldom - used second and fifth bead became popular in the 1940s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break todays japanese abacus is a 1 : 4 type , four - bead abacus , introduced from china in the muromachi era . it adopts the form of the upper deck one bead and the bottom four beads . the top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is similar to the chinese or korean abacus , and the decimal number can be expressed , so the abacus is designed as a one : four device . the beads are always in the shape of a diamond . the quotient division is generally used instead of the division method ; at the same time , in order to make the multiplication and division digits consistently use the division multiplication . later , japan had a 3 : 5 abacus called 天三算盤 , which is now in the ize rongji collection of shansi village in yamagata city . japan also used a 2 : 5 type abacus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the four - bead abacus spread , and became common around the world . improvements to the japanese abacus arose in various places . in china an aluminium frame plastic bead abacus was used . the file is next to the four beads , and pressing the " clearing " button put the upper bead in the upper position , and the lower bead in the lower position . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the abacus is still manufactured in japan even with the proliferation , practicality , and affordability of pocket electronic calculators . the use of the soroban is still taught in japanese primary schools as part of mathematics , primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation . using visual imagery can complete a calculation as quickly as a physical instrument . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the chinese abacus migrated from china to korea around 1400 ad . koreans call it jupan ( 주판 ) , supan ( 수판 ) or jusan ( 주산 ) . the four - beads abacus ( 1 : 4 ) was introduced during the goryeo dynasty . the 5 : 1 abacus was introduced to korea from china during the ming dynasty . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some sources mention the use of an abacus called a nepohualtzintzin in ancient aztec culture . this mesoamerican abacus used a 5 - digit base - 20 system . the word nepōhualtzintzin comes from nahuatl , formed by the roots ; ne – personal - ; pōhual or pōhualli – the account - ; and tzintzin – small similar elements . its complete meaning was taken as : counting with small similar elements . its use was taught in the calmecac to the temalpouhqueh , who were students dedicated to taking the accounts of skies , from childhood . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the nepōhualtzintzin was divided into two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord . in the left part were four beads . beads in the first row have unitary values ( 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 ) , and on the right side , three beads had values of 5 , 10 , and 15 , respectively . in order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows , it is enough to multiply by 20 ( by each row ) , the value of the corresponding count in the first row . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the device featured 13 rows with 7 beads , 91 in total . this was a basic number for this culture . it had a close relation to natural phenomena , the underworld , and the cycles of the heavens . one nepōhualtzintzin ( 91 ) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts , two nepōhualtzitzin ( 182 ) is the number of days of the corns cycle , from its sowing to its harvest , three nepōhualtzintzin ( 273 ) is the number of days of a babys gestation , and four nepōhualtzintzin ( 364 ) completed a cycle and approximated one year . when translated into modern computer arithmetic , the nepōhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to 18 in floating point , which precisely calculated large and small amounts , although round off was not allowed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the rediscovery of the nepōhualtzintzin was due to the mexican engineer david esparza hidalgo , who in his travels throughout mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them in gold , jade , encrustations of shell , etcetera very old nepōhualtzintzin are attributed to the olmec culture , and some bracelets of mayan origin , as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sanchez wrote in arithmetic in maya that another base 5 , base 4 abacus had been found in the yucatán peninsula that also computed calendar data . this was a finger abacus , on one hand , 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 were used ; and on the other hand 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 were used . note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the quipu of the incas was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data , like advanced tally sticks – but not used to perform calculations . calculations were carried out using a yupana ( quechua for " counting tool " ; see figure ) which was still in use after the conquest of peru . the working principle of a yupana is unknown , but in 2001 italian mathematician de pasquale proposed an explanation . by comparing the form of several yupanas , researchers found that calculations were based using the fibonacci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 and powers of 10 , 20 , and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument . using the fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the russian abacus , the schoty ( , plural from , counting ) , usually has a single slanted deck , with ten beads on each wire ( except one wire with four beads for quarter - ruble fractions ) . older models have another 4 - bead wire for quarter - kopeks , which were minted until 1916 . the russian abacus is often used vertically , with each wire running horizontally . the wires are usually bowed upward in the center , to keep the beads pinned to either side . it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right . during manipulation , beads are moved to the left . for easy viewing , the middle 2 beads on each wire ( the 5th and 6th bead ) usually are of a different color from the other eight . likewise , the left bead of the thousands wire ( and the million wire , if present ) may have a different color . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the russian abacus was in use in shops and markets throughout the former soviet union , and its usage was taught in most schools until the 1990s . even the 1874 invention of mechanical calculator , odhner arithmometer , had not replaced them in russia ; according to yakov perelman . some businessmen attempting to import calculators into the russian empire were known to leave in despair after watching a skilled abacus operator . likewise , the mass production of felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce abacus use in the soviet union . the russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of domestic microcalculators in 1974 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the russian abacus was brought to france around 1820 by mathematician jean - victor poncelet , who had served in napoleons army and had been a prisoner of war in russia . the abacus had fallen out of use in western europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methods . to poncelets french contemporaries , it was something new . poncelet used it , not for any applied purpose , but as a teaching and demonstration aid . the turks and the armenian people used abacuses similar to the russian schoty . it was named a coulba by the turks and a choreb by the armenians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break around the world , abacuses have been used in pre - schools and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the numeral system and arithmetic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in western countries , a bead frame similar to the russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame is common ( see image ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the wireframe may be used either with positional notation like other abacuses ( thus the 10 - wire version may represent numbers up to 9999999999 ) , or each bead may represent one unit ( for example 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire , so numbers up to 100 may be represented ) . in the bead frame shown , the gap between the 5th and 6th wire , corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire , suggests the latter use . teaching multiplication , for example 6 times 7 , may be represented by shifting 7 beads on 6 wires . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the red - and - white abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of number - related lessons . the twenty bead version , referred to by its dutch name rekenrek ( " calculating frame " ) , is often used , either on a string of beads or on a rigid framework . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break physicist richard feynman was noted for facility in mathematical calculations . he wrote about an encounter in brazil with a japanese abacus expert , who challenged him to speed contests between feynmans pen and paper , and the abacus . the abacus was much faster for addition , somewhat faster for multiplication , but feynman was faster at division . when the abacus was used for a really difficult challenge , that is cube roots , feynman won easily . however , the number chosen at random was close to a number feynman happened to know was an exact cube , allowing him to use approximate methods . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break learning how to calculate with the abacus may improve capacity for mental calculation . abacus - based mental calculation ( amc ) , which was derived from the abacus , is the act of performing calculations , including addition , subtraction , multiplication , and division , in the mind by manipulating an imagined abacus . it is a high - level cognitive skill that runs calculations with an effective algorithm . people doing long - term amc training show higher numerical memory capacity and experience more effectively connected neural pathways . they are able to retrieve memory to deal with complex processes . amc involves both visuospatial and visuomotor processing that generate the visual abacus and move the imaginary beads . since it only requires that the final position of beads be remembered , it takes less memory and less computation time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers . the abacus shows how numbers , letters , and signs can be stored in a binary system on a computer , or via ascii . the device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows . the beads represent a switch on the computer in either an " on " or " off " position . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an adapted abacus , invented by tim cranmer , and called a cranmer abacus is commonly used by visually impaired users . a piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads , keeping them in place while the users manipulate them . the device is then used to perform the mathematical functions of multiplication , division , addition , subtraction , square root , and cube root . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although blind students have benefited from talking calculators , the abacus is often taught to these students in early grades . blind students can also complete mathematical assignments using a braille - writer and nemeth code ( a type of braille code for mathematics ) but large multiplication and long division problems are tedious . the abacus gives these students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper . many blind people find this number machine a useful tool throughout life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 53: Acid ***********

an acid is a molecule or ion capable of either donating a proton ( that is hydrogen ion , h ) , known as a brønsted–lowry acid , or forming a covalent bond with an electron pair , known as a lewis acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first category of acids are the proton donors , or brønsted–lowry acids . in the special case of aqueous solutions , proton donors form the hydronium ion h3o and are known as arrhenius acids . brønsted and lowry generalized the arrhenius theory to include non - aqueous solvents . a brønsted or arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aqueous arrhenius acids have characteristic properties that provide a practical description of an acid . acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste , can turn blue litmus red , and react with bases and certain metals ( like calcium ) to form salts . the word acid is derived from the latin acidus / acēre , meaning ' sour ' . an aqueous solution of an acid has a ph less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as " acid " ( as in " dissolved in acid " ) , while the strict definition refers only to the solute . a lower ph means a higher acidity , and thus a higher concentration of positive hydrogen ions in the solution . chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid ( a solution of hydrogen chloride that is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes ) , acetic acid ( vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid ) , sulfuric acid ( used in car batteries ) , and citric acid ( found in citrus fruits ) . as these examples show , acids ( in the colloquial sense ) can be solutions or pure substances , and can be derived from acids ( in the strict sense ) that are solids , liquids , or gases . strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive , but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the second category of acids are lewis acids , which form a covalent bond with an electron pair . an example is boron trifluoride ( bf3 ) , whose boron atom has a vacant orbital that can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base , for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia ( nh3 ) . lewis considered this as a generalization of the brønsted definition , so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons ( h ) into the solution , which then accept electron pairs . hydrogen chloride , acetic acid , and most other brønsted–lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair , however , and are therefore not lewis acids . conversely , many lewis acids are not arrhenius or brønsted–lowry acids . in modern terminology , an acid is implicitly a brønsted acid and not a lewis acid , since chemists almost always refer to a lewis acid explicitly as a lewis acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions , or can be dissolved in water , so the arrhenius and brønsted–lowry definitions are the most relevant . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the brønsted–lowry definition is the most widely used definition ; unless otherwise specified , acid–base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton ( h ) from an acid to a base . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions . although alcohols and amines can be brønsted–lowry acids , they can also function as lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1884 , svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions ( h ) , later described as protons or hydrons . an arrhenius acid is a substance that , when added to water , increases the concentration of h ions in the water . note that chemists often write h ( aq ) and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing acid–base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus , a proton , does not exist alone in water , it exists as the hydronium ion ( h3o ) or other forms ( h5o2 , h9o4 ) . thus , an arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water . examples include molecular substances such as hydrogen chloride and acetic acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an arrhenius base , on the other hand , is a substance that increases the concentration of hydroxide ( oh− ) ions when dissolved in water . this decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form h2o molecules : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to this equilibrium , any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide . thus , an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration , while an arrhenius base increases it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in an acidic solution , the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10−7 moles per liter . since ph is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions , acidic solutions thus have a ph of less than 7 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions , it is also quite limited in its scope . in 1923 , chemists johannes nicolaus brønsted and thomas martin lowry independently recognized that acid–base reactions involve the transfer of a proton . a brønsted–lowry acid ( or simply brønsted acid ) is a species that donates a proton to a brønsted–lowry base . brønsted–lowry acid–base theory has several advantages over arrhenius theory . consider the following reactions of acetic acid ( ch3cooh ) , the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break both theories easily describe the first reaction : ch3cooh acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of h3o when dissolved in water , and it acts as a brønsted acid by donating a proton to water . in the second example ch3cooh undergoes the same transformation , in this case donating a proton to ammonia ( nh3 ) , but does not relate to the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium . nevertheless , ch3cooh is both an arrhenius and a brønsted–lowry acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break brønsted–lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of molecular compounds in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase . hydrogen chloride ( hcl ) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride , nh4cl . in aqueous solution hcl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions . the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrheniuss definition : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as with the acetic acid reactions , both definitions work for the first example , where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the hcl solute . the next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton - transfer reactions . in the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia ( dissolved in benzene ) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous hcl and nh3 combine to form the solid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a third , only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by gilbert lewis , which includes reactions with acid–base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer . a lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species ; in other words , it is an electron pair acceptor . brønsted acid–base reactions are proton transfer reactions while lewis acid–base reactions are electron pair transfers . many lewis acids are not brønsted–lowry acids . contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid–base chemistry : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the first reaction a fluoride ion , f− , gives up an electron pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate . fluoride " loses " a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the b—f bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic nuclei and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion . bf3 is a lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride . this reaction cannot be described in terms of brønsted theory because there is no proton transfer . the second reaction can be described using either theory . a proton is transferred from an unspecified brønsted acid to ammonia , a brønsted base ; alternatively , ammonia acts as a lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion . the species that gains the electron pair is the lewis acid ; for example , the oxygen atom in h3o gains a pair of electrons when one of the h—o bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen . depending on the context , a lewis acid may also be described as an oxidizer or an electrophile . organic brønsted acids , such as acetic , citric , or oxalic acid , are not lewis acids . they dissociate in water to produce a lewis acid , h , but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a lewis base ( acetate , citrate , or oxalate , respectively , for the acids mentioned ) . this article deals mostly with brønsted acids rather than lewis acids . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reactions of acids are often generalized in the form , where ha represents the acid and a− is the conjugate base . this reaction is referred to as protolysis . the protonated form ( ha ) of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the free acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acid–base conjugate pairs differ by one proton , and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton ( protonation and deprotonation , respectively ) . note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as . in solution there exists an equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base . the equilibrium constant k is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution . brackets indicate concentration , such that h2o means the concentration of h2o . the acid dissociation constant ka is generally used in the context of acid–base reactions . the numerical value of ka is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants , where the reactant is the acid ( ha ) and the products are the conjugate base and uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the stronger of two acids will have a higher ka than the weaker acid ; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton . because the range of possible values for ka spans many orders of magnitude , a more manageable constant , pka is more frequently used , where pka minus ; log10 ka . stronger acids have a smaller pka than weaker acids . experimentally determined pka at 25°c in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arrhenius acids are named according to their anions . in the classical naming system , the ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix , according to the table following . the prefix " hydro - " is used when the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element . for example , hcl has chloride as its anion , so the hydro - prefix is used , and the - ide suffix makes the name take the form hydrochloric acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break classical naming system : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the iupac naming system , " aqueous " is simply added to the name of the ionic compound . thus , for hydrogen chloride , as an acid solution , the iupac name is aqueous hydrogen chloride . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton . a strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water ; in other words , one mole of a strong acid ha dissolves in water yielding one mole of h and one mole of the conjugate base , a− , and none of the protonated acid ha . in contrast , a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution . examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) , hydroiodic acid ( hi ) , hydrobromic acid ( hbr ) , perchloric acid ( hclo4 ) , nitric acid ( hno3 ) and sulfuric acid ( h2so4 ) . in water each of these essentially ionizes 100 . the stronger an acid is , the more easily it loses a proton , two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the polarity of the h—a bond and the size of atom a , which determines the strength of the h—a bond . acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break stronger acids have a larger acid dissociation constant , ka and a more negative pka than weaker acids . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sulfonic acids , which are organic oxyacids , are a class of strong acids . a common example is toluenesulfonic acid ( tosylic acid ) . unlike sulfuric acid itself , sulfonic acids can be solids . in fact , polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break superacids are acids stronger than 100 sulfuric acid . examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid , magic acid and perchloric acid . superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic , crystalline hydronium " salts " . they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while ka measures the strength of an acid compound , the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph , which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution . the ph of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compounds ka . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lewis acids have been classified in the ecw model and it has been shown that there is no one order of acid strengths . the relative acceptor strength of lewis acids toward a series of bases , versus other lewis acids , can be illustrated by c - b plots . it has been shown that to define the order of lewis acid strength at least two properties must be considered . for pearsons qualitative hsab theory the two properties are hardness and strength while for dragos quantitative ecw model the two properties are electrostatic and covalent . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break monoprotic acids , also known as monobasic acids , are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation ( sometimes called ionization ) as shown below ( symbolized by ha ) : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid ( hcl ) and nitric acid ( hno3 ) . on the other hand , for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid . examples in organic acids include formic acid ( hcooh ) , acetic acid ( ch3cooh ) and benzoic acid ( c6h5cooh ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break polyprotic acids , also known as polybasic acids , are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule , in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule . specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names , such as diprotic ( or dibasic ) acid ( two potential protons to donate ) , and triprotic ( or tribasic ) acid ( three potential protons to donate ) . some macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids can have a very large number of acidic protons . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a diprotic acid ( here symbolized by h2a ) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph . each dissociation has its own dissociation constant , ka1 and ka2 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second ( that is , ka1 gt ; ka2 ) . for example , sulfuric acid ( h2so4 ) can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion ( hso ) , for which ka1 is very large ; then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion ( so ) , wherein the ka2 is intermediate strength . the large ka1 for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid . in a similar manner , the weak unstable carbonic acid can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion and lose a second to form carbonate anion ( co ) . both ka values are small , but ka1 gt ; ka2 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a triprotic acid ( h3a ) can undergo one , two , or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants , where ka1 gt ; ka2 gt ; ka3 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid ( h3po4 ) , usually just called phosphoric acid . all three protons can be successively lost to yield h2po , then hpo , and finally po , the orthophosphate ion , usually just called phosphate . even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent , the successive ka values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged . an organic example of a triprotic acid is citric acid , which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable , all of the conjugate bases are present in solution . the fractional concentration , α ( alpha ) , for each species can be calculated . for example , a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution : h2a , ha− , and a2− . the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph ( which can be converted to the h ) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alphaceh2a fracceh2ceh2 cehk1 k1 k2 fracceh2ace ha - a2 - uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alphaceha - fraccehk1ceh2 cehk1 k1 k2 fracceha - ceh2aha - a2 - uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alphacea2 - frack1 k2ceh2 cehk1 k1 k2 fraccea2 - ceha - a2 - uvmr_ev_paragraph_break endalign uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph , for given k1 and k2 , is known as a bjerrum plot . a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n - protic acid that has been deprotonated i - times : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alphace hn - i ai - cehn - i displaystyle prodj0ikj over displaystyle sumi0n bigcehn - i displaystyle prodj0ikj big uvmr_ev_paragraph_break where k0 1 and the other k - terms are the dissociation constants for the acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base , producing a salt and neutralized base ; for example , hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break neutralization is the basis of titration , where a ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid . it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with ph 7 , which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt . an example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride , which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia . conversely , neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt ( for example , sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in order for a protonated acid to lose a proton , the ph of the system must rise above the pka of the acid . the decreased concentration of h in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form ( the deprotonated form of the acid ) . in lower - ph ( more acidic ) solutions , there is a high enough h concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution , an acid–base titration is commonly performed . a strong base solution with a known concentration , usually naoh or koh , is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added . the titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes , with the base volume on the x - axis and the solutions ph value on the y - axis . the ph of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for each diprotic acid titration curve , from left to right , there are two midpoints , two equivalence points , and two buffer regions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to the successive dissociation processes , there are two equivalence points in the titration curve of a diprotic acid . the first equivalence point occurs when all first hydrogen ions from the first ionization are titrated . in other words , the amount of oh− added equals the original amount of h2a at the first equivalence point . the second equivalence point occurs when all hydrogen ions are titrated . therefore , the amount of oh− added equals twice the amount of h2a at this time . for a weak diprotic acid titrated by a strong base , the second equivalence point must occur at ph above 7 due to the hydrolysis of the resulted salts in the solution . at either equivalence point , adding a drop of base will cause the steepest rise of the ph value in the system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a titration curve for a diprotic acid contains two midpoints where phpka . since there are two different ka values , the first midpoint occurs at phpka1 and the second one occurs at phpka2 . each segment of the curve that contains a midpoint at its center is called the buffer region . because the buffer regions consist of the acid and its conjugate base , it can resist ph changes when base is added until the next equivalent points . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acids exist universally in our lives . there are both numerous kinds of natural acid compounds with biological functions and massive synthesized acids , which are used in many ways . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acids are fundamental reagents in treating almost all processes in todays industry . sulfuric acid , a diprotic acid , is the most widely used acid in industry , and is also the most - produced industrial chemical in the world . it is mainly used in producing fertilizer , detergent , batteries and dyes , as well as used in processing many products such like removing impurities . according to the statistics data in 2011 , the annual production of sulfuric acid was around 200 million tonnes in the world . for example , phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers , and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid , purifying the solution and electrowinning . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the chemical industry , acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts . for example , nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate , a fertilizer . additionally , carboxylic acids can be esterified with alcohols , to produce esters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling . they may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery , such as sulfuric acid in a car battery . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind . natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids . citric acid is present in oranges , lemon and other citrus fruits . oxalic acid is present in tomatoes , spinach , and especially in carambola and rhubarb ; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid . ascorbic acid ( vitamin c ) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla ( indian gooseberry ) , lemon , citrus fruits , and guava . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many acids can be found in various kinds of food as additives , as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives . phosphoric acid , for example , is a component of cola drinks . acetic acid is used in day - to - day life as vinegar . citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break carbonic acid is one of the most common acid additives that are widely added in soft drinks . during the manufacturing process , co2 is usually pressurized to dissolve in these drinks to generate carbonic acid . carbonic acid is very unstable and tends to decompose into water and co2 at room temperature and pressure . therefore , when bottles or cans of these kinds of soft drinks are opened , the soft drinks fizz and effervesce as co2 bubbles come out . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break certain acids are used as drugs . acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acids play important roles in the human body . the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules . amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues . fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues . nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of dna and rna and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes . carbonic acid is important for maintenance of ph equilibrium in the body . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break human bodies contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds , among those dicarboxylic acids play an essential role in many biological behaviors . many of those acids are amino acids , which mainly serve as materials for the synthesis of proteins . other weak acids serve as buffers with their conjugate bases to keep the bodys ph from undergoing large scale changes that would be harmful to cells . the rest of the dicarboxylic acids also participate in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds in human bodies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic chemistry ; for example , sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline . some acids , such as sulfuric , phosphoric , and hydrochloric acids , also effect dehydration and condensation reactions . in biochemistry , many enzymes employ acid catalysis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break basic structure of an ' acid . many biologically important molecules are acids . nucleic acids , which contain acidic phosphate groups , include dna and rna . nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organisms characteristics , and is passed from parents to offspring . dna contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins , which are made up of amino acid subunits . cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an α - amino acid has a central carbon ( the α or alpha carbon ) that is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group ( thus they are carboxylic acids ) , an amino group , a hydrogen atom and a variable group . the variable group , also called the r group or side chain , determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid . in glycine , the simplest amino acid , the r group is a hydrogen atom , but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens , and may contain other elements such as sulfur , oxygen or nitrogen . with the exception of glycine , naturally occurring amino acids are chiral and almost invariably occur in the l - configuration . peptidoglycan , found in some bacterial cell walls contains some d - amino acids . at physiological ph , typically around 7 , free amino acids exist in a charged form , where the acidic carboxyl group ( - cooh ) loses a proton ( - coo− ) and the basic amine group ( - nh2 ) gains a proton ( - nh ) . the entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion , with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains . aspartic acid , for example , possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups , for a net charge of −1 at physiological ph . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology . these contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end . the cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer , a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar , hydrophilic phosphate " head " groups . membranes contain additional components , some of which can participate in acid–base reactions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in humans and many other animals , hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides , as well as converting the inactive pro - enzyme , pepsinogen into the enzyme , pepsin . some organisms produce acids for defense ; for example , ants produce formic acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break acid–base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing . oxygen gas ( o2 ) drives cellular respiration , the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food , producing carbon dioxide ( co2 ) as a byproduct . oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs , and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation . for example , during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat , releasing co2 into the blood stream . in aqueous solutions such as blood co2 exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is the decrease in ph that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper , expelling the excess co2 and resupplying the cells with o2 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ' ( acetylsalicylic ' , ' acid ) ' , ' is ' , ' a ' , ' carboxylic ' , ' acid ' cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged or large , polar molecules because of the lipophilic fatty acyl chains comprising their interior . many biologically important molecules , including a number of pharmaceutical agents , are organic weak acids that can cross the membrane in their protonated , uncharged form but not in their charged form ( that is , as the conjugate base ) . for this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods . the charged form , however , is often more soluble in blood and cytosol , both aqueous environments . when the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral ph within the cell , certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble , allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer . acids that lose a proton at the intracellular ph will exist in their soluble , charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target . ibuprofen , aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a sulfonic acid has the general formula rs ( o ) 2–oh , where r is an organic radical . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a carboxylic acid has the general formula r - c ( o ) oh , where r is an organic radical . the carboxyl group - c ( o ) oh contains a carbonyl group , co , and a hydroxyl group , o - h . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break halogenation at alpha position increases acid strength , so that the following acids are all stronger than acetic acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group . in vinylogous carboxylic acids , a carbon - carbon double bond separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 54: Asphalt ***********

asphalt , also known as bitumen ( , ) , is a sticky , black , highly viscous liquid or semi - solid form of petroleum . it may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product , and is classed as a pitch . before the 20th century , the term asphaltum was also used . the word is derived from the ancient greek ἄσφαλτος ásphaltos . the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world , estimated to contain 10 million tons , is the pitch lake located in la brea in southwest trinidad ( antilles island located on the northeastern coast of venezuela ) , within the siparia regional corporation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the primary use ( 70 ) of asphalt is in road construction , where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete . its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products , including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in material sciences and engineering , the terms " asphalt " and " bitumen " are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance , although there is regional variation as to which term is most common . worldwide , geologists tend to favor the term " bitumen " for the naturally occurring material . for the manufactured material , which is a refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils , " bitumen " is the prevalent term in much of the world ; however , in american english , " asphalt " is more commonly used . to help avoid confusion , the phrases " liquid asphalt " , " asphalt binder " , or " asphalt cement " are used in the colloquially , various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as " tar " , as in the name of the la brea tar pits , although tar is a different material . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term " crude bitumen " . its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at 525 c is sometimes referred to as " refined bitumen " . the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves of natural asphalt in the athabasca oil sands , which cover 142000 km2 , an area larger than england . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asphalt properties change with temperature , which means that there is a specific range where viscosity permits adequate compaction by providing lubrication between particles during the compaction process . low temperature prevents aggregate particles from moving , and the required density is not possible to achieve . computer simulations of simplified model systems are able to reproduce some of asphalts characteristic properties . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word " asphalt " is derived from the late middle english , in turn from french asphalte , based on late latin asphalton , asphaltum , which is the latinisation of the greek ἄσφαλτος ( ásphaltos , ásphalton ) , a word meaning " asphalt / bitumen / pitch " , which perhaps derives from ἀ - , " not , without " , that is the alpha privative , and σφάλλειν ( sphallein ) , " to cause to fall , baffle , ( in passive ) err , ( in passive ) be balked of " . the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining various objects , and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application . specifically , herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wall . from the greek , the word passed into late latin , and thence into french ( asphalte ) and english ( " asphaltum " and " asphalt " ) . in french , the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring asphalt - soaked limestone deposits , and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the " asphaltic concrete " used to pave roads . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word " bitumen " is from latin , and passed via french into english . the latin word traces to the proto - indo - european root gʷet - " pitch " ; see that link for other cognates . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in british english , " bitumen " is used instead of " asphalt " . the word " asphalt " is instead used to refer to asphalt concrete , a mixture of construction aggregate and asphalt itself ( also called " tarmac " in common parlance ) . bitumen mixed with clay was usually called " asphaltum " , but the term is less commonly used today . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in australian english , the word " asphalt " is used to describe a mix of construction aggregate . " bitumen " refers to the liquid derived from the heavy - residues from crude oil distillation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in american english , " asphalt " is equivalent to the british " bitumen " . however , " asphalt " is also commonly used as a shortened form of " asphalt concrete " ( therefore equivalent to the british " asphalt " or " tarmac " ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in canadian english , the word " bitumen " is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil , while " asphalt " is used for the oil refinery product . diluted bitumen ( diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines ) is known as " dilbit " in the canadian petroleum industry , while bitumen " upgraded " to synthetic crude oil is known as " syncrude " , and syncrude blended with bitumen is called " synbit " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " bitumen " is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or semi - solid form of petroleum . " bituminous rock " is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen . the oil sands of alberta , canada are a similar material . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break neither of the terms " asphalt " or " bitumen " should be confused with tar or coal tars . tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and pyrolysis of organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses , whether fossilized as with coal , or freshly harvested . the majority of bitumen , on the other hand , was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited by water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the diagenetic point , where the disorganized fatty hydrocarbon molecules joined in long chains in the absence of oxygen . bitumen occurs as a solid or highly viscous liquid . it may even be mixed in with coal deposits . bitumen , and coal using the bergius process , can be refined into petrols such as gasoline , and bitumen may be distilled into tar , not the other way around . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the components of asphalt include four main classes of compounds : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the naphthene aromatics and polar aromatics are typically the majority components . most natural bitumens also contain organosulfur compounds , resulting in an overall sulfur content of up to 4 . nickel and vanadium are found at uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the substance is soluble in carbon disulfide . it is commonly modelled as a colloid , with asphaltenes as the dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase . " it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt , because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely large " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asphalt may be confused with coal tar , which is a visually similar black , thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal . during the early and mid - 20th century , when town gas was produced , coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates . the addition of coal tar to macadam roads led to the word " tarmac " , which is now used in common parlance to refer to road - making materials . however , since the 1970s , when natural gas succeeded town gas , asphalt has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications . other examples of this confusion include the la brea tar pits and the canadian oil sands , both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar . " pitch " is another term sometimes informally used at times to refer to asphalt , as in pitch lake . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for economic and other reasons , asphalt is sometimes sold combined with other materials , often without being labeled as anything other than simply " asphalt " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break of particular note is the use of re - refined engine oil bottoms – " reob " or " reobs " the residue of recycled automotive engine oil collected from the bottoms of re - refining vacuum distillation towers , in the manufacture of asphalt . reob contains various elements and compounds found in recycled engine oil : additives to the original oil and materials accumulating from its circulation in the engine ( typically iron and copper ) . some research has indicated a correlation between this adulteration of asphalt and poorer - performing pavement . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum . nonetheless , large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature . naturally occurring deposits of bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient , microscopic algae ( diatoms ) and other once - living things . these natural deposits of bitumen have been formed during the carboniferous period , when giant swamp forests dominated many parts of the earth . they were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived . under the heat ( above 50°c ) and pressure of burial deep in the earth , the remains were transformed into materials such as bitumen , kerogen , or petroleum . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break natural deposits of bitumen include lakes such as the pitch lake in trinidad and tobago and lake bermudez in venezuela . natural seeps occur in the la brea tar pits and the mckittrick tar pits in california , as well as in the dead sea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as " oil sands " in alberta , canada , and the similar " tar sands " in utah , us . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves , in three huge deposits covering 142000 km2 , an area larger than england or new york state . these bituminous sands contain 166 goilbbl of commercially established oil reserves , giving canada the third largest oil reserves in the world . although historically it was used without refining to pave roads , nearly all of the output is now used as raw material for oil refineries in canada and the united states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the worlds largest deposit of natural bitumen , known as the athabasca oil sands , is located in the mcmurray formation of northern alberta . this formation is from the early cretaceous , and is composed of numerous lenses of oil - bearing sand with up to 20 oil . isotopic studies show the oil deposits to be about 110 million years old . two smaller but still very large formations occur in the peace river oil sands and the cold lake oil sands , to the west and southeast of the athabasca oil sands , respectively . of the alberta deposits , only parts of the athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining . the other 80 has to be produced by oil wells using enhanced oil recovery techniques like steam - assisted gravity drainage . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break much smaller heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the uinta basin in utah , us . the tar sand triangle deposit , for example , is roughly 6 bitumen . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bitumen may occur in hydrothermal veins . an example of this is within the uinta basin of utah , in the us , where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed gilsonite . these veins formed by the polymerization and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the green river formation during burial and diagenesis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites . however , detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct . the vast alberta bitumen resources are considered to have started out as living material from marine plants and animals , mainly algae , that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered alberta . they were covered by mud , buried deeply over time , and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of 50 due to pressure from the rising of the rocky mountains in southwestern alberta , 80 to 55 million years ago , the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches , thus forming the oil sands . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the use of natural bitumen for waterproofing , and as an adhesive dates at least to the fifth millennium bc , with a crop storage basket discovered in mehrgarh , of the indus valley civilization , lined with it . by the 3rd millennium bc refined rock asphalt was in use in the region , and was used to waterproof the great bath in mohenjo - daro . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the ancient middle east , the sumerians used natural bitumen deposits for mortar between bricks and stones , to cement parts of carvings , such as eyes , into place , for ship caulking , and for waterproofing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 1 km long euphrates tunnel beneath the river euphrates at babylon in the time of queen semiramis was reportedly constructed of burnt bricks covered with bitumen as a waterproofing agent . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bitumen was used by ancient egyptians to embalm mummies . the persian word for asphalt is moom , which is related to the english word mummy . the egyptians ' primary source of bitumen was the dead sea , which the romans knew as palus asphaltites ( asphalt lake ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in approximately 40 ad , dioscorides described the dead sea material as judaicum bitumen , and noted other places in the region where it could be found . the sidon bitumen is thought to refer to material found at hasbeya in lebanon . pliny also refers to bitumen being found in epirus . bitumen was a valuable strategic resource . it was the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit – between the seleucids and the nabateans in 312 bc . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the ancient far east , natural bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fractions , leaving a thermoplastic material of higher molecular weight that when layered on objects became quite hard upon cooling . this was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing , such as scabbards and other items statuettes of household deities were also cast with this type of material in japan , and probably also in china . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in north america , archaeological recovery has indicated that bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone projectile points to wooden shafts . in canada , aboriginal people used bitumen seeping out of the banks of the athabasca and other rivers to waterproof birch bark canoes , and also heated it in smudge pots to ward off mosquitoes in the summer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1553 , pierre belon described in his work observations that pissasphalto , a mixture of pitch and bitumen , was used in the republic of ragusa ( now dubrovnik , croatia ) for tarring of ships . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an 1838 edition of mechanics magazine cites an early use of asphalt in france . a pamphlet dated 1621 , by " a certain monsieur deyrinys , states that he had discovered the existence ( of asphaltum ) in large quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel " , and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways – " principally in the construction of air - proof granaries , and in protecting , by means of the arches , the water - courses in the city of paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth " , which at that time made the water unusable . " he expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces " in palaces , " the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a parisian of that generation " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break but the substance was generally neglected in france until the revolution of 1830 . in the 1830s there was a surge of interest , and asphalt became widely used " for pavements , flat roofs , and the lining of cisterns , and in england , some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes " . its rise in europe was " a sudden phenomenon " , after natural deposits were found " in france at osbann ( bas - rhin ) , the parc ( ain ) and the puy - de - la - poix ( puy - de - dôme ) " , although it could also be made artificially . one of the earliest uses in france was the laying of about 24000 square yards of seyssel asphalt at the place de la concorde in 1835 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break among the earlier uses of bitumen in the united kingdom was for etching . william salmons polygraphice ( 1673 ) provides a recipe for varnish used in etching , consisting of three ounces of virgin wax , two ounces of mastic , and one ounce of asphaltum . by the fifth edition in 1685 , he had included more asphaltum recipes from other sources . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first british patent for the use of asphalt was " cassells patent asphalte or bitumen " in 1834 . having seen it employed in france and belgium when visiting with frederick walter simms , who worked with him on the introduction of asphalt to britain . dr lamb phipson writes that his father , samuel ryland phipson , a friend of claridge , was also " instrumental in introducing the asphalte pavement ( in 1836 ) " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break claridge obtained a patent in scotland on 27 march 1838 , and obtained a patent in ireland on 23 april 1838 . in 1851 , extensions for the 1837 patent and for both 1838 patents were sought by the trustees of a company previously formed by claridge . claridges patent asphalte companyformed in 1838 for the purpose of introducing to britain " asphalte in its natural state from the mine at pyrimont seysell in france " , cite book dateoctober 1837 – december 1838 titlethe civil engineer and architects journal chapterjoint stock companies ( description of asphalte use by claridges company ) volume1 locationlondon page199 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1838 , there was a flurry of entrepreneurial activity involving asphalt , which had uses beyond paving . for example , asphalt could also be used for flooring , damp proofing in buildings , and for waterproofing of various types of pools and baths , both of which were also proliferating in the 19th century . one of the earliest surviving examples of its use can be seen at highgate cemetery where it was used in 1839 to seal the roof of the terrace catacombs . on the london stockmarket , there were various claims as to the exclusivity of asphalt quality from france , germany and england . and numerous patents were granted in france , with similar numbers of patent applications being denied in england due to their similarity to each other . in england , " claridges was the type most used in the 1840s and 50s " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1914 , claridges company entered into a joint venture to produce tar - bound macadam , with materials manufactured through a subsidiary company called clarmac roads ltd . two products resulted , namely clarmac , and clarphalte , with the former being manufactured by clarmac roads and the latter by claridges patent asphalte co . although clarmac was more widely used . however , the first world war ruined the clarmac company , which entered into liquidation in 1915 . the failure of clarmac roads ltd had a flow - on effect to claridges company , which was itself compulsorily wound up , ceasing operations in 1917 , having invested a substantial amount of funds into the new venture , both at the outset and in a subsequent attempt to save the clarmac company . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bitumen was thought in 19th century britain to contain chemicals with medicinal properties . extracts from bitumen were used to treat catarrh and some forms of asthma and as a remedy against worms , especially the tapeworm . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first use of bitumen in the new world was by indigenous peoples . on the west coast , as early as the 13th century , the tongva , luiseño and chumash peoples collected the naturally occurring bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits . all three groups used the substance as an adhesive . it is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items for example , it was used on rattles to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles . it was also used in decorations . small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations . it was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water , possibly poisoning those who drank the water . asphalt was used also to seal the planks on ocean - going canoes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asphalt was first used to pave streets in the 1870s . at first naturally occurring " bituminous rock " was used , such as at ritchie mines in macfarlan in ritchie county , west virginia from 1852 to 1873 . in 1876 , asphalt - based paving was used to pave pennsylvania avenue in washington dc , in time for the celebration of the national centennial . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the horse - drawn era , us streets were mostly unpaved and covered with dirt or gravel . especially where mud or trenching often made streets difficult to pass , pavements were sometimes made of diverse materials including wooden planks , cobble stones or other stone blocks , or bricks . unpaved roads produced uneven wear and hazards for pedestrians . in the late 19th century with the rise of the popular bicycle , bicycle clubs were important in pushing for more general pavement of streets . advocacy for pavement increased in the early 20th century with the rise of the automobile . asphalt gradually became an ever more common method of paving . st . charles avenue in new orleans was paved its whole length with asphalt by 1889 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1900 , manhattan alone had 130000 horses , pulling streetcars , wagons , and carriages , and leaving their waste behind . they were not fast , and pedestrians could dodge and scramble their way across the crowded streets . small towns continued to rely on dirt and gravel , but larger cities wanted much better streets . they looked to wood or granite blocks by the 1850s . in 1890 , a third of chicagos 2000 miles of streets were paved , chiefly with wooden blocks , which gave better traction than mud . brick surfacing was a good compromise , but even better was asphalt paving , which was easy to install and to cut through to get at sewers . with london and paris serving as models , washington laid 400000 square yards of asphalt paving by 1882 ; it became the model for buffalo , philadelphia and elsewhere . by the end of the century , american cities boasted 30 million square yards of asphalt paving , well ahead of brick . the streets became faster and more dangerous so electric traffic lights were installed . electric trolleys ( at 12 miles per hour ) became the main transportation service for middle class shoppers and office workers until they bought automobiles after 1945 and commuted from more distant suburbs in privacy and comfort on asphalt highways . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break canada has the worlds largest deposit of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands , and canadian first nations along the athabasca river had long used it to waterproof their canoes . in 1719 , a cree named wa - pa - su brought a sample for trade to henry kelsey of the hudsons bay company , who was the first recorded european to see it . however , it wasnt until 1787 that fur trader and explorer alexander mackenzie saw the athabasca oil sands and said , " at about 24 miles from the fork ( of the athabasca and clearwater rivers ) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the value of the deposit was obvious from the start , but the means of extracting the bitumen was not . the nearest town , fort mcmurray , alberta , was a small fur trading post , other markets were far away , and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving . in 1915 , sidney ells of the federal mines branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in edmonton , alberta . other roads in alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands , but it was generally not economic . during the 1920s dr . karl clark of the alberta research council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur robert fitzsimmons built the bitumount oil separation plant , which between 1925 and 1958 produced up to 300 oilbbl per day of bitumen using dr . clarks method . most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs , but other uses included fuels , lubrication oils , printers ink , medicines , rust - and acid - proof paints , fireproof roofing , street paving , patent leather , and fence post preservatives . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bitumen was used in early photographic technology . in 1826 , or 1827 , it was used by french scientist joseph nicéphore niépce to make the oldest surviving photograph from nature . the bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera . exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble , so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light - struck areas remained . many hours of exposure in the camera were required , making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography , but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century . although widely used for a time , it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting , especially when mixed with the most common diluents , such as linseed oil , varnish and turpentine . unless thoroughly diluted , bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact . the use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings , for instance those of delacroix . perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is théodore géricaults raft of the medusa ( 1818–1819 ) , where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the vast majority of refined asphalt is used in construction : primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications . according to the requirements of the end use , asphalt is produced to specification . this is achieved either by refining or blending . it is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year . approximately 85 of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder in asphalt concrete for roads . it is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways , car parks and footways . typically , the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse aggregates such as sand , gravel and crushed rock with asphalt , which acts as the binding agent . other materials , such as recycled polymers ( for example , rubber tyres ) , may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a further 10 of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications , where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the remaining 5 of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials , such as pipe coatings , carpet tile backing and paint . asphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures , systems , and components , such as the following : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the largest use of asphalt is for making asphalt concrete for road surfaces ; this accounts for approximately 85 of the asphalt consumed in the united states . there are about 4000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the us , and a similar number in europe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5 asphalt cement and 95 aggregates ( stone , sand , and gravel ) . due to its highly viscous nature , asphalt cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility . the temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt and the aggregates , but warm - mix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the weight of an asphalt pavement depends upon the aggregate type , the asphalt , and the air void content . an average example in the united states is about 112 pounds per square yard , per inch of pavement thickness . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements , such as milling to remove a worn or damaged surface , the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures . the asphalt in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes . with some 95 of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt , a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year . according to industry surveys conducted annually by the federal highway administration and the national asphalt pavement association , more than 99 of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements , roadbeds , shoulders and embankments or stockpiled for future use . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world . due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly , it is widely used for runways . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt ( asphalt concrete ) in that it has a higher asphalt ( binder ) content , usually around 7–10 of the whole aggregate mix , as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete , which has only around 5 asphalt . this thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground . mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of 210 °c and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about 20 mm thick . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a number of technologies allow asphalt to be applied at mild temperatures . the viscosity can be lowered by emulsfying the asphalt by the addition of fatty amines . 2–25 is the content of these emulsifying agents . the cationic amines enhance the binding of the asphalt to the surface of the crushed rock . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications . chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock , gravel or crushed slag . slurry seal is a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road . cold - mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot - mixed asphalt , several inches in depth , and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot - mix asphalt to create low - cost pavements . bitumen emulsion based techniques are known to be useful for all classes of roads , their use may also be possible in the following applications : 1 . asphalts for heavily trafficked roads ( based on the use of polymer modified emulsions ) 2 . warm emulsion based mixtures , to improve both their maturation time and mechanical properties 3 . half - warm technology , in which aggregates are heated up to 100 degrees , producing mixtures with similar properties to those of hot asphalts 4 . high performance surface dressing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break synthetic crude oil , also known as syncrude , is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in canada . bituminous sands are mined using enormous ( 100 - ton capacity ) power shovels and loaded into even larger ( 400 - ton capacity ) dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility . the process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by dr . karl clark of the university of alberta during the 1920s . after extraction from the sand , the bitumen is fed into a bitumen upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent . this synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment . by 2015 canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over 1 moilbbl per day of synthetic crude oil , of which 75 was exported to oil refineries in the united states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in alberta , five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products : the suncor energy upgrader near fort mcmurray , alberta produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel ; the syncrude canada , canadian natural resources , and nexen upgraders near fort mcmurray produce synthetic crude oil ; and the shell scotford upgrader near edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby shell oil refinery . a sixth upgrader , under construction in 2015 near redwater , alberta , will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel , with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as venezuelan extra - heavy and mexican heavy oil in chemical composition , and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery . many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non - upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline , diesel fuel , and refined asphalt without any preprocessing . this is particularly common in areas such as the us gulf coast , where refineries were designed to process venezuelan and mexican oil , and in areas such as the us midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined . given the choice , such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower , and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline . by 2015 canadian production and exports of non - upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over 1 moilbbl per day , of which about 65 was exported to the united states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines , non - upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with natural - gas condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil , called synbit . however , to meet international competition , much non - upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen , conventional crude oil , synthetic crude oil , and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as western canadian select . this sour , heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as mexican mayan or arabian dubai crude . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asphalt was used starting in the 1960s as a hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium - activity salts ( mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate ) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds . bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha - emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in france , belgium and japan , but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues ( risks of fire , as occurred in a bituminisation plant at tokai works in japan ) and long - term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations . one of the main problems is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water . asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis . a second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve . the high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix . the water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts , the asphalt acting as a semi - permeable membrane . this also causes the matrix to swell . the swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar . if not properly managed , this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium - level waste . when the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling , encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere . the high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks . the presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions , preventing the reduction of redox - sensitive radionuclides . under their higher valences , radionuclides of elements such as selenium , technetium , uranium , neptunium and plutonium have a higher solubility and are also often present in water as non - retarded anions . this makes the disposal of medium - level bituminised waste very challenging . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break different types of asphalt have been used : blown bitumen ( partly oxidized with air oxygen at high temperature after distillation , and harder ) and direct distillation bitumen ( softer ) . blown bitumens like mexphalte , with a high content of saturated hydrocarbons , are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen , with a low content of saturated hydrocarbons and a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break concrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered a safer alternative by the nuclear industry and the waste management organisations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break roofing shingles and roll roofing account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption . other uses include cattle sprays , fence - post treatments , and waterproofing for fabrics . asphalt is used to make japan black , a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel , and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink , and to make the color darker . asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break about 40000000 tons were produced in 1984 . it is obtained as the " heavy " ( that is , difficult to distill ) fraction . material with a boiling point greater than around 500°c is considered asphalt . vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil ( such as naphtha , gasoline and diesel ) . the resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications . in a de - asphalting unit , the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical phase to extract the lighter molecules , which are then separated . further processing is possible by " blowing " the product : namely reacting it with oxygen . this step makes the product harder and more viscous . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around 150 °c . sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity ; upon delivery , these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture . this mixture is often called " bitumen feedstock " , or bfs . some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm . the backs of tippers carrying asphalt , as well as some handling equipment , are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release . diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from " oil sands " , currently under development in alberta , canada . canada has most of the worlds supply of natural bitumen , covering 140000 square kilometres ( an area larger than england ) , giving it the second - largest proven oil reserves in the world . the athabasca oil sands are the largest bitumen deposit in canada and the only one accessible to surface mining , although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by in situ methods . because of oil price increases after 2003 , producing bitumen became highly profitable , but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again . by 2014 , canadian crude bitumen production averaged about 2 moilbbl per day and was projected to rise to 4 moilbbl per day by 2020 . the total amount of crude bitumen in alberta that could be extracted is estimated to be about 310 goilbbl , which at a rate of 4400000 oilbbl / d would last about 200 years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although uncompetitive economically , asphalt can be made from nonpetroleum - based renewable resources such as sugar , molasses and rice , corn and potato starches . asphalt can also be made from waste material by fractional distillation of used motor oil , which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills . use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates , resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nonpetroleum - based asphalt binders can be made light - colored . lighter - colored roads absorb less heat from solar radiation , reducing their contribution to the urban heat island effect . parking lots that use asphalt alternatives are called green parking lots . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in native deposits in selenice , in albania , the only european asphalt mine still in use . the bitumen is found in the form of veins , filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction . the bitumen content varies from 83 to 92 ( soluble in carbon disulphide ) , with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point ( ring and ball ) around 120°c . the insoluble matter , consisting mainly of silica ore , ranges from 8 to 17 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the romans . after centuries of silence , the first mentions of albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868 , when the frenchman coquand published the first geological description of the deposits of albanian bitumen . in 1875 , the exploitation rights were granted to the ottoman government and in 1912 , they were transferred to the italian company simsa . since 1945 , the mine was exploited by the albanian government and from 2001 to date , the management passed to a french company , which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break today the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines ( deep and extending over several km ) still remain viable . selenizza is produced primarily in granular form , after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector . it is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing . it may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks , but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants . other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks , bridges , car - parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry . selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a life - cycle assessment study of the natural selenizza compared with petroleum asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza is about half the impact of the road asphalt produced in oil refineries in terms of carbon dioxide emission . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asphalt is a commonly recycled material in the construction industry . the two most common recycled materials that contain asphalt are reclaimed asphalt pavement ( rap ) and reclaimed asphalt shingles ( ras ) . rap is recycled at a greater rate than any other material in the united states , and typically contains approximately 5 – 6 asphalt binder . asphalt shingles typically contain 20 – 40 asphalt binder . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asphalt naturally becomes stiffer over time due to oxidation , evaporation , exudation , and physical hardening . for this reason , recycled asphalt is typically combined with virgin asphalt , softening agents , and / or rejuvenating additives to restore its physical and chemical properties . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for information on the processing and performance of rap and ras , see asphalt concrete . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for information on the different types of ras and associated health and safety concerns , see asphalt shingles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for information on in - place recycling methods used to restore pavements and roadways , see road surface . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although asphalt typically makes up only 4 to 5 percent ( by weight ) of the pavement mixture , as the pavements binder , it is also the most expensive part of the cost of the road - paving material . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during asphalts early use in modern paving , oil refiners gave it away . however , asphalt is a highly traded commodity today . its prices increased substantially in the early 21st century . a government report states : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the report indicates that an " average " 1 - mile ( 1 - kilometer ) - long , four - lane highway would include " 300 tons of asphalt , " which , " in 2002 would have cost around 48000 . by 2006 this would have increased to 96000 and by 2012 to 183000 an increase of about 135000 for every mile of highway in just 10 years .

the american national standards institute ( ansi ) is a private non - profit organization that oversees the development of voluntary consensus standards for products , services , processes , systems , and personnel in the united states . the organization also coordinates standards with international standards so that american products can be used worldwide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ansi accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other standards organizations , government agencies , consumer groups , companies , and others . these standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent , that people use the same definitions and terms , and that products are tested the same way . ansi also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the organizations headquarters are in washington , ansis operations office is located in new york city . the ansi annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications , membership dues and fees , accreditation services , fee - based programs , and international standards programs uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ansi was most likely originally formed in 1918 , when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the american engineering standards committee ( aesc ) . in 1928 , the aesc became the american standards association ( asa ) . in 1966 , the asa was reorganized and became united states of america standards institute ( usasi ) . the present name was adopted in 1969 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break prior to 1918 , these five founding engineering societies : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break had been members of the united engineering society ( ues ) . at the behest of the aiee , they invited the government departments of war , navy ( combined in 1947 to become the department of defense or dod ) and commerce to join in founding a national standards organization . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to adam stanton , the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919 , aesc started as an ambitious program and little else . staff for the first year consisted of one executive , clifford lepage , who was on loan from a founding member , asme . an annual budget of 7500 was provided by the founding bodies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1931 , the organization ( renamed asa in 1928 ) became affiliated with the national committee of the international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) , which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ansis members are government agencies , organizations , academic and international bodies , and individuals . in total , the institute represents the interests of more than 270000 companies and organizations and 30 million professionals worldwide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although ansi itself does not develop standards , the institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations . ansi accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the institutes requirements for openness , balance , consensus , and due process . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ansi also designates specific standards as american national standards , or ans , when the institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable , accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers . there are approximately 9500 american national standards that carry the ansi designation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the american national standards process involves : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the united states , ansi promotes the use of standards internationally , advocates policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations , and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the institute is the official representative to the two major international standards organizations , the international organization for standardization ( iso ) , as a founding member , and the international electrotechnical commission ( iec ) , via the national committee ( usnc ) . ansi participates in almost the entire technical program of both the iso and the iec , and administers many key committees and subgroups . in many instances , standards are taken forward to iso and iec , through ansi or the usnc , where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break adoption of iso and iec standards as american standards increased from 0 in 1986 to 15 in may 2012 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the institute administers nine standards panels : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break each of the panels works to identify , coordinate , and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2009 , ansi and the national institute of standards and technology ( nist ) formed the nuclear energy standards coordination collaborative ( nescc ) . nescc is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

*********** Article 57: Apollo 11 ***********

apollo 11 ( july 16–24 , 1969 ) was the american spaceflight that first landed humans on the moon . commander neil armstrong and lunar module pilot buzz aldrin landed the apollo lunar module eagle on july 20 , 1969 , at 20 : 17 utc , and armstrong became the first person to step onto the moons surface six hours and 39 minutes later , on july 21 at 02 : 56 utc . aldrin joined him 19 minutes later , and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named tranquility base upon landing . armstrong and aldrin collected 47 lb of lunar material to bring back to earth as pilot michael collins flew the command module columbia in lunar orbit , and were on the moons surface for 21 hours , 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin columbia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 11 was launched by a saturn v rocket from kennedy space center on merritt island , florida , on july 16 at 13 : 32 utc , and it was the fifth crewed mission of nasas apollo program . the apollo spacecraft had three parts : a command module ( cm ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , the only part that returned to earth ; a service module ( sm ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( lm ) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after being sent to the moon by the saturn vs third stage , the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit . armstrong and aldrin then moved into eagle and landed in the sea of tranquility on july 20 . the astronauts used eagles ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin collins in the command module . they jettisoned eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled columbia out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to earth . they returned to earth and splashed down in the pacific ocean on july 24 after more than eight days in space . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break armstrongs first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live tv to a worldwide audience . he described the event as " one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the late 1950s and early 1960s , the united states was engaged in the cold war , a geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union . on october 4 , 1957 , the soviet union launched sputnik 1 , the first artificial satellite . this surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world . it demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances , and challenged american claims of military , economic and technological superiority . this precipitated the sputnik crisis , and triggered the space race to prove which superpower would achieve superior spaceflight capability . president dwight eisenhower responded to the sputnik challenge by creating the national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) , and initiating project mercury , which aimed to launch a man into earth orbit . but on april 12 , 1961 , soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person in space , and the first to orbit the earth . nearly a month later , on may 5 , 1961 , alan shepard became the first american in space , completing a 15 - minute suborbital journey . after being recovered from the atlantic ocean , he received a congratulatory telephone call from eisenhowers successor , john kennedy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since the soviet union had higher lift capacity launch vehicles , kennedy chose , from among options presented by nasa , a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry , so that the us and soviet union would be starting from a position of equality . a crewed mission to the moon would serve this purpose . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on may 25 , 1961 , kennedy addressed the united states congress on " urgent national needs " and declared : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on september 12 , 1962 , kennedy delivered another speech before a crowd of about 40000 people in the rice university football stadium in houston , texas . a widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break we choose to go to the moon ! we choose to go to the moon uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in spite of that , the proposed program faced the opposition of many americans and was dubbed a " moondoggle " by norbert wiener , a mathematician at the massachusetts institute of technology . the effort to land a man on the moon already had a name : project apollo . when kennedy met with nikita khrushchev , the premier of the soviet union in june 1961 , he proposed making the moon landing a joint project , but khrushchev did not take up the offer . kennedy again proposed a joint expedition to the moon in a speech to the united nations general assembly on september 20 , 1963 . the idea of a joint moon mission was abandoned after kennedys death . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and earth orbit rendezvous . a space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up . in july 1962 nasa head james webb announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used and that the apollo spacecraft would have three major parts : a command module ( cm ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that returned to earth ; a service module ( sm ) , which supported the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a lunar module ( lm ) that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the moon , and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit . this design meant the spacecraft could be launched by a single saturn v rocket that was then under development . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break technologies and techniques required for apollo were developed by project gemini . the apollo project was enabled by nasas adoption of new advances in semiconductor electronic technology , including metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) in the interplanetary monitoring platform ( imp ) and silicon integrated circuit ( ic ) chips in the apollo guidance computer ( agc ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break project apollo was abruptly halted by the apollo 1 fire on january 27 , 1967 , in which astronauts gus grissom , ed white , and roger chaffee died , and the subsequent investigation . in october 1968 , apollo 7 evaluated the command module in earth orbit , and in december apollo 8 tested it in lunar orbit . in march 1969 , apollo 9 put the lunar module through its paces in earth orbit , and in may apollo 10 conducted a " dress rehearsal " in lunar orbit . by july 1969 , all was in readiness for apollo 11 to take the final step onto the moon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the soviet union appeared to be winning the space race by beating the us to firsts , but its early lead was overtaken by the us gemini program and soviet failure to develop the n1 launcher , which would have been comparable to the saturn the soviets tried to beat the us to return lunar material to the earth by means of uncrewed probes . on july 13 , three days before apollo 11 ' s launch , the soviet union launched luna 15 , which reached lunar orbit before apollo 11 . during descent , a malfunction caused luna 15 to crash in mare crisium about two hours before armstrong and aldrin took off from the moons surface to begin their voyage home . the nuffield radio astronomy laboratories radio telescope in england recorded transmissions from luna 15 during its descent , and these were released in july 2009 for the 40th anniversary of apollo 11 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the initial crew assignment of commander neil armstrong , command module pilot ( cmp ) jim lovell , and lunar module pilot ( lmp ) buzz aldrin on the backup crew for apollo9 was officially announced on november 20 , 1967 . lovell and aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of gemini 12 . due to design and manufacturing delays in the lm , apollo8 and apollo9 swapped prime and backup crews , and armstrongs crew became the backup for apollo8 . based on the normal crew rotation scheme , armstrong was then expected to command apollo 11 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there would be one change . michael collins , the cmp on the apollo8 crew , began experiencing trouble with his legs . doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae , requiring surgery . lovell took his place on the apollo8 crew , and when collins recovered he joined armstrongs crew as cmp . in the meantime , fred haise filled in as backup lmp , and aldrin as backup cmp for apollo 8 . apollo 11 was the second american mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience , the first being apollo 10 . the next was sts - 26 in 1988 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break deke slayton gave armstrong the option to replace aldrin with lovell , since some thought aldrin was difficult to work with . armstrong had no issues working with aldrin but thought it over for a day before declining . he thought lovell deserved to command his own mission ( eventually apollo 13 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the apollo 11 prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of apollo 12 . instead , they forged an amiable working relationship . armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof , but collins , who considered himself a loner , confessed to rebuffing aldrins attempts to create a more personal relationship . aldrin and collins described the crew as " amiable strangers " . armstrong did not agree with the assessment , and said " all the crews i was on worked very well together . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the backup crew consisted of lovell as commander , william anders as cmp , and haise as lmp . anders had flown with lovell on apollo8 . in early 1969 , he accepted a job with the national aeronautics and space council effective august 1969 , and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time . ken mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with anders as backup cmp in case apollo 11 was delayed past its intended july launch date , at which point anders would be unavailable . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by the normal crew rotation in place during apollo , lovell , mattingly , and haise were scheduled to fly on apollo 14 after backing up for apollo 11 . later , lovells crew was forced to switch places with alan shepards tentative apollo 13 crew to give shepard more training time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during projects mercury and gemini , each mission had a prime and a backup crew . for apollo , a third crew of astronauts was added , known as the support crew . the support crew maintained the flight plan , checklists and mission ground rules , and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes . they developed procedures , especially those for emergency situations , so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators , allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them . for apollo 11 , the support crew consisted of ken mattingly , ronald evans and bill pogue . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the capsule communicator ( capcom ) was an astronaut at the mission control center in houston , texas , who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew . for apollo 11 , the capcoms were : charles duke , ronald evans , bruce mccandless ii , james lovell , william anders , ken mattingly , fred haise , don lind , owen garriott and harrison schmitt . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the flight directors for this mission were : lt ; ! - uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sources are inconsistent . resolved at talk : apollo 11semi - protected edit request on 8 june 2019 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other key personnel who played important roles in the apollo 11 mission include the following . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by collins , who wanted a symbol for " peaceful lunar landing by the united states " . at lovells suggestion , he chose the bald eagle , the national bird of the united states , as the symbol . tom wilson , a simulator instructor , suggested an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful mission . collins added a lunar background with the earth in the distance . the sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong direction ; the shadow should have been in the lower part of the earth instead of the left . aldrin , armstrong and collins decided the eagle and the moon would be in their natural colors , and decided on a blue and gold border . armstrong was concerned that " eleven " would not be understood by non - english speakers , so they went with " apollo 11 " , and they decided not to put their names on the patch , so it would " be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an illustrator at the manned spacecraft center ( msc ) did the artwork , which was then sent off to nasa officials for approval . the design was rejected . bob gilruth , the director of the msc felt the talons of the eagle looked " too warlike " . after some discussion , the olive branch was moved to the talons . when the eisenhower dollar coin was released in 1971 , the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side . the design was also used for the smaller susan anthony dollar unveiled in 1979 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the crew of apollo 10 named their spacecraft charlie brown and snoopy , assistant manager for public affairs julian scheer wrote to george low , the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office at the msc , to suggest the apollo 11 crew be less flippant in naming their craft . the name snowcone was used for the cm and haystack was used for the lm in both internal and external communications during early mission planning . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the lm was named eagle after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia . at scheers suggestion , the cm was named columbia after columbiad , the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft ( also from florida ) in jules vernes 1865 novel from the earth to the moon . it also referred to columbia , a historical name of the united states . in collins ' 1976 book , he said columbia was in reference to christopher columbus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the astronauts had personal preference kits ( ppks ) , small bags containing personal items of significance they wanted to take with them on the mission . five 0 lb ppks were carried on apollo 11 : three ( one for each astronaut ) were stowed on columbia before launch , and two on eagle . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break neil armstrongs lm ppk contained a piece of wood from the wright brothers ' 1903 wright flyers left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing , along with a diamond - studded astronaut pin originally given to slayton by the widows of the apollo1 crew . this pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to slayton afterwards , but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals , the widows gave the pin to slayton . armstrong took it with him on apollo 11 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nasas apollo site selection board announced five potential landing sites on february 8 , 1968 . these were the result of two years ' worth of studies based on high - resolution photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the lunar orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the surveyor program . the best earth - bound telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution project apollo required . the landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required , clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering , and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar . scientific value was not a consideration . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on earth were often found to be totally unacceptable . the original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed , as no such site was found . five sites were considered : sites1 and2 were in the sea of tranquility ( mare tranquillitatis ) ; site3 was in the central bay ( sinus medii ) ; and sites4 and5 were in the ocean of storms ( oceanus procellarum ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the final site selection was based on seven criteria : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the requirement for the sun angle was particularly restrictive , limiting the launch date to one day per month . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the first press conference after the apollo 11 crew was announced , the first question was , " which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar surface ? " slayton told the reporter it had not been decided , and armstrong added that it was " not based on individual desire " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander , which matched what had been done on gemini missions , where the commander had never performed the spacewalk . reporters wrote in early 1969 that aldrin would be the first man to walk on the moon , and associate administrator george mueller told reporters he would be first as well . aldrin heard that armstrong would be the first because armstrong was a civilian , which made aldrin livid . aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first , but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign . attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict , slayton told aldrin that armstrong would be first since he was the commander . the decision was announced in a press conference on april 14 , 1969 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for decades , aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar modules hatch location . because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small , maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult . the crew tried a simulation in which aldrin left the spacecraft first , but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress . while this was enough for mission planners to make their decision , aldrin and armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring . slayton told armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first , if he agreed . armstrong said , " yes , thats the way to do it . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the media accused armstrong of exercising his commanders prerogative to exit the spacecraft first . chris kraft revealed in his 2001 autobiography that a meeting occurred between gilruth , slayton , low , and himself to make sure aldrin would not be the first to walk on the moon . they argued that the first person to walk on the moon should be like charles lindbergh , a calm and quiet person . they made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ascent stage of lm - 5 eagle arrived at the kennedy space center on january 8 , 1969 , followed by the descent stage four days later , and csm - 107 columbia on january 23 . there were several differences between eagle and apollo 10 ' s lm - 4 snoopy ; eagle had a vhf radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their eva on the lunar surface ; a lighter ascent engine ; more thermal protection on the landing gear ; and a package of scientific experiments known as the early apollo scientific experiments package ( easep ) . the only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward hatch . the csm was mated on january 29 , and moved from the operations and checkout building to the vehicle assembly building on april 14 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the s - ivb third stage of saturn v as - 506 had arrived on january 18 , followed by the s - ii second stage on february 6 , s - ic first stage on february 20 , and the saturn v instrument unit on february 27 . at 12 : 30 on may 20 , the 5443 t assembly departed the vehicle assembly building atop the crawler - transporter , bound for launch pad 39a , part of launch complex 39 , while apollo 10 was still on its way to the moon . a countdown test commenced on june 26 , and concluded on july 2 . the launch complex was floodlit on the night of july 15 , when the crawler - transporter carried the mobile service structure back to its parking area . in the early hours of the morning , the fuel tanks of the s - ii and s - ivb stages were filled with liquid hydrogen . fueling was completed by three hours before launch . launch operations were partly automated , with 43 programs written in the atoll programming language . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break slayton roused the crew shortly after 04 : 00 , and they showered , shaved , and had the traditional pre - flight breakfast of steak and eggs with slayton and the backup crew . they then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen . at 06 : 30 , they headed out to launch complex 39 . haise entered columbia about three hours and ten minutes before launch time . along with a technician , he helped armstrong into the left - hand couch at 06 : 54 . five minutes later , collins joined him , taking up his position on the right - hand couch . finally , aldrin entered , taking the center couch . haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch . the closeout crew sealed the hatch , and the cabin was purged and pressurized . the closeout crew then left the launch complex about an hour before launch time . the countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time . over 450 personnel were at the consoles in the firing room . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of apollo 11 from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site . dignitaries included the chief of staff of the united states army , general william westmoreland , four cabinet members , 19 state governors , 40 mayors , 60 ambassadors and 200 congressmen . vice president spiro agnew viewed the launch with former president lyndon johnson and his wife lady bird johnson . around 3500 media representatives were present . about two - thirds were from the united states ; the rest came from 55 other countries . the launch was televised live in 33 countries , with an estimated 25million viewers in the united states alone . millions more around the world listened to radio broadcasts . president richard nixon viewed the launch from his office in the white house with his nasa liaison officer , apollo astronaut frank borman . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break saturn v as - 506 launched apollo 11 on july 16 , 1969 , at 13 : 32 : 00 utc ( 9 : 32 : 00 edt ) . at 13 seconds into the flight , the launch vehicle began to roll into its flight azimuth of 72° . full shutdown of the first - stage engines occurred about 2minutes and 42 seconds into the mission , followed by separation of the s - ic and ignition of the s - ii engines . the second stage engines then cut off and separated at about 9minutes and 8seconds , allowing the first ignition of the s - ivb engine a few seconds later . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 11 entered a near - circular earth orbit at an altitude of 100 nmi by 98 nmi , twelve minutes into its flight . after one and a half orbits , a second ignition of the s - ivb engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the moon with the trans - lunar injection ( tli ) burn at 16 : 22 : 13 utc . about 30 minutes later , with collins in the left seat and at the controls , the transposition , docking , and extraction maneuver was performed . this involved separating columbia from the spent s - ivb stage , turning around , and docking with eagle still attached to the stage . after the lm was extracted , the combined spacecraft headed for the moon , while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the moon . this was done to avoid the third stage colliding with the spacecraft , the earth , or the moon . a slingshot effect from passing around the moon threw it into an orbit around the sun . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on july 19 at 17 : 21 : 50 utc , apollo 11 passed behind the moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit . in the thirty orbits that followed , the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern sea of tranquility about 12 mi southwest of the crater sabine the site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated ranger 8 and surveyor 5 landers and the lunar orbiter mapping spacecraft , and because it was unlikely to present major landing or eva challenges . it lay about 25 km southeast of the surveyor5 landing site , and 68 km southwest of ranger8 ' s crash site . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at 12 : 52 : 00 utc on july 20 , aldrin and armstrong entered eagle , and began the final preparations for lunar descent . at 17 : 44 : 00 eagle separated from columbia . collins , alone aboard columbia , inspected eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged , and that the landing gear was correctly deployed . armstrong exclaimed : " the eagle has wings ! " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as the descent began , armstrong and aldrin found themselves passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early , and reported that they were " long " ; they would land miles west of their target point . eagle was traveling too fast . the problem could have been mascons—concentrations of high mass in a region or regions of the moons crust that contains a gravitational anomaly , potentially altering eagle trajectory . flight director gene kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel . or it could have been the result of eagles pirouette maneuver . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break five minutes into the descent burn , and 6000 ft above the surface of the moon , the lm guidance computer ( lgc ) distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected 1201 and 1202 program alarms inside mission control center , computer engineer jack garman told guidance officer steve bales it was safe to continue the descent , and this was relayed to the crew . the program alarms indicated " executive overflows " , meaning the guidance computer could not complete all its tasks in real - time and had to postpone some of them . margaret hamilton , the director of apollo flight computer programming at the mit charles stark draper laboratory later recalled : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the mission , the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position , causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time . software engineer don eyles concluded in a 2005 guidance and control conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first uncrewed lm in apollo 5 . having the rendezvous radar on ( so it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort ) should have been irrelevant to the computer , but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions , depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up . the extra spurious cycle stealing , as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter , caused the computer alarms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when armstrong again looked outside , he saw that the computers landing target was in a boulder - strewn area just north and east of a 300 ft crater ( later determined to be west crater ) , so he took semi - automatic control . armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it , but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high . throughout the descent , aldrin called out navigation data to armstrong , who was busy piloting eagle . now 107 ft above the surface , armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it . as he got closer , now 250 ft above the surface , he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it . he cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground . they were now 100 ft from the surface , with only 90 seconds of propellant remaining . lunar dust kicked up by the lms engine began to impair his ability to determine the spacecrafts motion . some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud , and armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecrafts speed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a light informed aldrin that at least one of the 67 in probes hanging from eagle footpads had touched the surface a few moments before the landing and he said : " contact light ! " armstrong was supposed to immediately shut the engine down , as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engines own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode , but he forgot . three seconds later , eagle landed and armstrong shut the engine down . aldrin immediately said " okay , engine stop . aca—out of detent . " armstrong acknowledged : " out of detent . aldrin continued : " mode control—both auto . descent engine command override off . 413 is in . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aca was the attitude control assembly—the lms control stick . output went to the lgc to command the reaction control system ( rcs ) jets to fire . " out of detent " meant the stick had moved away from its centered position ; it was spring - centered like the turn indicator in a car . lgc address 413 contained the variable that indicated the lm had landed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break eagle landed at 20 : 17 : 40 utc on sunday july 20 with 216 lb of usable fuel remaining . information available to the crew and mission controllers during the landing showed the lm had enough fuel for another 25 seconds of powered flight before an abort without touchdown would have become unsafe , apollo 11 landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions , and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning . this was later found to be the result of the propellant sloshing more than expected , uncovering a fuel sensor . on subsequent missions , extra anti - slosh baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break armstrong acknowledged aldrins completion of the post - landing checklist with " engine arm is off " , before responding to the capcom , charles duke , with the words , " houston , tranquility base here . the eagle has landed . " armstrongs unrehearsed change of call sign from " eagle " to " tranquility base " emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful . duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at mission control : " roger , twan—tranquility , we copy you on the ground . you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue . were breathing again . thanks a lot . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break two and a half hours after landing , before preparations began for the eva , aldrin radioed to earth : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he then took communion privately . at this time nasa was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist madalyn murray ohair ( who had objected to the apollo8 crew reading from the book of genesis ) demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space . for this reason , aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the moon . aldrin was an elder at the webster presbyterian church , and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church , dean woodruff . webster presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the moon and commemorates the event each year on the sunday closest to july 20 . the schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a five - hour sleep period , but they chose to begin preparations for the eva early , thinking they would be unable to sleep . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break preparations for neil armstrong and buzz aldrin to walk on the moon began at 23 : 43 . these took longer than expected ; three and a half hours instead of two . during training on earth , everything required had been neatly laid out in advance , but on the moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well , such as checklists , food packets , and tools . six hours and thirty - nine minutes after landing armstrong and aldrin were ready to go outside , and eagle was depressurized . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break eagles hatch was opened at 02 : 39 : 33 . armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his portable life support system ( plss ) . some of the highest heart rates recorded from apollo astronauts occurred during lm egress and ingress . at 02 : 51 armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface . the remote control unit on his chest kept him from seeing his feet . climbing down the nine - rung ladder , armstrong pulled a d - ring to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly ( mesa ) folded against eagle side and activate the tv camera . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 11 used slow - scan television ( tv ) incompatible with broadcast tv , so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional tv camera viewed this monitor ( thus , a broadcast of a broadcast ) , significantly reducing the quality of the picture . the signal was received at goldstone in the united states , but with better fidelity by honeysuckle creek tracking station near canberra in australia . minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive parkes radio telescope in australia . despite some technical and weather difficulties , ghostly black and white images of the first lunar eva were received and broadcast to at least 600million people on earth . copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available , but recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape re - use at nasa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after describing the surface dust as " very fine - grained " and " almost like a powder " , six and a half hours after landing , armstrong stepped off eagle footpad and declared : " thats one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break armstrong intended to say " thats one small step for a man " , but the word " a " is not audible in the transmission , and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast . when later asked about his quote , armstrong said he believed he said " for a man " , and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the " a " in square brackets . one explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words " for a " together ; another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to earth , partly because of storms near parkes observatory . a more recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the " a " may have been spoken but obscured by static . other analysis points to the claims of static and slurring as " face - saving fabrication " , and that armstrong himself later admitted to misspeaking the line . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break about seven minutes after stepping onto the moons surface , armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick . he then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh . this was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the eva and return to the lm . twelve minutes after the sample was collected , he removed the tv camera from the mesa and made a panoramic sweep , then mounted it on a tripod . the tv camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the eva . still photography was accomplished with a hasselblad camera that could be operated hand held or mounted on armstrongs apollo space suit . aldrin joined armstrong on the surface . he described the view with the simple phrase : " magnificent desolation . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break armstrong said moving in the lunar gravity , one - sixth of earths , was " even perhaps easier than the simulations its absolutely no trouble to walk around . " aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around , including two - footed kangaroo hops . the plss backpack created a tendency to tip backward , but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance . loping became the preferred method of movement . the astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead . the fine soil was quite slippery . aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into eagle shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit , but the helmet was warmer in sunlight , so he felt cooler in shadow . the mesa failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow , slowing work somewhat . as they worked , the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust , which soiled the outer part of their suits . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the astronauts planted the lunar flag assembly containing a flag of the united states on the lunar surface , in clear view of the tv camera . aldrin remembered , " of all the jobs i had to do on the moon the one i wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising . " but the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole about into the hard lunar surface . aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of tv viewers . but he gave " a crisp west point salute " . nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call , but frank borman , who was at the white house as a nasa liaison during apollo 11 , convinced nixon to keep his words brief . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break armstrong : thank you , mr . president . its a great honor and privilege for us to be here , representing not only the united states , but men of peace of all nations , and with interest and a curiosity , and men with a vision for the future . its an honor for us to be able to participate here today . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break they deployed the easep , which included a passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes and a retroreflector array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment . three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts : armalcolite , tranquillityite , and pyroxferroite . armalcolite was named after armstrong , aldrin , and collins . all have subsequently been found on earth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while on the surface , armstrong uncovered a plaque mounted on the lm ladder , bearing two drawings of earth ( of the western and eastern hemispheres ) , an inscription , and signatures of the astronauts and president nixon . the inscription read : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the behest of the nixon administration to add a reference to god , nasa included the vague date as a reason to include , which stands for anno domini , " in the year of our lord " ( although it should have been placed before the year , not after ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mission control used a coded phrase to warn armstrong his metabolic rates were high , and that he should slow down . he was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out . as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk , mission control granted the astronauts a 15 - minute extension . in a 2010 interview , armstrong explained that nasa limited the first moonwalks time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts ' plss backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the moon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aldrin entered eagle first . with some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing 21 kg of lunar surface material to the lm hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the lunar equipment conveyor ( lec ) . this proved to be an inefficient tool , and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the lm by hand . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break presidential speech writer william safire had prepared an in event of moon disaster announcement for nixon to read in the event the apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the moon . the remarks were in a memo from safire to nixons white house chief of staff haldeman , in which safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster . according to the plan , mission control would " close down communications " with the lm , and a clergyman would " commend their souls to the deepest of the deep " in a public ritual likened to burial at sea . the last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to rupert brookes first world war poem , " the soldier " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while moving inside the cabin , aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for liftoff from the moon . there was a concern this would prevent firing the engine , stranding them on the moon . a felt - tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after more than hours on the lunar surface , in addition to the scientific instruments , the astronauts left behind : an apollo 1 mission patch in memory of astronautsroger chaffee , gus grissom , and edward white , who died when their command module caught fire during a test in january 1967 ; two memorial medals of soviet cosmonauts vladimir komarov and yuri gagarin , who died in 1967 and 1968 respectively ; a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace ; and a silicon message disk carrying the goodwill statements by presidents eisenhower , kennedy , johnson , and nixon along with messages from leaders of 73 countries around the world . the disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the us congress , a listing of members of the four committees of the house and senate responsible for the nasa legislation , and the names of nasas past and then - current top management . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after about seven hours of rest , the crew was awakened by houston to prepare for the return flight . two and a half hours later , at 17 : 54 : 00 utc , they lifted off in eagle ascent stage to rejoin collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit . film taken from the lm ascent stage upon liftoff from the moon reveals the american flag , planted some from the descent stage , whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine . aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple : " the ascent stage of the lm separated i was concentrating on the computers , and neil was studying the attitude indicator , but i looked up long enough to see the flag fall over . " subsequent apollo missions planted their flags farther from the lm . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during his day flying solo around the moon , collins never felt lonely . although it has been said " not since adam has any human known such solitude " , collins felt very much a part of the mission . in his autobiography he wrote : " this venture has been structured for three men , and i consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two " . in the 48 minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the earth while columbia passed round the far side of the moon , the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness , but rather " awareness , anticipation , satisfaction , confidence , almost exultation " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one of collins ' first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground . to give collins an idea where to look , mission control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about 4 mile off target . each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site , he tried in vain to find the module . on his first orbits on the back side of the moon , collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and preparing the cabin for armstrong and aldrin to return . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit , mission control informed collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant . if it became too cold , parts of columbia might freeze . mission control advised him to assume manual control and implement environmental control system malfunction procedure 17 . instead , collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again , and carried on with normal housekeeping chores , while keeping an eye on the temperature . when columbia came back around to the near side of the moon again , he was able to report that the problem had been resolved . for the next couple of orbits , he described his time on the back side of the moon as " relaxing " . after aldrin and armstrong completed their eva , collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous . while the flight plan called for eagle to meet up with columbia , collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly columbia down to meet eagle . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break eagle rendezvoused with columbia at 21 : 24 utc on july 21 , and the two docked at 21 : 35 . eagles ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at 23 : 41 . just before the apollo 12 flight , it was noted that eagle was still likely to be orbiting the moon . later nasa reports mentioned that eagle orbit had decayed , resulting in it impacting in an " uncertain location " on the lunar surface . in 2021 , however , some calculations show that the lander may still be in orbit . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on july 23 , the last night before splashdown , the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which collins commented : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aldrin added : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break armstrong concluded : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on the return to earth , a bearing at the guam tracking station failed , potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the earth return . a regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director , charles force , had his ten - year - old son greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease . greg was later thanked by armstrong . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aircraft carrier , under the command of captain carl seiberlich , was selected as the primary recovery ship ( prs ) for apollo 11 on june 5 , replacing its sister ship , the lph , which had recovered apollo 10 on may 26 . hornet was then at her home port of long beach , california . on reaching pearl harbor on july 5 , hornet embarked the sikorsky sh - 3 sea king helicopters of hs - 4 , a unit which specialized in recovery of apollo spacecraft , specialized divers of udt detachment apollo , a 35 - man nasa recovery team , and about 120 media representatives . to make room , most of hornets air wing was left behind in long beach . special recovery equipment was also loaded , including a boilerplate command module used for training . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on july 12 , with apollo 11 still on the launch pad , hornet departed pearl harbor for the recovery area in the central pacific , in the vicinity of . a presidential party consisting of nixon , borman , secretary of state william rogers and national security advisor henry kissinger flew to johnston atoll on air force one , then to the command ship uss arlington in marine one . after a night on board , they would fly to hornet in marine one for a few hours of ceremonies . on arrival aboard hornet , the party was greeted by the commander - in - chief , pacific command ( cincpac ) , admiral john mccain jr . and nasa administrator thomas paine , who flew to hornet from pago pago in one of hornets carrier onboard delivery aircraft . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break weather satellites were not yet common , but us air force captain hank brandli had access to top - secret spy satellite images . he realized that a storm front was headed for the apollo recovery area . poor visibility which could make locating the capsule difficult , and strong upper - level winds which " would have ripped their parachutes to shreds " according to brandli , posed a serious threat to the safety of the mission . brandli alerted navy captain willard houston jr . the commander of the fleet weather center at pearl harbor , who had the required security clearance . on their recommendation , rear admiral donald davis , commander of manned spaceflight recovery forces , pacific , advised nasa to change the recovery area , each man risking his career . a new location was selected 215 nmi northeast . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this altered the flight plan . a different sequence of computer programs was used , one never before attempted . in a conventional entry , trajectory event p64 was followed by p67 . for a skip - out re - entry , p65 and p66 were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip . in this case , because they were extending the re - entry but not actually skipping out , p66 was not invoked and instead , p65 led directly to p67 . the crew were also warned they would not be in a full - lift ( heads - down ) attitude when they entered p67 . the first programs acceleration subjected the astronauts to 6 g0 ; the second , to 6 g0 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before dawn on july 24 , hornet launched four sea king helicopters and three grumman e - 1 tracers . two of the e - 1s were designated as " air boss " while the third acted as a communications relay aircraft . two of the sea kings carried divers and recovery equipment . the third carried photographic equipment , and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon . at 16 : 44 utc ( 05 : 44 local time ) columbias drogue parachutes were deployed . this was observed by the helicopters . seven minutes later columbia struck the water forcefully 2660 km east of wake island , 380 km south of johnston atoll , and 24 km from hornet , reconnaissance aircraft flying to the original splashdown location reported the conditions brandli and houston had predicted . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during splashdown , columbia landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation bags activated by the astronauts . a diver from the navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to prevent it from drifting . more divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for astronaut extraction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the divers then passed biological isolation garments ( bigs ) to the astronauts , and assisted them into the life raft . the possibility of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote , but nasa took precautions at the recovery site . the astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and columbia wiped with povidone - iodine to remove any lunar dust that might be present . the astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter . bigs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board hornet . the raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after touchdown on hornet at 17 : 53 utc , the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay , where the astronauts walked the 30 ft to the mobile quarantine facility ( mqf ) , where they would begin the earth - based portion of their 21 days of quarantine . this practice would continue for two more apollo missions , apollo 12 and apollo 14 , before the moon was proven to be barren of life , and the quarantine process dropped . nixon welcomed the astronauts back to earth . he told them : " as a result of what youve done , the world has never been closer together before . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after nixon departed , hornet was brought alongside the 5 st columbia , which was lifted aboard by the ships crane , placed on a dolly and moved next to the mqf . it was then attached to the mqf with a flexible tunnel , allowing the lunar samples , film , data tapes and other items to be removed . hornet returned to pearl harbor , where the mqf was loaded onto a lockheed c - 141 starlifter and airlifted to the manned spacecraft center . the astronauts arrived at the lunar receiving laboratory at 10 : 00 utc on july 28 . columbia was taken to ford island for deactivation , and its pyrotechnics made safe . it was then taken to hickham air force base , from whence it was flown to houston in a douglas c - 133 cargomaster , reaching the lunar receiving laboratory on july 30 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in accordance with the extra - terrestrial exposure law , a set of regulations promulgated by nasa on july 16 to codify its quarantine protocol , the astronauts continued in quarantine . after three weeks in confinement ( first in the apollo spacecraft , then in their trailer on hornet , and finally in the lunar receiving laboratory ) , the astronauts were given a clean bill of health . on august 10 , 1969 , the interagency committee on back contamination met in atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts , on those who had joined them in quarantine ( nasa physician william carpentier and mqf project engineer john hirasaki ) , and on columbia itself . loose equipment from the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on august 13 , the three astronauts rode in ticker - tape parades in their honor in new york and chicago , with an estimated six million attendees . on the same evening in los angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight , attended by members of congress , 44 governors , chief justice of the united states warren burger and his predecessor , earl warren , and ambassadors from 83 nations at the century plaza hotel . nixon and agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the presidential medal of freedom . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of congress on september 16 , 1969 . they presented two us flags , one to the house of representatives and the other to the senate , that they had carried with them to the surface of the moon . the flag of american samoa on apollo 11 is on display at the jean haydon museum in pago pago , the capital of american samoa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this celebration began a 38 - day world tour that brought the astronauts to 22 foreign countries and included visits with the leaders of many countries . the crew toured from september 29 to november 5 . many nations honored the first human moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break humans walking on the moon and returning safely to earth accomplished kennedys goal set eight years earlier . in mission control during the apollo 11 landing , kennedys speech flashed on the screen , followed by the words " task accomplished , july 1969 " . and with the success of apollo 11 , america had won the space race . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break new phrases permeated into the english language . " if they can send a man to the moon , why cant they ? " became a common saying following apollo 11 . armstrongs words on the lunar surface also spun off various parodies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while most people celebrated the accomplishment , disenfranchised americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in america , evidenced by protesters led by ralph abernathy outside of kennedy space center the day before apollo 11 launched . nasa administrator thomas paine met with abernathy at the occasion , both hoping that the space program can spur progress also in other regards , such as poverty in the us . racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens who wondered why money spent on the apollo program was not spent taking care of humans on earth . a poem by gil scott -

*********** Article 58: Apollo 8 ***********

apollo 8 ( december 21–27 , 1968 ) was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low earth orbit and the first human spaceflight to reach the moon . the crew orbited the moon ten times without landing , and then departed safely back to earth . these three astronauts—frank borman , james lovell , and william anders—were the first humans to personally witness and photograph the far side of the moon and an earthrise . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 8 launched on december 21 , 1968 , and was the second crewed spaceflight mission flown in the united states apollo space program after apollo7 , which stayed in earth orbit . apollo8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the saturn v rocket , and was the first human spaceflight from the kennedy space center , located adjacent to cape kennedy air force station in florida . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break originally planned as the second crewed apollo lunar module and command module test , to be flown in an elliptical medium earth orbit in early 1969 , the mission profile was changed in august 1968 to a more ambitious command - module - only lunar orbital flight to be flown in december , as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight . astronaut jim mcdivitts crew , who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low earth orbit , became the crew for the apollo9 mission , and bormans crew were moved to the apollo8 mission . this left bormans crew with two to three months ' less training and preparation time than originally planned , and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 8 took 68 hours ( almost three days ) to travel the distance to the moon . the crew orbited the moon ten times over the course of twenty hours , during which they made a christmas eve television broadcast in which they read the first ten verses from the book of genesis . at the time , the broadcast was the most watched tv program ever . apollo8 ' s successful mission paved the way for apollo11 to fulfill president john kennedys goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade . the apollo8 astronauts returned to earth on december 27 , 1968 , when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern pacific ocean . the crew members were named time magazines " men of the year " for 1968 upon their return . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the late 1950s and early 1960s , the united states was engaged in the cold war , a geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union . on october 4 , 1957 , the soviet union launched sputnik 1 , the first artificial satellite . this unexpected success stoked fears and imaginations around the world . it not only demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances , it challenged american claims of military , economic , and technological superiority . the launch precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break president john kennedy believed that not only was it in the national interest of the united states to be superior to other nations , but that the perception of american power was at least as important as the actuality . it was therefore intolerable to him for the soviet union to be more advanced in the field of space exploration . he was determined that the united states should compete , and sought a challenge that maximized its chances of winning . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the soviet union had heavier - lifting carrier rockets , which meant kennedy needed to choose a goal that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry , one where the us and soviet union would be starting from a position of equality—something spectacular , even if it could not be justified on military , economic , or scientific grounds . after consulting with his experts and advisors , he chose such a project : to land a man on the moon and return him to the earth . this project already had a name : project apollo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an early and crucial decision was the adoption of lunar orbit rendezvous , under which a specialized spacecraft would land on the lunar surface . the apollo spacecraft therefore had three primary components : a command module ( cm ) with a cabin for the three astronauts , and the only part that would return to earth ; a service module ( sm ) to provide the command module with propulsion , electrical power , oxygen , and water ; and a two - stage lunar module ( lm ) , which comprised a descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to return the astronauts to lunar orbit . this configuration could be launched by the saturn v rocket that was then under development . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the initial crew assignment of frank borman as commander , michael collins as command module pilot ( cmp ) and william anders as lunar module pilot ( lmp ) for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced on november 20 , 1967 . collins was replaced by jim lovell in july 1968 , after suffering a cervical disc herniation that required surgery to repair . this crew was unique among pre - space shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew : lovell had flown twice before , on gemini vii and gemini xii . this would also be the first case of a commander of a previous mission ( lovell , gemini xii ) flying as a non - commander . this was also the first mission to reunite crewmates from a previous mission ( lovell and borman , gemini vii ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as of april , 2022 , all three apollo 8 astronauts remain alive . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the backup crew assignment of neil armstrong as commander , lovell as cmp , and buzz aldrin as lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced at the same time as the prime crew . when lovell was reassigned to the prime crew , aldrin was moved to cmp , and fred haise was brought in as backup lmp . armstrong would later command apollo11 , with aldrin as lmp and collins as cmp . haise served on the backup crew of apollo11 as lmp and flew on apollo13 as lmp . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during projects mercury and gemini , each mission had a prime and a backup crew . for apollo , a third crew of astronauts was added , known as the support crew . the support crew maintained the flight plan , checklists , and mission ground rules , and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of any changes . the support crew developed procedures in the simulators , especially those for emergency situations , so that the prime and backup crews could practice and master them in their simulator training . for apollo8 , the support crew consisted of ken mattingly , vance brand , and gerald carr . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the capsule communicator ( capcom ) was an astronaut at the mission control center in houston , texas , who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew . for apollo8 , the capcoms were michael collins , gerald carr , ken mattingly , neil armstrong , buzz aldrin , vance brand , and fred haise . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the mission control teams rotated in three shifts , each led by a flight director . the directors for apollo8 were clifford charlesworth ( green team ) , glynn lunney ( black team ) , and milton windler ( maroon team ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the triangular shape of the insignia refers to the shape of the apollo cm . it shows a red figure8 looping around the earth and moon to reflect both the mission number and the circumlunar nature of the mission . on the bottom of the8 are the names of the three astronauts . the initial design of the insignia was developed by jim lovell , who reportedly sketched it while riding in the back seat of a t - 38 flight from california to houston shortly after learning of apollo8 ' s re - designation as a lunar - orbital mission . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the crew wanted to name their spacecraft , but nasa did not allow it . the crew would have likely chosen columbiad , the name of the giant cannon that launches a space vehicle in jules vernes 1865 novel from the earth to the moon . the apollo11 cm was named columbia in part for that reason . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on september 20 , 1967 , nasa adopted a seven - step plan for apollo missions , with the final step being a moon landing . apollo4 and apollo6 were " a " missions , tests of the saturnv launch vehicle using an uncrewed block i production model of the command and service module ( csm ) in earth orbit . apollo5 was a " b " mission , a test of the lm in earth orbit . apollo7 , scheduled for october 1968 , would be a " c " mission , a crewed earth - orbit flight of the csm . further missions depended on the readiness of the lm . it had been decided as early as may 1967 that there would be at least four additional missions . apollo8 was planned as the " d " mission , a test of the lm in a low earth orbit in december 1968 by james mcdivitt , david scott , and russell schweickart , while bormans crew would fly the " e " mission , a more rigorous lm test in an elliptical medium earth orbit as apollo9 , in early 1969 . the " f " mission would test the csm and lm in lunar orbit , and the " g " mission would be the finale , the moon landing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break production of the lm fell behind schedule , and when apollo8 ' s lm - 3 arrived at the kennedy space center ( ksc ) in june 1968 , more than a hundred significant defects were discovered , leading bob gilruth , the director of the manned spacecraft center ( msc ) , and others to conclude that there was no prospect of lm - 3 being ready to fly in 1968 . indeed , it was possible that delivery would slip to february or march 1969 . following the original seven - step plan would have meant delaying the " d " and subsequent missions , and endangering the programs goal of a lunar landing before the end of 1969 . george low , the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office , proposed a solution in august 1968 to keep the program on track despite the lm delay . since the next csm ( designated as " csm - 103 " ) would be ready three months before lm - 3 , a csm - only mission could be flown in december 1968 . instead of repeating the " c " mission flight of apollo7 , this csm could be sent all the way to the moon , with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit and returning to earth . the new mission would also allow nasa to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until apollo10 , the scheduled " f " mission . this also meant that the medium earth orbit " e " mission could be dispensed with . the net result was that only the " d " mission had to be delayed , and the plan for lunar landing in mid - 1969 could remain on timeline . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on august 9 , 1968 , low discussed the idea with gilruth , flight director chris kraft , and the director of flight crew operations , donald slayton . they then flew to the marshall space flight center ( msfc ) in huntsville , alabama , where they met with ksc director kurt debus , apollo program director samuel phillips , rocco petrone , and wernher von braun . kraft considered the proposal feasible from a flight control standpoint ; debus and petrone agreed that the next saturn v , as - 503 , could be made ready by december 1 ; and von braun was confident the pogo oscillation problems that had afflicted apollo6 had been fixed . almost every senior manager at nasa agreed with this new mission , citing confidence in both the hardware and the personnel , along with the potential for a circumlunar flight providing a significant morale boost . the only person who needed some convincing was james webb , the nasa administrator . backed by the full support of his agency , webb authorized the mission . apollo8 was officially changed from a " d " mission to a " c - prime " lunar - orbit mission . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the change in mission for apollo 8 , slayton asked mcdivitt if he still wanted to fly it . mcdivitt turned it down ; his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the lm , and that was what he still wanted to do . slayton then decided to swap the prime and backup crews of the dand emissions . this swap also meant a swap of spacecraft , requiring bormans crew to use csm - 103 , while mcdivitts crew would use csm - 104 , since cm - 104 could not be made ready by december . david scott was not happy about giving up cm - 103 , the testing of which he had closely supervised , for cm - 104 , although the two were almost identical , and anders was less than enthusiastic about being an lmp on a flight with no lm . instead , in order that the spacecraft would have the correct weight and balance , apollo8 would carry lm test article , a boilerplate model of lm - 3 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break added pressure on the apollo program to make its 1969 landing goal was provided by the soviet unions zond5 mission , which flew some living creatures , including russian tortoises , in a cislunar loop around the moon and returned them to earth on september 21 . there was speculation within nasa and the press that they might be preparing to launch cosmonauts on a similar circumlunar mission before the end of 1968 . compounding these concerns , american reconnaissance satellites observed a mockup n1 being rolled to the pad at baikonur in november 1967 , with more activity in 1968 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the apollo 8 crew , now living in the crew quarters at kennedy space center , received a visit from charles lindbergh and his wife , anne morrow lindbergh , the night before the launch . they talked about how , before his 1927 flight , lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from new york city to paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight . the total he had carried was a tenth of the amount that the saturn v would burn every second . the next day , the lindberghs watched the launch of apollo8 from a nearby dune . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the saturn v rocket used by apollo8 was designated as - 503 , or the " 03rd " model of the saturnv ( " 5 " ) rocket to be used in the apollo - saturn ( " as " ) program . when it was erected in the vehicle assembly building on december 20 , 1967 , it was thought that the rocket would be used for an uncrewed earth - orbit test flight carrying a boilerplate command and service module . apollo6 had suffered several major problems during its april 1968 flight , including severe pogo oscillation during its first stage , two second - stage engine failures , and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit . without assurances that these problems had been rectified , nasa administrators could not justify risking a crewed mission until additional uncrewed test flights proved the saturn v was ready . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break teams from the msfc went to work on the problems of primary concern was the pogo oscillation , which would not only hamper engine performance , but could exert significant g - forces on a crew . a task force of contractors , nasa agency representatives , and msfc researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated , causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket . a system that used helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight . researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum , causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two . when an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two , it had accidentally shut down engine threes liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection . as a result , engine three failed within one second of engine twos shutdown . further investigation revealed the same problem for the third - stage engine—a faulty igniter line . the team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits , hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the teams tested their solutions in august 1968 at the msfc . a saturn stage ic was equipped with shock - absorbing devices to demonstrate the teams solution to the problem of pogo oscillation , while a saturn stage ii was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions . once nasa administrators were convinced that the problems had been solved , they gave their approval for a crewed mission using as - 503 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the apollo 8 spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on september 21 , and the rocket made the slow 3 mi journey to the launch pad on october9 . testing continued all through december until the day before launch , including various levels of readiness testing from december5 through 11 . final testing of modifications to address the problems of pogo oscillation , ruptured fuel lines , and bad igniter lines took place on december 18 , three days before the scheduled launch . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as the first crewed spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body , apollo8 ' s profile had two different sets of orbital parameters , separated by a translunar injection maneuver . apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal 100 nmi circular earth parking orbit . apollo8 was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of 99 nmi and a perigee of 99 nmi , with an inclination of 32° to the equator , and an orbital period of 88 minutes . propellant venting increased the apogee by 6 nmi over the 2hours , 44 minutes , and 30 seconds spent in the parking orbit . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this was followed by a trans - lunar injection ( tli ) burn of the s - ivb third stage for 318 seconds , accelerating the 63650 lb command and service module and 19900 lb lm test article from an orbital velocity of 25567 ft / s to the injection velocity of 35505 ft / s which set a record for the highest speed , relative to earth , that humans had ever traveled . this speed was slightly less than the earths escape velocity of 36747 ft / s , but put apollo8 into an elongated elliptical earth orbit , close enough to the moon to be captured by the moons gravity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the standard lunar orbit for apollo missions was planned as a nominal 60 nmi circular orbit above the moons surface . initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a perilune of 60 nmi and an apolune of 168 nmi , at an inclination of 12° from the lunar equator . this was then circularized at 60 nmi , with an orbital period of 128 minutes . the effect of lunar mass concentrations ( " mascons " ) on the orbit was found to be greater than initially predicted ; over the course of the ten lunar orbits lasting twenty hours , the orbital distance was perturbated to 63 nmi . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 8 achieved a maximum distance from earth of 203752 nmi . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 8 was launched at 12 : 51 : 00 utc ( 07 : 51 : 00 eastern standard time ) on december 21 , 1968 , using the saturn vs three stages to achieve earth orbit . the s - ic first stage landed in the atlantic ocean at , and the s - ii second stage landed at . the s - ivb third stage injected the craft into earth orbit and remained attached to perform the tli burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break once the vehicle reached earth orbit , both the crew and houston flight controllers spent the next 2hours and 38 minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for tli . the proper operation of the s - ivb third stage of the rocket was crucial , and in the last uncrewed test , it had failed to reignite for this burn . collins was the first capcom on duty , and at 2hours , 27 minutes and 22 seconds after launch he radioed , " apollo8 . you are go for tli . " this communication meant that mission control had given official permission for apollo8 to go to the moon . the s - ivb engine ignited on time and performed the tli burn perfectly . over the next five minutes , the spacecrafts speed increased from 7600 m / s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the s - ivb had placed the mission on course for the moon , the command and service modules ( csm ) , the remaining apollo8 spacecraft , separated from it . the crew then rotated the spacecraft to take photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it . as the crew rotated the spacecraft , they had their first views of the earth as they moved away from it—this marked the first time humans had viewed the whole earth at once . borman became worried that the s - ivb was staying too close to the csm and suggested to mission control that the crew perform a separation maneuver . mission control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards earth and using the small reaction control system ( rcs ) thrusters on the service module ( sm ) to add 1 ft / s to their velocity away from the earth , but borman did not want to lose sight of the s - ivb . after discussion , the crew and mission control decided to burn in the earth direction to increase speed , but at 7 ft / s instead . the time needed to prepare and perform the additional burn put the crew an hour behind their onboard tasks . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break five hours after launch , mission control sent a command to the s - ivb to vent its remaining fuel , changing its trajectory . the s - ivb , with the test article attached , posed no further hazard to apollo8 , passing the orbit of the moon and going into a 0 au solar orbit with an inclination of 23° from the plane of the ecliptic , and an orbital period of 340 days . it became a derelict object , and will continue to orbit the sun for many years , if not retrieved . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the apollo 8 crew were the first humans to pass through the van allen radiation belts , which extend up to 15000 mi from earth . scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecrafts high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest x - ray , or 1milligray ( mgy ; during a year , the average human receives a dose of 2to 3mgy ) . to record the actual radiation dosages , each crew member wore a personal radiation dosimeter that transmitted data to earth , as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew . by the end of the mission , the crew members experienced an average radiation dose of 1 mgy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lovells main job as command module pilot was as navigator . although mission control normally performed all the actual navigation calculations , it was necessary to have a crew member adept at navigation so that the crew could return to earth in case communication with mission control was lost . lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft , measuring the angle between a star and the earths ( or the moons ) horizon . this task was made difficult by a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft , which made it hard to distinguish the stars . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by seven hours into the mission , the crew was about 1hour and 40 minutes behind flight plan because of the problems in moving away from the s - ivb and lovells obscured star sightings . the crew placed the spacecraft into passive thermal control ( ptc ) , also called " barbecue roll " , in which the spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft . in direct sunlight , parts of the spacecrafts outer surface could be heated to over 200 c , while the parts in shadow would be - 100 these temperatures could cause the heat shield to crack and propellant lines to burst . because it was impossible to get a perfect roll , the spacecraft swept out a cone as it rotated . the crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first mid - course correction came eleven hours into the flight . the crew had been awake for more than 16 hours . before launch , nasa had decided at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise . borman started the first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises . testing on the ground had shown that the service propulsion system ( sps ) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was " coated " first by burning the engine for a short period . this first correction burn was only 2 seconds and added about 20 ft / s velocity prograde ( in the direction of travel ) . this change was less than the planned 24 ft / s , because of a bubble of helium in the oxidizer lines , which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure . the crew had to use the small rcs thrusters to make up the shortfall . two later planned mid - course corrections were canceled because the apollo8 trajectory was found to be perfect . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break about an hour after starting his sleep shift , borman obtained permission from ground control to take a seconal sleeping pill . the pill had little effect . borman eventually fell asleep , and then awoke feeling ill . he vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea ; this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces , which the crew cleaned up as well as they could . borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems , but lovell and anders wanted to inform mission control . the crew decided to use the data storage equipment ( dse ) , which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to mission control at high speed . after recording a description of bormans illness they asked mission control to check the recording , stating that they " would like an evaluation of the voice comments " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the apollo 8 crew and mission control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied second - floor control room ( there were two identical control rooms in houston , on the second and third floors , only one of which was used during a mission ) . the conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that bormans illness was either a 24 - hour flu , as borman thought , or a reaction to the sleeping pill . researchers now believe that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome , which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their vestibular system adapts to weightlessness . space adaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft ( mercury and gemini ) , because those astronauts could not move freely in the small cabins of those spacecraft . the increased cabin space in the apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement , contributing to symptoms of space sickness for borman and , later , astronaut rusty schweickart during apollo9 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight , except for the crews checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course . during this time , nasa scheduled a television broadcast at 31 hours after launch . the apollo8 crew used a 2 kg camera that broadcast in black - and - white only , using a vidicon tube . the camera had two lenses , a very wide - angle ( 160° ) lens , and a telephoto ( 9° ) lens . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during this first broadcast , the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the earth appeared from space . however , difficulties aiming the narrow - angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the earth impossible . additionally , without proper filters , the earth image became saturated by any bright source . in the end , all the crew could show the people watching back on earth was a bright blob . after broadcasting for 17 minutes , the rotation of the spacecraft took the high - gain antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by this time , the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts . lovell went to sleep 32 - and - a - half hours into the flight– three - and - a - half hours before he had planned to . a short while later , anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill . the crew was unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise . two factors made the moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft : three of the five windows fogging up due to out - gassed oils from the silicone sealant , and the attitude required for passive thermal control . it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 8 made a second television broadcast at 55 hours into the flight . this time , the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the earth through the telephoto lens . although difficult to aim , as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft , the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth . the crew spent the transmission describing the earth , what was visible , and the colors they could see . the transmission lasted 23 minutes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at about 55 hours and 40 minutes into the flight , and 13 hours before entering lunar orbit , the crew of apollo8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body . in other words , the effect of the moons gravitational force on apollo8 became stronger than that of the earth . at the time it happened , apollo8 was 38759 mi from the moon and had a speed of 3990 ft / s relative to the moon . this historic moment was of little interest to the crew , since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at kennedy space center . they would continue to do so until they performed their last mid - course correction , switching to a reference frame based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the last major event before lunar orbit insertion ( loi ) was a second mid - course correction . it was in retrograde ( against the direction of travel ) and slowed the spacecraft down by 2 ft / s , effectively reducing the closest distance at which the spacecraft would pass the moon . at exactly 61 hours after launch , about 24200 mi from the moon , the crew burned the rcs for 11 seconds . they would now pass 71 mi from the lunar surface . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at 64 hours into the flight , the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit insertion1 ( loi - 1 ) . this maneuver had to be performed perfectly , and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the moon , out of contact with the earth . after mission control was polled for a " go / no go " decision , the crew was told at 68 hours that they were go and " riding the best bird we can find " . lovell replied , " well see you on the other side " , and for the first time in history , humans travelled behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with ten minutes remaining before loi - 1 , the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in its correct position . at that time , they finally got their first glimpses of the moon . they had been flying over the unlit side , and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight obliquely illuminating the lunar surface . the loi burn was only two minutes away , so the crew had little time to appreciate the view . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the sps was ignited at 69 hours , 8minutes , and 16 seconds after launch and burned for 4minutes and 7seconds , placing the apollo8 spacecraft in orbit around the moon . the crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives . if the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time , the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly elliptical lunar orbit or even been flung off into space . if it had lasted too long , they could have struck the moon . after making sure the spacecraft was working , they finally had a chance to look at the moon , which they would orbit for the next 20 hours . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on earth , mission control continued to wait . if the crew had not burned the engine , or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time , the crew would have appeared early from behind the moon . exactly at the calculated moment the signal was received from the spacecraft , indicating it was in a 193 mi orbit around the moon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after reporting on the status of the spacecraft , lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over . one of the crews major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on the moon , especially one in mare tranquillitatis that was planned as the apollo11 landing site . the launch time of apollo8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site . a film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record one frame per second of the moon below . bill anders spent much of the next 20 hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest . by the end of the mission , the crew had taken over eight hundred 70mm still photographs and 700 ft of 16mm movie film . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with earth , borman kept asking how the data for the sps looked . he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary . he also asked that they receive a " go / no go " decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon , the crew set up equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface . anders described the craters that they were passing over . at the end of this second orbit , they performed an 11 - second loi - 2 burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to 70 mi . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break throughout the next two orbits , the crew continued to check the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the moon . during the third pass , borman read a small prayer for his church . he had been scheduled to participate in a service at st . christophers episcopal church near seabrook , texas , but due to the apollo8 flight , he was unable to attend . a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control , rod rose , suggested that borman read the prayer , which could be recorded and then replayed during the service . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front , the crew witnessed an " earthrise " in person for the first time in human history . anders saw the earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others , taking a black - and - white photograph as he did so . anders asked lovell for color film and then took earthrise , a now famous color photo , later picked by life magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to the synchronous rotation of the moon about the earth , earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface . this is because , as seen from any one place on the moons surface , earth remains in approximately the same position in the lunar sky , either above or below the horizon . earthrise is generally visible only while orbiting the moon , and at selected surface locations near the moons limb , where libration carries the earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anders continued to take photographs while lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so that borman could rest . despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft , borman was able to sleep for two orbits , awakening periodically to ask questions about their status . borman awoke fully when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes . they were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for the answers to be repeated . borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good nights sleep in over three days . he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed . anders initially protested , saying that he was fine , but borman would not be swayed . anders finally agreed under the condition that borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic pictures of the moon . borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned , and with so many people expected to be watching , he wanted the crew to be alert . for the next two orbits , anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as they rounded the moon for the ninth time , the astronauts began the second television transmission . borman introduced the crew , followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the moon . borman described it as being " a vast , lonely , forbidding expanse of nothing " . then , after talking about what they were flying over , anders said that the crew had a message for all those on earth . each man on board read a section from the biblical creation story from the book of genesis . borman finished the broadcast by wishing a merry christmas to everyone on earth . his message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit . borman said , " and from the crew of apollo8 , we close with good night , good luck , a merry christmas and god bless all of you—all of you on the good earth . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the trans - earth injection ( tei ) , which was scheduled for hours after the end of the television transmission . the tei was the most critical burn of the flight , as any failure of the sps to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit , with little hope of escape . as with the previous burn , the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the moon , out of contact with earth . the burn occurred exactly on time . the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re - emerged from behind the moon at 89 hours , 28 minutes , and 39 seconds , the exact time calculated . when voice contact was regained , lovell announced , " please be informed , there is a santa claus " , to which ken mattingly , the current capcom , replied , " thats affirmative , you are the best ones to know . " the spacecraft began its journey back to earth on december 25 , christmas day . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break later , lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings , maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the computer keyboard . he accidentally erased some of the computers memory , which caused the inertial measurement unit ( imu ) to contain data indicating that the module was in the same relative orientation it had been in before lift - off ; the imu then fired the thrusters to " correct " the modules attitude . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break once the crew realized why the computer had changed the modules attitude , they realized that they would have to reenter data to tell the computer the modules actual orientation . it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers , using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned , and another 15 minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer . sixteen months later , during the apollo13 mission , lovell would have to perform a similar manual realignment under more critical conditions after the modules imu had to be turned off to conserve energy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the cruise back to earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft . as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly , the spacecraft would reenter earths atmosphere two - and - a - half days after tei and splash down in the pacific . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on christmas afternoon , the crew made their fifth television broadcast . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this time , they gave a tour of the spacecraft , showing how an astronaut lived in space . when they finished broadcasting , they found a small present from slayton in the food locker : a real turkey dinner with stuffing , in the same kind of pack given to the troops in vietnam . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature bottles of brandy , which borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed . they remained unopened , even years after the flight . there were also small presents to the crew from their wives . the next day , at about 124 hours into the mission , the sixth and final tv transmission showed the missions best video images of the earth , during a four - minute broadcast . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after two uneventful days , the crew prepared for reentry . the computer would control the reentry , and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude , with the blunt end forward . in the event of computer failure , borman was ready to take over . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break separation from the service module prepared the command module for reentry by exposing the heat shield and shedding unneeded mass . the service module would burn up in the atmosphere as planned . six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere , the crew saw the moon rising above the earths horizon , just as had been calculated by the trajectory specialists . as the module hit the thin outer atmosphere , the crew noticed that it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma formed around the spacecraft . the spacecraft started slowing down , and the deceleration peaked at 6 g0 . with the computer controlling the descent by changing the attitude of the spacecraft , apollo8 rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean . at 30000 ft , the drogue parachute deployed , stabilizing the spacecraft , followed at 10000 ft by the three main parachutes . the spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as in the north pacific ocean , southwest of hawaii at 15 : 51 : 42 utc on december 27 , 1968 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when the spacecraft hit the water , the parachutes dragged it over and left it upside down , in what was termed stable2 position . as they were buffeted by a 10 ft swell , borman was sick , waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft . about six minutes after splashdown , the command module was righted into a normal apex - up ( stable 1 ) orientation by its inflatable bag uprighting system . the first frogman from aircraft carrier arrived 43 minutes after splashdown . forty - five minutes later , the crew was safe on the flight deck of the yorktown . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 8 came at the end of 1968 , a year that had seen much upheaval in the united states and most of the world . even though the year saw political assassinations , political unrest in the streets of europe and america , and the prague spring , time magazine chose the crew of apollo8 as its men of the year for 1968 , recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year . they had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as having only a fifty - fifty chance of fully succeeding . the effect of apollo8 was summed up in a telegram from a stranger , received by borman after the mission , that stated simply , " thank you apollo8 . you saved 1968 . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that the crew took as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon . this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture while actually behind the camera , and it has been credited as one of the inspirations of the first earth day in 1970 . it was selected as the first of life magazines 100 photographs that changed the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 11 astronaut michael collins said , " eights momentous historic significance was foremost " ; while space historian robert poole saw apollo8 as the most historically significant of all the apollo missions . the mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first american orbital flight , mercury - atlas 6 by john glenn , in 1962 . there were 1200 journalists covering the mission , with the bbcs coverage broadcast in 54 countries in 15 different languages . the soviet newspaper pravda featured a quote from boris nikolaevich petrov , chairman of the soviet interkosmos program , who described the flight as an " outstanding achievement of american space sciences and technology " . it is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time saw—either live or delayed—the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon . the apollo8 broadcasts won an emmy award , the highest honor given by the academy of television arts sciences . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break madalyn murray ohair , an atheist , later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis . ohair wanted the courts to ban american astronauts—who were all government employees—from public prayer in space . though the case was rejected by the supreme court of the united states , apparently for lack of jurisdiction in outer space , it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program . buzz aldrin , on apollo11 , self - communicated presbyterian communion on the surface of the moon after landing ; he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and referred to it only obliquely at the time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1969 , the united states post office department issued a postage stamp ( scott catalogue 1371 ) commemorating the apollo8 flight around the moon . the stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the earthrise over the moon taken by anders on christmas eve , and the words , " in the beginning god " , the first words of the book of genesis . in january 1969 , just 18 days after the crews return to earth , they appeared in the super bowl iii pre - game show , reciting the pledge of allegiance , before the national anthem was performed by trumpeter lloyd geisler of the washington national symphony orchestra . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in january 1970 , the spacecraft was delivered to osaka , japan , for display in the pavilion at expo ' 70 . it is now displayed at the chicago museum of science and industry , along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by lovell and the space suit worn by frank borman . jim lovells apollo8 space suit is on public display in the visitor center at nasas glenn research center . bill anderss space suit is on display at the science museum in london , united kingdom . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break apollo 8 ' s historic mission has been depicted and referred to in several forms , both documentary and fiction . the various television transmissions and 16 mm footage shot by the crew of apollo8 were compiled and released by nasa in the 1969 documentary debrief : apollo8 , hosted by burgess meredith . in addition , spacecraft films released , in 2003 , a three - disc dvd set containing all of nasas tv and 16mm film footage related to the mission , including all tv transmissions from space , training and launch footage , and motion pictures taken in flight . other documentaries include " race to the moon " ( 2005 ) as part of season 18 of american experience and in the shadow of the moon ( 2007 ) . apollos daring mission aired on pbs ' nova in december 2018 , marking the flights 50th anniversary . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break parts of the mission are dramatized in the 1998 miniseries from the earth to the moon episode " 1968 " . the s - ivb stage of apollo8 was also portrayed as the location of an alien device in the 1970 ufo episode " conflict " . apollo8 ' s lunar orbit insertion was chronicled with actual recordings in the song " the other side " , on the 2015 album the race for space , by the band public service broadcasting . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the credits of the animated film free birds ( 2013 ) a newspaper front page about the apollo 8 mission is doctored to read : " as one of the most turbulent , tragic years in american history drew to a close , millions around the world were watching and listening as the apollo 8 astronauts – frank gobbler , jim snood , and bill wattles – became the first turkeys to orbit another world . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a documentary film , first to the moon : the journey of apollo 8 was released in 2018 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the choral music piece earthrise by luke byrne commemorates the mission . the piece was premièred on january 19 , 2020 , by sydney philharmonia choirs at the sydney opera house . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 59: Astronaut ***********

an astronaut ( from the ancient greek ἄστρον ( astron ) , meaning ' star ' , and ναύτης ( nautes ) , meaning ' sailor ' ) is a person trained , equipped , and deployed by a human spaceflight program to serve as a commander or crew member aboard a spacecraft . although generally reserved for professional space travelers , the term is sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space , including scientists , politicians , journalists , and tourists . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " astronaut " technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of nationality or allegiance ; however , astronauts fielded by russia or the soviet union are typically known instead as cosmonauts ( from the russian " kosmos " ( космос ) , meaning " space " , also borrowed from greek ) in order to distinguish them from american or otherwise nato - oriented space travellers . comparatively recent developments in crewed spaceflight made by china have led to the rise of the term taikonaut ( from the mandarin " tàikōng " ( 太空 ) , meaning " space " ) , although its use is somewhat informal and its origin is unclear . in china , the peoples liberation army astronaut corps astronauts and their foreign counterparts are all officially called hángtiānyuán ( 航天员 , meaning " heaven navigator " or literally " heaven - sailing staff " ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since 1961 , 600 astronauts have flown in space . until 2002 , astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments , either by the military or by civilian space agencies . with the suborbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in 2004 , a new category of astronaut was created : the commercial astronaut . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary , with some focus on the point where the atmosphere becomes so thin that centrifugal force , rather than aerodynamic force , carries a significant portion of the weight of the flight object . the fédération aéronautique internationale ( fai ) sporting code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed the kármán line , at an altitude of 100 km . in the united states , professional , military , and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of 50 mi are awarded astronaut wings . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break , 552 people from 36 countries have reached 100 km or more in altitude , of whom 549 reached low earth orbit or beyond . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break of these , 24 people have traveled beyond low earth orbit , either to lunar orbit , the lunar surface , or , in one case , a loop around the moon . three of the 24—jim lovell , john young and eugene cernan—did so twice . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break , under the definition , 558 people qualify as having reached space , above 50 mi altitude . of eight x - 15 pilots who exceeded 50 mi in altitude , only one , joseph walker , exceeded 100 kilometers ( about 62 miles ) and he did it two times , becoming the first person in space twice . , the man with the longest cumulative time in space is gennady padalka , who has spent 879 days in space . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1959 , when both the united states and soviet union were planning , but had yet to launch humans into space , nasa administrator keith glennan and his deputy administrator , hugh dryden , discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts . dryden preferred " cosmonaut " , on the grounds that flights would occur in and to the broader cosmos , while the " astro " prefix suggested flight specifically to the stars . most nasa space task group members preferred " astronaut " , which survived by common usage as the preferred american term . when the soviet union launched the first man into space , yuri gagarin in 1961 , they chose a term which anglicizes to " cosmonaut " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a professional space traveler is called an astronaut . the first known use of the term " astronaut " in the modern sense was by neil jones in his 1930 short story " the deaths head meteor " . the word itself had been known earlier ; for example , in percy gregs 1880 book across the zodiac , " astronaut " referred to a spacecraft . in les navigateurs de linfini ( 1925 ) by - h . rosny aîné , the word astronautique ( astronautic ) was used . the word may have been inspired by " aeronaut " , an older term for an air traveler first applied in 1784 to balloonists . an early use of " astronaut " in a non - fiction publication is eric frank russells poem " the astronaut " , appearing in the november 1934 bulletin of the british interplanetary society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in 1950 , and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond . nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its astronaut corps . the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its astronaut corps . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by convention , an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency ( or its soviet predecessor ) is called a cosmonaut in english texts . other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian kosmonavt , such as the ( although polish also uses astronauta , and the two words are considered synonyms ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break coinage of the term космонавт has been credited to soviet aeronautics ( or " cosmonautics " ) pioneer mikhail tikhonravov ( 1900–1974 ) . the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin , also the first person in space . he was part of the first six russians , with german titov , yevgeny khrunov , andriyan nikolayev , pavel popovich , and grigoriy nelyubov , who were given the title of pilot - cosmonaut in january 1961 . valentina tereshkova was the first female cosmonaut and the first and youngest woman to have flown in space with a solo mission on the vostok 6 in 1963 . on 14 march 1995 , norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle , and thus became the first " american cosmonaut " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in chinese , the term yǔ háng yuán ( 宇航员 , " cosmos navigating personnel " ) is used for astronauts and cosmonauts in general , while hángtiān yuán ( 航天员 , " navigating celestial - heaven personnel " ) is used for chinese astronauts . here , hángtiān ( 航天 , literally " heaven - navigating " , or spaceflight ) is strictly defined as the navigation of outer space within the local star system , that is solar system . the phrase tàikōng rén ( 太空人 , " spaceman " ) is often used in hong kong and taiwan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term taikonaut is used by some english - language news media organizations for professional space travelers from china . the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionaries , and the term became more common in 2003 when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou 5 spacecraft . this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese peoples daily since the advent of the chinese space program . the origin of the term is unclear ; as early as may 1998 , chiew lee yih ( 趙裡昱 ) from malaysia , used it in newsgroups . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for its 2022 astronaut group , esa envisions recruiting an astronaut with a physical disability , a category they called " parastronauts " , with the intention but not guarantee of spaceflight . the categories of disability considered for the program were individuals with lower limb deficiency ( either through amputation or congenital ) , leg length difference , or a short stature ( less than 130 cm ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the rise of space tourism , nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term " spaceflight participant " to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while no nation other than russia ( and previously the soviet union ) , the united states , and china have launched a crewed spacecraft , several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries , for example the soviet - led interkosmos program . inspired partly by these missions , other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage . for example , the term spationaut is sometimes used to describe french space travelers , from the latin word spatium for " space " ; the malay term angkasawan ( deriving from angkasa meaning ' space ' ) was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program ( note its similarity with the indonesian term antariksawan ) . plans of the indian space research organisation to launch its crewed gaganyaan spacecraft have spurred at times public discussion if another term than astronaut should be used for the crew members , suggesting vyomanaut ( from the sanskrit word व्योमन् / vyoman meaning ' sky ' or ' space ' ) or gagannaut ( from the sanskrit word gagan for ' sky ' ) . in finland , the nasa astronaut timothy kopra , a finnish american , has sometimes been referred to as sisunautti , from the finnish word sisu . across germanic languages , " astronaut " is used in conjunction with locally derived words like germans raumfahrer , dutchs ruimtevaarder , swedishs rymdfarare and norwegians romfarer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as of 2021 in the united states , astronaut status is conferred on a person depending on the authorizing agency : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on july 20 , 2021 , the faa issued an order redefining the eligibility criteria to be an astronaut in response to the private suborbital spaceflights of jeff bezos and richard branson . the new criteria states that one must have " demonstrated activities during flight that were essential to public safety , or contributed to uvmr_ev_paragraph_break human space flight safety " in order to qualify as an astronaut . this new definition excludes bezos and branson . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first human in space was soviet yuri gagarin , who was launched on 12 april 1961 , aboard vostok 1 and orbited around the earth for 108 minutes . the first woman in space was soviet valentina tereshkova , who launched on 16 june 1963 , aboard vostok 6 and orbited earth for almost three days . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alan shepard became the first american and second person in space on 5 may 1961 , on a 15 -

*********** Article 60: A Modest Proposal ***********

a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being a burthen to their parents or country , and for making them beneficial to the publick , commonly referred to as a modest proposal , is a juvenalian satirical essay written and published anonymously by jonathan swift in 1729 . the essay suggests that the impoverished irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food to rich gentlemen and ladies . this satirical hyperbole mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor , predominantly irish catholic ( that is , " papists " ) as well as british policy toward the irish in general . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in english writing , the phrase " a modest proposal " is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight - faced satire . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break swifts essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the english language . much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in ireland , so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of swifts solution when he states : " a young healthy child well nursed , is , at a year old , a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food , whether stewed , roasted , baked , or boiled ; and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee , or a ragout . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break swift goes to great lengths to support his argument , including a list of possible preparation styles for the children , and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion . he uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then - influential william petty and the social engineering popular among followers of francis bacon . these lampoons include appealing to the authority of " a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london " and " the famous psalmanazar , a native of the island formosa " ( who had already confessed to not being from formosa in 1706 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the tradition of roman satire , swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by paralipsis : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break therefore i repeat , let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients , ' till he hath at least some glympse of hope , that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break george wittkowsky argued that swifts main target in a modest proposal was not the conditions in ireland , but rather the can - do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills . swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure - all solution . a memorable example of these sorts of schemes " involved the idea of running the poor through a joint - stock company " . that were in vogue during the early 18th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a modest proposal also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects . the pamphlet targets reformers who " regard people as commodities " . in the piece , swift adopts the " technique of a political arithmetician " to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break critics differ about swifts intentions in using this faux - mathematical philosophy . edmund wilson argues that statistically " the logic of the ' modest proposal ' can be compared with defence of crime ( arrogated to marx ) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break author charles smith argues that swifts rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the irish . swifts specific strategy is twofold , using a " trap " to create sympathy for the irish and a dislike of the narrator who , in the span of one sentence , " details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty " but feels emotion solely for members of his own class . swifts use of gripping details of poverty and his narrators cool approach towards them create " two opposing points of view " that " alienate the reader , perhaps unconsciously , from a narrator who can view with ' melancholy ' detachment a subject that swift has directed us , rhetorically , to see in a much less detached way . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break swift has his proposer further degrade the irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals . lewis argues that the speaker uses " the vocabulary of animal husbandry " to describe the irish . once the children have been commodified , swifts rhetoric can easily turn " people into animals , then meat , and from meat , logically , into tonnage worth a price per pound " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break swift uses the proposers serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal . in making his argument , the speaker uses the conventional , textbook - approved order of argument from swifts time ( which was derived from the latin rhetorician quintilian ) . the contrast between the " careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme " and " the ridiculousness of the proposal " create a situation in which the reader has " to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent , thoughtful , and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break scholars have speculated about which earlier works swift may have had in mind when he wrote a modest proposal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break james william johnson argues that a modest proposal was largely influenced and inspired by tertullians apology : a satirical attack against early roman persecution of christianity . johnson believes that swift saw major similarities between the two situations . johnson notes swifts obvious affinity for tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works a modest proposal and apology . in structure , johnson points out the same central theme , that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument , that " human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it has also been argued that a modest proposal was , at least in part , a response to the 1728 essay the generous projector or , a friendly proposal to prevent murder and other enormous abuses , by erecting an hospital for foundlings and bastard children by swifts rival daniel defoe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bernard mandevilles modest defence of publick stews asked to introduce public and state controlled bordellos . the 1726 paper acknowledges womens interests andwhile not being a completely satirical texthas also been discussed as an inspiration for jonathan swifts title . mandeville had by 1705 already become famous for the fable of the bees and deliberations on private vices and public benefits . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break john locke commented : " be it then as sir robert says , that anciently , it was usual for men to sell and castrate their children . let it be , that they exposed them ; add to it , if you please , for this is still greater power , that they begat them for their tables to fat and eat them : if this proves a right to do so , we may , by the same argument , justifie adultery , incest and sodomy , for there are examples of these too , both ancient and modern ; sins , which i suppose , have the principle aggravation from this , that they cross the main intention of nature , which willeth the increase of mankind , and the continuation of the species in the highest perfection , and the distinction of families , with the security of the marriage bed , as necessary thereunto " . ( first treatise , sec . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break robert phiddians article " have you eaten yet ? the reader in a modest proposal " focuses on two aspects of a modest proposal : the voice of swift and the voice of the proposer . phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of jonathan swift and the apparent economic projections of the proposer . he reminds readers that " there is a gap between the narrators meaning and the texts , and that a moral - political argument is being carried out by means of parody " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while swifts proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal , george wittkowsky , author of " swifts modest proposal : the biography of an early georgian pamphlet " , argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of swifts time . wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century england . " if one regards the modest proposal simply as a criticism of condition , about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that swifts irony brilliantly underscored this fact " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century , it was believed that " people are the riches of the nation " , and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less . furthermore , " in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry " . in those times , the " somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break louis landa composed a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to " become a source of wealth to the nation " or else they " must turn to begging and thievery " . this opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for , diversifying their professions , or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in ireland . landa wrote that , " swift is maintaining that the maxim—people are the riches of a nation—applies to ireland only if ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break landa presents swifts a modest proposal as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that " people are the riches of a nation " . swift presents the dire state of ireland and shows that mere population itself , in irelands case , did not always mean greater wealth and economy . the uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer , not richer . swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox : the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens . swift however , landa argues , is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that england was denying irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break swifts essay created a backlash within the community after its publication . the work was aimed at the aristocracy , and they responded in turn . several members of society wrote to swift regarding the work . lord bathursts letter ( 12 february 1729–30 ) intimated that he certainly understood the message , and interpreted it as a work of comedy : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the more i think upon this scheme , the more reasonable it appears to me ; and it ought by no means to be confined to ireland ; for , in all probability , we shall , in a very little time , be altogether as poor here as you are there . i believe , indeed , we shall carry it farther , and not confine our luxury only to the eating of children ; for i happened to peep the other day into a large assembly parliament not far from westminster - hall , and i found them roasting a great fat fellow , ' again ' for my own part , i had not the least inclination to a slice of him ; but , if i guessed right , four or five of the company had a devilish mind to be at him . well , adieu , you begin now to wish i had ended , when i might have done it so conveniently . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a modest proposal is included in many literature courses as an example of early modern western satire . it also serves as an introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language , lending itself to secondary and post - secondary essay courses . outside of the realm of english studies , a modest proposal is included in many comparative and global literature and history courses , as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts , humanities , and even the social sciences . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a modest video game proposal is the title of an open letter sent by activist / former attorney jack thompson on 10 october 2005 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 2012 horror film butcher boys , written by the original the texas chain saw massacre scribe kim henkel , is said to be an updating of jonathan swifts a modest proposal . henkel imagined the descendants of folks who actually took swift up on his proposal . the film opens with a quote from swift . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 61: Alkali metal ***********

the alkali metals consist of the chemical elements lithium ( li ) , sodium ( na ) , potassium ( k ) , rubidium ( rb ) , caesium ( cs ) , and francium ( fr ) . together with hydrogen they constitute group 1 , which lies in the s - block of the periodic table . all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s - orbital : this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties . indeed , the alkali metals provide the best example of group trends in properties in the periodic table , with elements exhibiting well - characterised homologous behaviour . this family of elements is also known as the lithium family after its leading element . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals are all shiny , soft , highly reactive metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their outermost electron to form cations with charge 1 . they can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness , exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation by atmospheric moisture and oxygen ( and in the case of lithium , nitrogen ) . because of their high reactivity , they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air , and are found naturally only in salts and never as the free elements . caesium , the fifth alkali metal , is the most reactive of all the metals . all the alkali metals react with water , with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds : in order of abundance , sodium is the most abundant , followed by potassium , lithium , rubidium , caesium , and finally francium , which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity ; francium occurs only in minute traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains . experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium ( uue ) , which is likely to be the next member of the group ; none were successful . however , ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects , which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements ; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal , it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most alkali metals have many different applications . one of the best - known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks , of which caesium atomic clocks form the basis of the second . a common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium - vapour lamp , which emits light very efficiently . table salt , or sodium chloride , has been used since antiquity . lithium finds use as a psychiatric medication and as an anode in lithium batteries . sodium and potassium are also essential elements , having major biological roles as electrolytes , and although the other alkali metals are not essential , they also have various effects on the body , both beneficial and harmful . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break toc uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sodium compounds have been known since ancient times ; salt ( sodium chloride ) has been an important commodity in human activities , as testified by the english word salary , referring to salarium , money paid to roman soldiers for the purchase of salt . while potash has been used since ancient times , it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts . georg ernst stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702 , and henri - louis duhamel du monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736 . the exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds , and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium , was not known then , and thus antoine lavoisier did not include either alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in england by humphry davy , who derived it from caustic potash ( koh , potassium hydroxide ) by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile . previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassiums extreme reactivity . later that same year , davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda ( naoh , lye ) by a similar technique , demonstrating the elements , and thus the salts , to be different . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break petalite ( li al si4o10 ) was discovered in 1800 by the brazilian chemist josé bonifácio de andrada in a mine on the island of utö , sweden . however , it was not until 1817 that johan august arfwedson , then working in the laboratory of the chemist jöns jacob berzelius , detected the presence of a new element while analysing petalite ore . this new element was noted by him to form compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium , though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals . berzelius gave the unknown material the name " lithion / lithina " , from the greek word λιθoς ( transliterated as lithos , meaning " stone " ) , to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral , as opposed to potassium , which had been discovered in plant ashes , and sodium , which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood . he named the metal inside the material " lithium " . lithium , sodium , and potassium were part of the discovery of periodicity , as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same group that were noted by johann wolfgang döbereiner in 1850 as having similar properties . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered using the spectroscope , invented in 1859 by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff . the next year , they discovered caesium in the mineral water from bad dürkheim , germany . their discovery of rubidium came the following year in heidelberg , germany , finding it in the mineral lepidolite . the names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectra : a bright red line for rubidium ( from the latin word rubidus , meaning dark red or bright red ) , and a sky - blue line for caesium ( derived from the latin word caesius , meaning sky - blue ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break around 1865 john newlands produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of eight ; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music , where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions . his version put all the alkali metals then known ( lithium to caesium ) , as well as copper , silver , and thallium ( which show the 1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals ) , together into a group . his table placed hydrogen with the halogens . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after 1869 , dmitri mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing lithium at the top of a group with sodium , potassium , rubidium , caesium , and thallium . two years later , mendeleev revised his table , placing hydrogen in group 1 above lithium , and also moving thallium to the boron group . in this 1871 version , copper , silver , and gold were placed twice , once as part of group ib , and once as part of a " group viii " encompassing todays groups 8 to 11 . after the introduction of the 18 - column table , the group ib elements were moved to their current position in the d - block , while alkali metals were left in group ia . later the groups name was changed to group 1 in 1988 . the trivial name " alkali metals " comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group 1 elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before marguerite perey of the curie institute in paris , france discovered francium in 1939 by purifying a sample of actinium - 227 , which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220kev . however , perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80kev . perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product , one that was separated during purification , but emerged again out of the pure actinium - 227 . various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium , radium , lead , bismuth , or thallium . the new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal ( such as coprecipitating with caesium salts ) , which led perey to believe that it was element 87 , caused by the alpha decay of actinium - 227 . perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium - 227 . her first test put the alpha branching at 0 , a figure that she later revised to 1 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the next element below francium ( eka - francium ) in the periodic table would be ununennium ( uue ) , element 119 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is highly unlikely to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level ; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories , and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of superheavy elements . however , given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table , it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions , and indeed an attempt to synthesise it is currently ongoing in japan . currently , none of the period 8 elements has been discovered yet , and it is also possible , due to drip instabilities , that only the lower period 8 elements , up to around element 128 , are physically possible . no attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals : due to their extremely high atomic number , they would require new , more powerful methods and technology to make . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the oddo–harkins rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers , with the exception of hydrogen . this rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another , thus increasing their atomic number . in elements with even atomic numbers , protons are paired , with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other , enhancing stability . all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them ( the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals ) in the solar system . the heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis . lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both big bang nucleosynthesis and in stars : the big bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium , beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 nucleons , and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the triple - alpha process , fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon , and skipping over those three elements . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the sun , but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system . in turn , the natural history of the earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements . the mass of the earth is approximately 5kg . it is composed mostly of iron ( 32 ) , oxygen ( 30 ) , silicon ( 15 ) , magnesium ( 13 ) , sulfur ( 2 ) , nickel ( 1 ) , calcium ( 1 ) , and aluminium ( 1 ) ; with the remaining 1 consisting of trace amounts of other elements . due to planetary differentiation , the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron ( 88 ) , with smaller amounts of nickel ( 5 ) , sulfur ( 4 ) , and less than 1 trace elements . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals , due to their high reactivity , do not occur naturally in pure form in nature . they are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the earths surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica , forming relatively low - density minerals that do not sink down into the earths core . potassium , rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements due to their large ionic radii . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth , both being among the ten most common elements in earths crust ; sodium makes up approximately 2 of the earths crust measured by weight , making it the sixth most abundant element overall and the most abundant alkali metal . potassium makes up approximately 1 of the earths crust and is the seventh most abundant element . sodium is found in many different minerals , of which the most common is ordinary salt ( sodium chloride ) , which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater . other solid deposits include halite , amphibole , cryolite , nitratine , and zeolite . many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating , which still occurs now in places such as utahs great salt lake and the dead sea . despite their near - equal abundance in earths crust , sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean , both because potassiums larger size makes its salts less soluble , and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break despite its chemical similarity , lithium typically does not occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size . its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals , where its crustal concentration is about 18ppm , comparable to that of gallium and niobium . commercially , the most important lithium mineral is spodumene , which occurs in large deposits worldwide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper . it occurs naturally in the minerals leucite , pollucite , carnallite , zinnwaldite , and lepidolite , cite journal title trace element chemistry of lithium - rich micas from rare - element granitic pegmatites volume 55 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break francium - 223 , the only naturally occurring isotope of francium , in a given sample of uranium , there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1018 uranium atoms it has been calculated that there are at most 30grams of francium in the earths crust at any time , due to its extremely short half - life of 22 minutes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration , which results in weak metallic bonding . hence , all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities , melting and boiling points , as well as heats of sublimation , vaporisation , and dissociation . they all crystallise in the body - centered cubic crystal structure , and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited . the ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii , as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity . their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s - orbital to form the 1 oxidation state , due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy . most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group . the chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity ; thus , the presentation of its properties here is limited . what little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium , as expected . the physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed ; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other . increasing reactivity , and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation . in general , their densities increase when moving down the table , with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium . one of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials : lithiums value is anomalous , being more negative than the others . this is because the li ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase : though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly , causing a higher change in entropy , this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal , despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the stable alkali metals are all silver - coloured metals except for caesium , which has a pale golden tint : it is one of only three metals that are clearly coloured ( the other two being copper and gold ) . additionally , the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium , strontium , and barium , as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium , are pale yellow , though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium . their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation . they all crystallise in the body - centered cubic crystal structure , and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited . indeed , these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature . they react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides , which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride ( li f ) . because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron . not only do the alkali metals react with water , but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols , gaseous ammonia , and alkynes , the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity . their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionisation potentials . alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides , which are salts with trapped electrons acting as anions . a particularly striking example of an alkalide is " inverse sodium hydride " , hna− ( both ions being complexed ) , as opposed to the usual sodium hydride , nah− : it is unstable in isolation , due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium , although several derivatives are predicted to be metastable or stable . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in aqueous solution , the alkali metal ions form aqua ions of the formula m ( h2o ) n , where n is the solvation number . their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii . in aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the first coordination sphere , also known as the first , or primary , solvation shell . the bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond , with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond . each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules . the latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere . however , for the alkali metal cations , the second coordination sphere is not well - defined as the 1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarise the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere , producing a more stable entity . while it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions , it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the k ( h2o ) 8 and rb ( h2o ) 8 ions , which have the square antiprismatic structure , and that caesium forms the 12 - coordinate cs ( h2o ) 12 ion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small li cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water , and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent . conversely , lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals , probably because li has a high solvation energy . this effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form , because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic : this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide to be used in dehumidifiers and air - conditioners . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high atomic weight , causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic effects more prominent . in contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativities and ionisation energies of the alkali metals , franciums electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesiums due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons ; also , its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low . thus , contrary to expectation , caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals , not francium . and the enthalpy of dissociation of the fr2 molecule ( 42 kj / mol ) . the csfr molecule is polarised as csfr− , showing that the 7s subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the 6s subshell of caesium . additionally , francium superoxide ( fro2 ) is expected to have significant covalent character , unlike the other alkali metal superoxides , because of bonding contributions from the 6p electrons of francium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers ; hence , their isotopes must be either odd–odd ( both proton and neutron number are odd ) or odd–even ( proton number is odd , but neutron number is even ) . odd–odd nuclei have even mass numbers , whereas odd–even nuclei have odd mass numbers . odd–odd primordial nuclides are rare because most odd–odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay , because the decay products are even–even , and are therefore more strongly bound , due to nuclear pairing effects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to the great rarity of odd–odd nuclei , almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even ( the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium - 6 and the long - lived radioisotope potassium - 40 ) . for a given odd mass number , there can be only a single beta - stable nuclide , since there is not a difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd , leaving other nuclides of the same mass number ( isobars ) free to beta decay toward the lowest - mass nuclide . an effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd - numbered elements , such as the alkali metals , tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even - numbered elements . of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope , all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons . beryllium is the single exception to both rules , due to its low atomic number . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope : sodium - 22 and sodium - 24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically , potassium - 40 and rubidium - 87 have very long half - lives and thus occur naturally , although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes . ( francium had not been discovered yet at that time . the natural long - lived radioisotope of potassium , potassium - 40 , makes up about 0 of natural potassium , and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive . this natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 ( the next alkali metal after caesium ) in 1925 . natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive , with 27 being the long - lived radioisotope rubidium - 87 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break caesium - 137 , with a half - life of 30years , is one of the two principal medium - lived fission products , along with strontium - 90 , which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling , up to several hundred years after use . it constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the chernobyl accident . caesium - 137 undergoes high - energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium - 137 . it is a strong emitter of gamma radiation . caesium - 137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way , but must be allowed to decay . caesium - 137 has been used as a tracer in hydrologic studies , analogous to the use of tritium . small amounts of caesium - 134 and caesium - 137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents , most notably the goiânia accident and the chernobyl disaster . as of 2005 , caesium - 137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the chernobyl nuclear power plant . its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the short - to - medium - lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts , and is taken up by the body , which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group are to each other . for instance , when moving down the table , all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius , in general , their densities increase when moving down the table , with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group . in the alkali metals , the outermost electron only feels a net charge of 1 , as some of the nuclear charge ( which is equal to the atomic number ) is cancelled by the inner electrons ; the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge . therefore , the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells . since this number increases down the group , the atomic radius must also increase down the group . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ionic radii of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii . this is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons , and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller . additionally , the effective nuclear charge has increased , and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first ionisation energy of an element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge 1 . the factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge , the amount of shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus , which is always an outer electron in main group elements . the first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels . since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge ( 1 ) , the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus . since this distance increases down the group , the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases . ( this trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic stabilisation and contraction of the 7s orbital , bringing franciums valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non - relativistic calculations . this makes franciums outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus , increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the second - most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled electron shell and is thus difficult to remove . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group . this is the result of a combination of two factors : the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals . because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group , it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions , thus increasing reactivity down the group . the atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element , which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length , making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals . adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to ( but not equal to ) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance . this quantity decreases going down the group , and so does the activation energy ; thus , chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break electronegativity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons ( or electron density ) towards itself . if the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent , the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is 7 in chlorine but is only 1 in sodium . the electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom ( an ionic bond ) . however , if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom , the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller , making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium . hence , the larger alkali metal atoms ( further down the group ) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them . as mentioned previously , francium is expected to be an exception . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break because of the higher electronegativity of lithium , some of its compounds have a more covalent character . for example , lithium iodide ( li i ) will dissolve in organic solvents , a property of most covalent compounds . lithium fluoride ( lif ) is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water , and lithium hydroxide ( lioh ) is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance ( in liquid state ) is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas . as a metal is heated to its melting point , the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around , and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metals boiling point . therefore , the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group . this is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons . as the atoms increase in size going down the group ( because their atomic radius increases ) , the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil , thus lowering the melting and boiling points . ( the increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals all have the same crystal structure ( body - centred cubic ) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms , since density is defined as mass per unit volume . the first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius , which increases going down the group ; thus , the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group . the mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group . thus , the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii ; if figures for these two factors are known , the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated . the resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table , with an exception at potassium . due to having the lowest atomic weight and the largest atomic radius of all the elements in their periods , the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table . lithium , sodium , and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water : in fact , lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions , which well illustrate group trends . these compounds can be described as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions . this description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase , and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable . for instance , ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series nacl , na2o , na2s , na3p , na3as , na3sb , na3bi , na . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water , producing an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas . this reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group : lithium reacts steadily with effervescence , but sodium and potassium can ignite , and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers . when an alkali metal is dropped into water , it produces an explosion , of which there are two separate stages . the metal reacts with the water first , breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas ; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals . second , the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas , causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air . this secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water , lake or other body of water , not the initial reaction of the metal with water ( which tends to happen mostly under water ) . the alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break recent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself . all alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water . water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal , leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions . the attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area , causing an exponential increase of ionisation . when the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension , it vigorously explodes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the hydroxides themselves are the most basic hydroxides known , reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides . they easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates , or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides , and may be used to separate thiols from petroleum . they react with amphoteric oxides : for example , the oxides of aluminium , zinc , tin , and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates , zincates , stannates , and plumbates . silicon dioxide is acidic , and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals form many intermetallic compounds with each other and the elements from groups 2 to 13 in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries , some of these have ionic characteristics : taking the alloys with gold , the most electronegative of metals , as an example , naau and kau are metallic , but rbau and csau are semiconductors . an alloy of 41 caesium , 47 sodium , and 12 potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy , −78°c . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements ( aluminium , gallium , indium , and thallium ) , such as natl , are poor conductors or semiconductors , unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements , implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the zintl anions involved . nevertheless , while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters , group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice . for example , natl consists of a polymeric anion ( —tl−— ) n with a covalent diamond cubic structure with na ions located between the anionic lattice . the larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break boron is a special case , being the only nonmetal in group 13 . the alkali metal borides tend to be boron - rich , involving appreciable boron–boron bonding involving deltahedral structures , under high pressure the boron–boron bonding in the lithium borides changes from following wades rules to forming zintl anions like the rest of group 13 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lithium and sodium react with carbon to form acetylides , li2c2 and na2c2 , which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with acetylene . potassium , rubidium , and caesium react with graphite ; their atoms are intercalated between the hexagonal graphite layers , forming graphite intercalation compounds of formulae mc60 ( dark grey , almost black ) , mc48 ( dark grey , almost black ) , mc36 ( blue ) , mc24 ( steel blue ) , and mc8 ( bronze ) ( m k , rb , or cs ) . these compounds are over 200 times more electrically conductive than pure graphite , suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers ( for example ) . while the larger alkali metals ( k , rb , and cs ) initially form mc8 , the smaller ones initially form mc6 , and indeed they require reaction of the metals with graphite at high temperatures around 500°c to form . apart from this , the alkali metals are such strong reducing agents that they can even reduce buckminsterfullerene to produce solid fullerides mnc60 ; sodium , potassium , rubidium , and caesium can form fullerides where n 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 , and rubidium and caesium additionally can achieve n 1 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the carbon group ( silicon , germanium , tin , and lead ) , ionic substances with cage - like structures are formed , such as the silicides m4si4 ( m k , rb , or cs ) , which contains m and tetrahedral ions . the monatomic plumbide ion ( pb4− ) is unknown , and indeed its formation is predicted to be energetically unfavourable ; alkali metal plumbides have complex zintl ions , such as . these alkali metal germanides , stannides , and plumbides may be produced by reducing germanium , tin , and lead with sodium metal in liquid ammonia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lithium , the lightest of the alkali metals , is the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen at standard conditions , and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride . nitrogen is an unreactive gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule ( n2 ) requires a lot of energy . the formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal ( forming m ions ) , the energy required to break the triple bond in n2 and the formation of n3− ions , and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride . the lattice energy is maximised with small , highly charged ions ; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions , only forming ions with a charge of 1 , so only lithium , the smallest alkali metal , can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic , forming lithium nitride . the reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic , so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions . sodium nitride ( na3n ) and potassium nitride ( k3n ) , while existing , are extremely unstable , being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements , and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions . steric hindrance forbids the existence of rubidium or caesium nitride . however , sodium and potassium form colourless azide salts involving the linear anion ; due to the large size of the alkali metal cations , they are thermally stable enough to be able to melt before decomposing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula m3pn ( where m represents an alkali metal and pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus , arsenic , antimony , or bismuth ) . this is due to the greater size of the p3− and as3− ions , so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form . while most metals form arsenides , only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides . the structure of na3as is complex with unusually short na–na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal , and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic . indeed , they have some metallic properties , and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry msb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral zintl structure . bismuthides are not even wholly ionic ; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen at standard conditions . they form various types of oxides , such as simple oxides ( containing the o2− ion ) , peroxides ( containing the ion , where there is a single bond between the two oxygen atoms ) , superoxides ( containing the ion ) , and many others . lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide , but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide . potassium forms a mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide , while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively . their reactivity increases going down the group : while lithium , sodium and potassium merely burn in air , rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric ( spontaneously catch fire in air ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions ( the peroxide and superoxide ) due to their small size . this attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms , forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom . this causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature . this effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium , allowing them to form the less stable peroxides . rubidium and caesium , at the bottom of the group , are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form . because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed , the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised . ( the oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist , but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions . all the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red ozonides ( mo3 ) through low - temperature reaction of the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with ozone : the ozonides may be then extracted using liquid ammonia . they slowly decompose at standard conditions to the superoxides and oxygen , and hydrolyse immediately to the hydroxides when in contact with water . potassium , rubidium , and caesium also form sesquioxides m2o3 , which may be better considered peroxide disuperoxides , . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rubidium and caesium can form a great variety of suboxides with the metals in formal oxidation states below 1 . and several brightly coloured suboxides , such as cs7o ( bronze ) , cs4o ( red - violet ) , cs11o3 ( violet ) , cs3o ( dark green ) , cso , cs3o2 , as well as cs7o2 . the last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate cs2o . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens ( sulfur , selenium , tellurium , and polonium ) , and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known ( with the exception of franciums ) . reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides , with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question . for example , sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide ( na2s ) and various polysulfides with the formula na2sx ( x from 2 to 6 ) , containing the ions . they may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present , and are colourless , water - soluble compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table , the halogens ( fluorine , chlorine , bromine , iodine , and astatine ) , forming salts known as the alkali metal halides . the reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions . all twenty stable alkali metal halides are known ; the unstable ones are not known , with the exception of sodium astatide , because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium . the most well - known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride , otherwise known as common salt . all of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula mx where m is an alkali metal and x is a halogen . they are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points . all the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride ( lif ) , which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy . the high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the li and f− ions , causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong : a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride , consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides , where the hydride anion acts as a pseudohalide : these are often used as reducing agents , producing hydrides , complex metal hydrides , or hydrogen gas . other pseudohalides are also known , notably the cyanides . these are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide , indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely . ternary alkali metal halide oxides , such as na3clo , k3bro ( yellow ) , na4br2o , na4i2o , and k4br2o , are also known . the polyhalides are rather unstable , although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkali metal cations do not usually form coordination complexes with simple lewis bases due to their low charge of just 1 and their relatively large size ; thus the li ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less ( though exceptions occur for weak complexes ) . lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12 , although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode . in aqueous solution , the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes ( m ( h2o ) 6 ) ) , with the exception of the lithium ion , which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes ( li ( h2o ) 4 ) ) ; the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules . because of this , anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants . alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers ( for example 12 - crown - 4 for li , 15 - crown - 5 for na , 18 - crown - 6 for k , and 21 - crown - 7 for rb ) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid ammonia , forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated metal cation m and solvated electron e− , which react to form hydrogen gas and the alkali metal amide ( mnh2 , where m represents an alkali metal ) : this was first noted by humphry davy in 1809 and rediscovered by weyl in 1864 . the process may be speeded up by a catalyst . similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium , strontium , barium , as well as the divalent lanthanides , europium and ytterbium . the amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution , leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals . in 1907 , charles krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons , which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions . at low concentrations ( below 3 m ) , the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride ; at higher concentrations ( above 3 m ) , the solution is copper - coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury . in addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons , such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation ( m ) , the neutral alkali metal atom ( m ) , diatomic alkali metal molecules ( m2 ) and alkali metal anions ( m− ) . these are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas . solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break being the smallest alkali metal , lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds , which are bonded covalently . organolithium compounds are electrically non - conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures , and tend to form oligomers with the structure ( rli ) x where r is the organic group . as the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom , effectively creating a carbanion , organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles . for use as bases , butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available . an example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ( ( ch3li ) x ) , which exists in tetrameric ( x 4 , tetrahedral ) and hexameric ( x 6 , octahedral ) forms organolithium compounds , especially n - butyllithium , are useful reagents in organic synthesis , as might be expected given lithiums diagonal relationship with magnesium , which plays an important role in the grignard reaction . for example , alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls . the reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl , for example , proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde ( using h as the electrophile ) or ketone ( using an alkyl halide ) product . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may also react with n , n - disubstituted amides to give aldehydes and ketones , and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide . they thermally decompose to eliminate a β - hydrogen , producing alkenes and lithium hydride : another route is the reaction of ethers with alkyl - and aryllithiums that act as strong bases . in non - polar solvents , aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are , turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids ( arco2h ) and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols ( ar ' 2c ( ar ) oh ) . finally , they may be used to synthesise other organometallic compounds through metal - halogen exchange . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unlike the organolithium compounds , the organometallic compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic . the application of organosodium compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from organolithium compounds , which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity . the principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide . sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups . organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility . a notable reagent is schlossers base , a mixture of n - butyllithium and potassium tert - butoxide . this reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium ( kch2chch2 ) . cis - 2 - butene and trans - 2 - butene equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals . whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium , it is slow with the heavier alkali metals . the heavier alkali metals also favour the sterically congested conformation . several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported , establishing that they , like the sodium compounds , are polymeric . organosodium , organopotassium , organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble ( or nearly so ) in nonpolar solvents . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkyl and aryl derivatives of sodium and potassium tend to react with air . they cause the cleavage of ethers , generating alkoxides . unlike alkyllithium compounds , alkylsodiums and alkylpotassiums cannot be made by reacting the metals with alkyl halides because wurtz coupling occurs : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as such , they have to be made by reacting alkylmercury compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents . while methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium , methylpotassium is more ionic and has the nickel arsenide structure with discrete methyl anions and potassium cations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals and their hydrides react with acidic hydrocarbons , for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes , to give salts . liquid ammonia , ether , or hydrocarbon solvents are used , the most common of which being tetrahydrofuran . the most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide , nac5h5 , an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives . similarly , the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal cyclooctatetraenides ; for example , dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide ( k2c8h8 ) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives , such as uranocene . the large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large , aromatic , polarisable radical anions , such as the dark - green sodium naphthalenide , nac10h8•− , a strong reducing agent . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reaction with oxygen uvmr_ev_paragraph_break upon reacting with oxygen , alkali metals form oxides , peroxides , superoxides and suboxides . however , the first three are more common . the table below shows the types of compounds formed in reaction with oxygen . the compound in brackets represents the minor product of combustion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metal peroxides are ionic compounds that are unstable in water . the peroxide anion is weakly bound to the cation , and it is hydrolysed , forming stronger covalent bonds . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the other oxygen compounds are also unstable in water . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reaction with sulfur uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with sulfur , they form sulfides and polysulfides . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break because alkali metal sulfides are essentially salts of a weak acid and a strong base , they form basic solutions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reaction with nitrogen uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lithium is the only metal that combines directly with nitrogen at room temperature . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break li3n can react with water to liberate ammonia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reaction with hydrogen uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with hydrogen , alkali metals form saline hydrides that hydrolyse in water . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reaction with carbon uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lithium is the only metal that reacts directly with carbon to give dilithium acetylide . na and k can react with acetylene to give acetylides . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reaction with water uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on reaction with water , they generate hydroxide ions and hydrogen gas . this reaction is vigorous and highly exothermic and the hydrogen resulted may ignite in air or even explode in the case of rb and cs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reaction with other salts uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alkali metals are very good reducing agents . they can reduce metal cations that are less electropositive . titanium is produced industrially by the reduction of titanium tetrachloride with na at 4000c ( van arkel–de boer process ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reaction with organohalide compounds uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkali metals react with halogen derivatives to generate hydrocarbon via the wurtz reaction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkali metals in liquid ammonia uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia or other donor solvents like aliphatic amines or hexamethylphosphoramide to give blue solutions . these solutions are believed to contain free electrons . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to the presence of solvated electrons , these solutions are very powerful reducing agents used in organic synthesis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reaction 1 ) is known as birch reduction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other reductions that can be carried by these solutions are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered , there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of hypothetical heavier alkali metals . being the first period 8 element , the undiscovered element ununennium ( element 119 ) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners ; however , it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties . the relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununenniums electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium ; indeed , ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it . relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium . on the other hand , ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group , being expected to have a melting point between 0°c and 30°c . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the stabilisation of ununenniums valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240pm , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium . although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table ( by the aufbau principle ) would put element 169 , unhexennium , under ununennium , dirac - fock calculations predict that the next element after ununennium with alkali - metal - like properties may be element 165 , unhexpentium , which is predicted to have the electron configuration og 5g18 6f14 7d10 8s2 8p1 / 22 9s1 . this element would be intermediate in properties between an alkali metal and a group 11 element , and while its physical and atomic properties would be closer to the former , its chemistry may be closer to that of the latter . further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium , having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium , and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium , having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium . due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being s - block elements , these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium ( ubn ) and unhexhexium ( uhh ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unsepttrium have not been explored yet as of 2019 , and they may or may not be able to exist . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many other substances are similar to the alkali metals in their tendency to form monopositive cations . analogously to the pseudohalogens , they have sometimes been called " pseudo - alkali metals " . these substances include some elements and many more polyatomic ions ; the polyatomic ions are especially similar to the alkali metals in their large size and weak polarising power . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the element hydrogen , with one electron per neutral atom , is usually placed at the top of group 1 of the periodic table for convenience , but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali metal ; under typical conditions , pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule ( h2 ) ; however , the alkali metals form diatomic molecules ( such as dilithium , li2 ) only at high temperatures , when they are in the gaseous state . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hydrogen , like the alkali metals , has one valence electron it is sometimes placed above fluorine due to their similar chemical properties , though the resemblance is likewise not absolute . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first ionisation energy of hydrogen ( 1312 kj / mol ) is much higher than that of the alkali metals . as only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom , hydrogen often behaves like a halogen , forming the negative hydride ion , and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis . ( the alkali metals can also form negative ions , known as alkalides , but these are little more than laboratory curiosities , being unstable . the electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 k is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 k at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetal - to - metal transition . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 1s1 electron configuration of hydrogen , while analogous to that of the alkali metals ( ns1 ) , is unique because there is no 1p subshell . hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron h , or gain one to form the hydride ion h− . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ammonium ion has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals , acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium , and is often considered a close relative . ammonium is expected to behave stably as a metal ( ions in a sea of delocalised electrons ) at very high pressures ( though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating to metallic behaviour occur around , 100gpa ) , and could possibly occur inside the ice giants uranus and neptune , which may have significant impacts on their interior magnetic fields . it has been estimated that the transition from a mixture of ammonia and dihydrogen molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just below 25gpa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other " pseudo - alkali metals " include the alkylammonium cations , in which some of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups . in particular , the quaternary ammonium cations are very useful since they are permanently charged , and they are often used as an alternative to the expensive cs to stabilise very large and very easily polarisable anions such as . tetraalkylammonium hydroxides , like alkali metal hydroxides , are very strong bases that react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonates . furthermore , the nitrogen atom may be replaced by a phosphorus , arsenic , or antimony atom ( the heavier nonmetallic pnictogens ) , creating a phosphonium or arsonium cation that can itself be substituted similarly ; while stibonium itself is not known , some of its organic derivatives are characterised . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cobaltocene , co ( c5h5 ) 2 , is a metallocene , the cobalt analogue of ferrocene . it is a dark purple solid . cobaltocene has 19 valence electrons , one more than usually found in organotransition metal complexes , such as its very stable relative , ferrocene , in accordance with the 18 - electron rule . this additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the co–c bonds . consequently , many chemical reactions of co ( c5h5 ) 2 are characterized by its tendency to lose this " extra " electron , yielding a very stable 18 - electron cation known as cobaltocenium . many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts , and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate . cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener rhodium to give rhodocene , an even stronger reducing agent . iridocene ( involving iridium ) would presumably be still more potent , but is not very well - studied due to its instability . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break thallium is the heaviest stable element in group 13 of the periodic table . at the bottom of the periodic table , the inert pair effect is quite strong , because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons . and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in dmitri mendeleevs 1869 periodic table and julius lothar meyers 1868 periodic table . ( mendeleevs 1871 periodic table and meyers 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank . while tl is stabilised by the inert pair effect , this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically , so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution . additionally , the thallium halides ( except tlf ) are quite insoluble in water , and tli has an unusual structure because of the presence of the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the group 11 metals ( or coinage metals ) , copper , silver , and gold , are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d - shells . physically , they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with post - transition metals . " the filled d subshell and free s electron of cu , ag , and au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity . transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between s electrons and the partially filled d subshell that lower electron mobility . " chemically , the group 11 metals behave like main - group metals in their 1 valence states , and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals : this is one reason for their previously being labelled as " group ib " , paralleling the alkali metals ' " group ia " . they are occasionally classified as post - transition metals . their spectra are analogous to those of the alkali metals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in mendeleevs 1871 periodic table , copper , silver , and gold are listed twice , once under group viii ( with the iron triad and platinum group metals ) , and once under group ib . group ib was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative . mendeleevs main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element : on that basis , the group 11 elements could not be classified in group ib , due to the existence of copper ( ii ) and gold ( iii ) compounds being known at that time . however , eliminating group ib would make group i the only main group ( group viii was labelled a transition group ) to lack an a–b bifurcation . soon afterward , a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group ib and remove them from group viii for the resulting symmetry : this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium - long 18 - column periodic table , which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group , due to them sharing the characteristic s1 electron configuration of the alkali metals ( group 1 : p6s1 ; group 11 : d10s1 ) . however , the similarities are largely confined to the stoichiometries of the 1 compounds of both groups , and not their chemical properties . this stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell , so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals . furthermore , they have higher melting points , hardnesses , and densities , and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia , as well as having more covalent character in their compounds . finally , the alkali metals are at the top of the electrochemical series , whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom . the coinage metals ' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals ' filled p shell , so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower , enabling higher oxidation states than 1 and a richer coordination chemistry , thus giving the group 11 metals clear transition metal character . particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium , in which it forms the auride ion ( au− ) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution : here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its 5d106s1 configuration has one electron less than the quasi - closed shell 5d106s2 configuration of mercury . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the production of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances , such as water . from their silicate ores , all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way : sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium ( iii ) ions from the ore ( leaching ) , whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide . the remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively ; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride . the result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated . lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides , with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture . the heavier alkali metals , however , are more typically isolated in a different way , where a reducing agent ( typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals ) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride . the liquid or gaseous product ( the alkali metal ) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification . most routes to the pure alkali metals require the use of electrolysis due to their high reactivity ; one of the few which does not is the pyrolysis of the corresponding alkali metal azide , which yields the metal for sodium , potassium , rubidium , and caesium and the nitride for lithium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs , brine pools , and brine deposits . the metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed , extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide . potassium occurs in many minerals , such as sylvite ( potassium chloride ) . found extensively in places such as canada , russia , belarus , germany , israel , united states , and jordan , in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s . it can also be produced from seawater . however , these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures , potentially forming the explosive superoxide . as a result , pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at 850°c . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although sodium is less reactive than potassium , this process works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and can easily be distilled off , so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break metals like sodium are obtained by electrolysis of molten salts . rb cs obtained mainly as by products of li processing . to make pure cesium , ores of cesium and rubidium are crushed and heated to 650°c with sodium metal , generating an alloy that can then be separated via a fractional distillation technique . because metallic cesium is too reactive to handle , it is normally offered as cesium azide ( csn3 ) . cesium hydroxide is formed when cesium interacts aggressively with water and ice ( csoh ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for several years in the 1950s and 1960s , a by - product of the potassium production called alkarb was a main source for rubidium . alkarb contained 21 rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium . today the largest producers of caesium , for example the tanco mine in manitoba , canada , produce rubidium as by - product from pollucite . the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year . caesium , however , is not produced from the above reaction . instead , the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium , extracted from the ore mainly by three methods : acid digestion , alkaline decomposition , and direct reduction . both metals are produced as by - products of lithium production : after 1958 , when interest in lithiums thermonuclear properties increased sharply , the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly . pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at 750°c and low pressure . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a result of its extreme rarity in nature , most francium is synthesised in the nuclear reaction 197au 18o → 210fr 5 n , yielding francium - 209 , francium - 210 , and francium - 211 . the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about 300000 neutral atoms , which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lithium , sodium , and potassium have many applications , while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts but do not have many applications yet . metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sodium compounds have many applications , the most well - known being sodium chloride as table salt . sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap . pure sodium metal also has many applications , including use in sodium - vapour lamps , which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting , and can help smooth the surface of other metals . being a strong reducing agent , it is often used to reduce many other metals , such as titanium and zirconium , from their chlorides . furthermore , it is very useful as a heat - exchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point , viscosity , and cross - section towards neutron absorption . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition . potassium hydroxide is a very strong base , and is used to control the ph of various substances . potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate are often used as powerful oxidising agents . potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks , as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas . pure potassium metal is not often used , but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks . caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate ; if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs , it would be off by less than four seconds ( after 80 million years ) . for that reason , caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second . rubidium ions are often used in purple fireworks , and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break francium has no commercial applications , but because of franciums relatively simple atomic structure , among other things , it has been used in spectroscopy experiments , leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles . studies on the light emitted by laser - trapped francium - 210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels , similar to those predicted by quantum theory . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pure alkali metals are dangerously reactive with air and water and must be kept away from heat , fire , oxidising agents , acids , most organic compounds , halocarbons , plastics , and moisture . they also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride , so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break experiments are usually conducted using only small quantities of a few grams in a fume hood . small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water , but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol . the alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere . the inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas , except for lithium , which reacts with nitrogen . rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air , even under oil , because even a small amount of air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive peroxide ; for the same reason , potassium should not be stored under oil in an oxygen - containing atmosphere for longer than 6 months . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the bioinorganic chemistry of the alkali metal ions has been extensively reviewed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break solid state crystal structures have been determined for many complexes of alkali metal ions in small peptides , nucleic acid constituents , carbohydrates and ionophore complexes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role , but does have effects on the body when ingested . its biochemistry , the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential trace element , although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems , generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cells . sodium chloride ( also known as common salt ) is the principal source of sodium in the diet , and is used as seasoning and preservative , such as for pickling and jerky ; most of it comes from processed foods . the dietary reference intake for sodium is 1grams per day , but most people in the united states consume more than 2grams per day , the minimum amount that promotes hypertension ; this in turn causes 7 million premature deaths worldwide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break potassium is the major cation ( positive ion ) inside animal cells , while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells . the concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells , known as the membrane potential . the balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion transporter proteins in the cell membrane . the cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential—a " spike " of electrical discharge . the ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission , muscle contraction , and heart function . potassium chloride is used in the united states for lethal injection executions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to their similar atomic radii , rubidium and caesium in the body mimic potassium and are taken up similarly . rubidium has no known biological role , but may help stimulate metabolism , and , similarly to caesium , rats can survive up to 50 substitution of potassium by rubidium . rubidium ( and to a much lesser extent caesium ) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia ; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems , caesium is never able to do so . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people , but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic . like rubidium , caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body , but is significantly larger and is therefore a poorer substitute . excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia , arrythmia , and acute cardiac arrest , but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources . as such , caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant . caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy , but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients , on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break radioisotopes of caesium require special precautions : the improper handling of caesium - 137 gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries . perhaps the best - known case is the goiânia accident of 1987 , in which an improperly - disposed - of radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of goiânia , brazil , was scavenged from a junkyard , and the glowing caesium salt sold to curious , uneducated buyers . this led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure . together with caesium - 134 , iodine - 131 , and strontium - 90 , caesium - 137 was among the isotopes distributed by the chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health . radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short half - life , but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 62: Alphabet ***********

an alphabet is a standardized set of basic written symbols or graphemes ( called letters ) that represent the phonemes of certain spoken languages . not all writing systems represent language in this way ; in a syllabary , each character represents a syllable , for instance , and logographic systems use characters to represent words , morphemes , or other semantic units . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first fully phonemic script , the proto - canaanite script , later known as the phoenician alphabet , is considered to be the first alphabet and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets , including arabic , cyrillic , greek , hebrew , latin , and possibly brahmic . it was created by semitic - speaking workers and slaves in the sinai peninsula ( as the proto - sinaitic script ) , by selecting a small number of hieroglyphs commonly seen in their egyptian surroundings to describe the sounds , as opposed to the semantic values , of their own canaanite language . however , peter daniels distinguishes an abugida , or alphasyllabary , a set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters which diacritics modify to represent vowels ( as in devanagari and other south asian scripts ) , an abjad , in which letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants ( as in the original phoenician , hebrew or arabic ) , and an " alphabet " , a set of graphemes that represent both consonants and vowels . in this narrow sense of the word the first true alphabet was the greek alphabet , which was developed on the basis of the earlier phoenician alphabet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break of the dozens of alphabets in use today , the most popular is the latin alphabet , which was derived from the greek , and which is now used by many languages world - wide , often with the addition of extra letters or diacritical marks . while most alphabets have letters composed of lines ( linear writing ) , there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in braille . the khmer alphabet ( for khmer ) is the longest , with 74 letters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters . this makes them useful for purposes of collation , specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order . it also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of " numbering " ordered items , in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the english word alphabet came into middle english from the late latin word alphabetum , which in turn originated in the greek ἀλφάβητος ( alphabētos ) . the greek word was made from the first two letters , alpha ( α ) and beta ( β ) . the names for the greek letters came from the first two letters of the phoenician alphabet ; aleph , which also meant ox , and bet , which also meant house . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sometimes , like in the alphabet song in english , the term " abcs " is used instead of the word " alphabet " ( now i know my abcs ) . " knowing ones abcs " , in general , can be used as a metaphor for knowing the basics about anything . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the history of the alphabet started in ancient egypt . egyptian writing had a set of some 24 hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals , to represent syllables that begin with a single consonant of their language , plus a vowel ( or no vowel ) to be supplied by the native speaker . these glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms , to write grammatical inflections , and , later , to transcribe loan words and foreign names . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the middle bronze age , an apparently " alphabetic " system known as the proto - sinaitic script appears in egyptian turquoise mines in the sinai peninsula dated to circa the 15th century bc , apparently left by canaanite workers . in 1999 , john and deborah darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at wadi el - hol dated to circa 1800 bc and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 bc , strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time . based on letter appearances and names , it is believed to be based on egyptian hieroglyphs . this script had no characters representing vowels , although originally it probably was a syllabary , but unneeded symbols were discarded . an alphabetic cuneiform script with 30 signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in ugarit before the 15th century bc . this script was not used after the destruction of ugarit . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the proto - sinaitic script eventually developed into the phoenician alphabet , which is conventionally called " proto - canaanite " before c . the south arabian alphabet , a sister script to the phoenician alphabet , is the script from which the geez alphabet ( an abugida ) is descended . vowelless alphabets are called abjads , currently exemplified in scripts including arabic , hebrew , and syriac . the omission of vowels was not always a satisfactory solution and some " weak " consonants are sometimes used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable ( matres lectionis ) . these letters have a dual function since they are also used as pure consonants . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the proto - sinaitic or proto - canaanite script and the ugaritic script were the first scripts with a limited number of signs , in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time , cuneiform , egyptian hieroglyphs , and linear the phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters , making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn . another advantage of phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages , since it recorded words phonemically . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the script was spread by the phoenicians across the mediterranean . in greece , the script was modified to add vowels , giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the west . it was the first alphabet in which vowels have independent letter forms separate from those of consonants . the greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in greek to represent vowels . vowels are significant in the greek language , and the syllabical linear b script that was used by the mycenaean greeks from the 16th century bc had 87 symbols , including 5 vowels . in its early years , there were many variants of the greek alphabet , a situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the greek alphabet , in its euboean form , was carried over by greek colonists to the italian peninsula , where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the italic languages . one of these became the latin alphabet , which was spread across europe as the romans expanded their empire . even after the fall of the roman state , the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works . it eventually became used for the descendant languages of latin ( the romance languages ) and then for most of the other languages of western and central europe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some adaptations of the latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures , such as æ in danish and icelandic and ȣ in algonquian ; by borrowings from other alphabets , such as the thorn þ in old english and icelandic , which came from the futhark runes ; and by modifying existing letters , such as the eth ð of old english and icelandic , which is a modified d . other alphabets only use a subset of the latin alphabet , such as hawaiian , and italian , which uses the letters j , k , x , y and w only in foreign words . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another notable script is elder futhark , which is believed to have evolved out of one of the old italic alphabets . elder futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the runic alphabets . the runic alphabets were used for germanic languages from ad 100 to the late middle ages . its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry , although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood . these alphabets have since been replaced with the latin alphabet , except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the old hungarian script is a contemporary writing system of the hungarians . it was in use during the entire history of hungary , albeit not as an official writing system . from the 19th century it once again became more and more popular . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgical language old church slavonic and became , together with the greek uncial script , the basis of the cyrillic script . cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts , and is notable for its use in slavic languages and also for other languages within the former soviet union . cyrillic alphabets include the serbian , macedonian , bulgarian , russian , belarusian and ukrainian . the glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by saints cyril and methodius , while the cyrillic alphabet was invented by clement of ohrid , who was their disciple . they feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by greek and hebrew . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the longest european alphabet is the latin - derived slovak alphabet , which has 46 letters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beyond the logographic chinese writing , many phonetic scripts are in existence in asia . the arabic alphabet , hebrew alphabet , syriac alphabet , and other abjads of the middle east are developments of the aramaic alphabet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most alphabetic scripts of india and eastern asia are descended from the brahmi script , which is often believed to be a descendant of aramaic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in korea , the hangul alphabet was created by sejong the great . hangul is a unique alphabet : it is a featural alphabet , where many of the letters are designed from a sounds place of articulation ( p to look like the widened mouth , l to look like the tongue pulled in , etcetera ) ; its design was planned by the government of the day ; and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions , in the same way as chinese characters , to allow for mixed - script writing ( one syllable always takes up one type - space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound - block ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break zhuyin ( sometimes called bopomofo ) is a semi - syllabary used to phonetically transcribe mandarin chinese in the republic of china . after the later establishment of the peoples republic of china and its adoption of hanyu pinyin , the use of zhuyin today is limited , but it is still widely used in taiwan where the republic of china still governs . zhuyin developed out of a form of chinese shorthand based on chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary . like an alphabet the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual symbols , but like a syllabary the phonemes of the syllable finals are not ; rather , each possible final ( excluding the medial glide ) is represented by its own symbol . for example , luan is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ ( l - u - an ) , where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final - an . while zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system , it is still often used in ways similar to a romanization system—that is , for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for chinese characters on computers and cellphones . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break european alphabets , especially latin and cyrillic , have been adapted for many languages of asia . arabic is also widely used , sometimes as an abjad ( as with urdu and persian ) and sometimes as a complete alphabet ( as with kurdish and uyghur ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term " alphabet " is used by linguists and paleographers in both a wide and a narrow sense . in the wider sense , an alphabet is a script that is segmental at the phoneme level—that is , it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words . in the narrower sense , some scholars distinguish " true " alphabets from two other types of segmental script , abjads and abugidas . these three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels : abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed ; abugidas are also consonant - based but indicate vowels with diacritics to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants . in alphabets in the narrow sense , on the other hand , consonants and vowels are written as independent letters . the earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the wadi el - hol script , believed to be an abjad , which through its successor phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets , including arabic , greek , latin ( via the old italic alphabet ) , cyrillic ( via the greek alphabet ) and hebrew ( via aramaic ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break examples of present - day abjads are the arabic and hebrew scripts ; true alphabets include latin , cyrillic , and korean hangul ; and abugidas are used to write tigrinya , amharic , hindi , and thai . the canadian aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply , since each glyph stands for a consonant that is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel . ( in a true syllabary , each consonant - vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs . ugaritic , for example , is basically an abjad but has syllabic letters for . ( these are the only times that vowels are indicated . cyrillic is basically a true alphabet but has syllabic letters for ( я , е , ю ) ; coptic has a letter for . devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels , though some traditions use अ as a zero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear - cut . for example , sorani kurdish is written in the arabic script , which is normally an abjad . however , in kurdish , writing the vowels is mandatory , and full letters are used , so the script is a true alphabet . other languages may use a semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics , effectively making them abugidas . on the other hand , the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan abugida , but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks . although short a was not written , as in the indic abugidas , one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet . conversely , the vowel marks of the tigrinya abugida and the amharic abugida ( ironically , the original source of the term " abugida " ) have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script . even more extreme , the pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels . for tonal languages , further classification can be based on their treatment of tone , though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types . some alphabets disregard tone entirely , especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load , as in somali and many other languages of africa and the americas . such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels . most commonly , tones are indicated with diacritics , the way vowels are treated in abugidas . this is the case for vietnamese ( a true alphabet ) and thai ( an abugida ) . in thai , tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant , with diacritics for disambiguation . in the pollard script , an abugida , vowels are indicated by diacritics , but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone . more rarely , a script may have separate letters for tones , as is the case for hmong and zhuang . for most of these scripts , regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used , the most common tone is not marked , just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic abugidas ; in zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked , but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone , like the virama of indic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small . the book pahlavi script , an abjad , had only twelve letters at one point , and may have had even fewer later on . today the rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters . ( the hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small , but it actually consists of 18 letters , including the ʻokina and five long vowels . however , hawaiian braille has only 13 letters . while rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent ( just eleven ) , book pahlavi was small because many letters had been conflated—that is , the graphic distinctions had been lost over time , and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in arabic , another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes . for example , a comma - shaped letter represented g , d , y , k , or j . however , such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated . in later pahlavi papyri , up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost , and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all , but instead each word had to be learned as a whole—that is , they had become logograms as in egyptian demotic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the largest segmental script is probably an abugida , devanagari . when written in devanagari , vedic sanskrit has an alphabet of 53 letters , including the visarga mark for final aspiration and special letters for kš and jñ , though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used . the hindi alphabet must represent both sanskrit and modern vocabulary , and so has been expanded to 58 with the khutma letters ( letters with a dot added ) to represent sounds from persian and english . thai has a total of 59 symbols , consisting of 44 consonants , 13 vowels and 2 syllabics , not including 4 diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the largest known abjad is sindhi , with 51 letters . the largest alphabets in the narrow sense include kabardian and abkhaz ( for cyrillic ) , with 58 and 56 letters , respectively , and slovak ( for the latin script ) , with 46 . however , these scripts either count di - and tri - graphs as separate letters , as spanish did with ch and ll until recently , or uses diacritics like slovak č . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the georgian alphabet ( ' ) is an alphabetic writing system . with 33 letters , it is the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent . the original georgian alphabet had 38 letters but 5 letters were removed in the 19th century by ilia chavchavadze . the georgian alphabet is much closer to greek than the other caucasian alphabets . the letter order parallels the greek , with the consonants without a greek equivalent organized at the end of the alphabet . the origins of the alphabet are still unknown . some armenian and western scholars believe it was created by mesrop mashtots ( armenian : մեսրոպ մաշտոց mesrop maštoc ' ) also known as mesrob the vartabed , who was an early medieval armenian linguist , theologian , statesman and hymnologist , best known for inventing the armenian alphabet c . 405 ad ; other georgian and western scholars are against this theory . most scholars link the creation of the georgian script to the process of christianization of iberia , a core georgian kingdom of kartli . the alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of iberia under king mirian iii ( 326 or 337 ) and the bir el qutt inscriptions of 430 , contemporaneously with the armenian alphabet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break syllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs , and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands . thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the armenian alphabet ( ' or հայոց այբուբեն ' ) is a graphically unique alphabetical writing system that has been used to write the armenian language . it was created in year 405 originally contained 36 letters . two more letters , օ ( o ) and ֆ ( f ) , were added in the middle ages . during the 1920s orthography reform , a new letter և ( capital եվ ) was added , which was a ligature before եւ , while the letter ւ ւ was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter ու ու ( which was a digraph before ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the armenian scripts directionality is horizontal left - to - right , like the latin and greek alphabets . it also uses bicameral script like those . the armenian word for " alphabet " is այբուբեն ' , named after the first two letters of the armenian alphabet ա այբ ayb and բ բեն ben . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters , which can then be used for purposes of collation—namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called alphabetical order . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the basic ordering of the latin alphabet ( a uvmr_ev_paragraph_break z ) , which is derived from the northwest semitic " abgad " order , is well established , although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters ( such as the french é , à , and ô ) and of certain combinations of letters ( multigraphs ) . in french , these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation . however , in icelandic , the accented letters such as á , í , and ö are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from the sounds represented by their unaccented counterparts . in spanish , ñ is considered a separate letter , but accented vowels such as á and é are not . the ll and ch were also considered single letters , but in 1994 the real academia española changed the collating order so that ll is between lk and lm in the dictionary and ch is between cg and ci , and in 2010 the tenth congress of the association of spanish language academies changed it so they were no longer letters at all . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in german , words starting with sch - ( which spells the german phoneme ) are inserted between words with initial sca - and sci - ( all incidentally loanwords ) instead of appearing after initial sz , as though it were a single letter—in contrast to several languages such as albanian , in which dh - , ë - , gj - , ll - , rr - , th - , xh - and zh - ( all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters ) would follow the letters d , e , g , l , n , r , t , x and z respectively , as well as hungarian and welsh . further , german words with an umlaut are collated ignoring the umlaut—contrary to turkish that adopted the graphemes ö and ü , and where a word like tüfek , would come after tuz , in the dictionary . an exception is the german telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like ä ae since names such as jäger also appear with the spelling jaeger , and are not distinguished in the spoken language . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the danish and norwegian alphabets end with æ—ø—å , whereas the swedish and finnish ones conventionally put å—ä—ö at the end . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence . some alphabets today , such as the hanunoo script , are learned one letter at a time , in no particular order , and are not used for collation where a definite order is required . however , a dozen ugaritic tablets from the fourteenth century bc preserve the alphabet in two sequences . one , the abcde order later used in phoenician , has continued with minor changes in hebrew , greek , armenian , gothic , cyrillic , and latin ; the other , hmħlq , was used in southern arabia and is preserved today in ethiopic . both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break runic used an unrelated futhark sequence , which was later simplified . arabic uses its own sequence , although arabic retains the traditional abjadi order for numbering . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the brahmic family of alphabets used in india use a unique order based on phonology : the letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth . this organization is used in southeast asia , tibet , korean hangul , and even japanese kana , which is not an alphabet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the phoenician letter names , in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound ( acrophony ) , continue to be used to varying degrees in samaritan , aramaic , syriac , hebrew , greek and arabic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the names were abandoned in latin , which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel ( usually e ) before or after the consonant ; the two exceptions were y and z , which were borrowed from the greek alphabet rather than etruscan , and were known as y graeca " greek y " ( pronounced i graeca " greek i " ) and zeta ( from greek ) —this discrepancy was inherited by many european languages , as in the term zed for z in all forms of english other than american english . over time names sometimes shifted or were added , as in double u for w ( " double v " in french ) , the english name for y , and american zee for comparing names in english and french gives a clear reflection of the great vowel shift : a , b , c and d are pronounced in todays english , but in contemporary french they are . the french names ( from which the english names are derived ) preserve the qualities of the english vowels from before the great vowel shift . by contrast , the names of f , l , m , n and s remain the same in both languages , because " short " vowels were largely unaffected by the shift . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on slavic words ; this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in latin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break letters of armenian alphabet also have distinct letter names . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language , an orthography generally comes into being , providing rules for the spelling of words in that language . in accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based , these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the phonemes ( significant sounds ) of the spoken language . in a perfectly phonemic orthography there would be a consistent one - to - one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes , so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation , and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling , and vice versa . however , this ideal is not usually achieved in practice ; some languages ( such as spanish and finnish ) come close to it , while others ( such as english ) deviate from it to a much larger degree . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system , and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for , so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break languages may fail to achieve a one - to - one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break national languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard . some national languages like finnish , armenian , turkish , russian , serbo - croatian ( serbian , croatian and bosnian ) and bulgarian have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one - to - one correspondence between letters and phonemes . strictly speaking , these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb " to spell " ( meaning to split a word into its letters ) , the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables . similarly , the italian verb corresponding to ' spell ( out ) ' , compitare , is unknown to many italians because spelling is usually trivial , as italian spelling is highly phonemic . in standard spanish , one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling , but not vice versa , as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way , but a given letter is consistently pronounced . french , with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision , may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation , but its rules on pronunciation , though complex , are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the other extreme are languages such as english , where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in a consistent way . for english , this is partly because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography was established , and because english has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times , retaining their original spelling at varying levels . even english has general , albeit complex , rules that predict pronunciation from spelling , and these rules are successful most of the time ; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sometimes , countries have the written language undergo a spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language . these can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself , as when turkey switched from the arabic alphabet to a latin - based turkish alphabet , and as when kazakh changes from an arabic script to a cyrillic script due to the soviet unions influence , and in 2021 , having a transition to the latin alphabet , just like turkish . the cyrillic script used to be official in uzbekistan and turkmenistan before they all switched to the latin alphabets , including uzbekistan that is having a reform of the alphabet to use diacritics on the letters that is marked by apostrophes and the letters that are digraphs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the standard system of symbols used by linguists to represent sounds in any language , independently of orthography , is called the international phonetic alphabet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 63: Atomic number ***********

the atomic number or nuclear charge number ( symbol z ) of a chemical element is the charge number of an atomic nucleus . for ordinary nuclei , this is equal to the proton number ( np ) or the number of protons found in the nucleus for every atom of that element . the atomic number can be used to uniquely identify ordinary chemical elements . in an ordinary uncharged atom , the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for an ordinary atom , the sum of the atomic number z and the neutron number n gives the atomic mass number a for the atom . since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass ( and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes ) and the mass defect of the nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass , the atomic mass of any atom , when expressed in unified atomic mass units ( making a quantity called the " relative isotopic mass " ) , is within 1 of the whole number uvmr_ev_paragraph_break atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers , and hence different mass numbers , are known as isotopes . a little more than three - quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes ( see monoisotopic elements ) , and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element ( called the relative atomic mass ) in a defined environment on earth , determines the elements standard atomic weight . historically , it was these atomic weights of elements ( in comparison to hydrogen ) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the conventional symbol z comes from the german word zahl ' number ' , which , before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics , merely denoted an elements numerical place in the periodic table , whose order was then approximately , but not completely , consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights . only after 1915 , with the suggestion and evidence that this z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms , did the word atomzahl ( and its english equivalent atomic number ) come into common use in this context . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break loosely speaking , the existence or construction of a periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements , and so they can be numbered in order . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break dmitri mendeleev claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables ( first published on march 6 , 1869 ) in order of atomic weight ( " atomgewicht " ) . however , in consideration of the elements ' observed chemical properties , he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium ( atomic weight 127 ) ahead of iodine ( atomic weight 126 ) . this placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number , z , but that number was not known or suspected at the time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory , however . besides the case of iodine and tellurium , later several other pairs of elements ( such as argon and potassium , cobalt and nickel ) were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights , thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties . however the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar lanthanide elements , whose atomic number was not obvious , led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from lutetium ( element 71 ) onward ( hafnium was not known at this time ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1911 , ernest rutherford gave a model of the atom in which a central nucleus held most of the atoms mass and a positive charge which , in units of the electrons charge , was to be approximately equal to half of the atoms atomic weight , expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms this central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight ( though it was almost 25 different from the atomic number of gold , ) , the single element from which rutherford made his guess ) . nevertheless , in spite of rutherfords estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 ( but was element on the periodic table ) , a month after rutherfords paper appeared , antonius van den broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was exactly equal to its place in the periodic table ( also known as element number , atomic number , and symbolized z ) . this proved eventually to be the case . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the experimental position improved dramatically after research by henry moseley in 1913 . moseley , after discussions with bohr who was at the same lab ( and who had used van den broeks hypothesis in his bohr model of the atom ) , decided to test van den broeks and bohrs hypothesis directly , by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the bohr theorys postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to do this , moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions ( k and l lines ) produced by the elements from aluminum ( z13 ) to gold ( z79 ) used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an x - ray tube . the square root of the frequency of these photons increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression . this led to the conclusion ( moseleys law ) that the atomic number does closely correspond ( with an offset of one unit for k - lines , in moseleys work ) to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus , that is the element number among other things , moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series ( from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive ) must have 15 members—no fewer and no more—which was far from obvious from known chemistry at that time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after moseleys death in 1915 , the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium ( z92 ) were examined by his method . there were seven elements ( with zlt ; 92 ) which were not found and therefore identified as still undiscovered , corresponding to atomic numbers 43 , 61 , 72 , 75 , 85 , 87 and 91 . from 1918 to 1947 , all seven of these missing elements were discovered . by this time , the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered , so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium ( z96 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1915 , the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of z , which were now recognized to be the same as the element number , was not understood . an old idea called prouts hypothesis had postulated that the elements were all made of residues ( or " protyles " ) of the lightest element hydrogen , which in the bohr - rutherford model had a single electron and a nuclear charge of one . however , as early as 1907 , rutherford and thomas royds had shown that alpha particles , which had a charge of 2 , were the nuclei of helium atoms , which had a mass four times that of hydrogen , not two times . if prouts hypothesis were true , something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1917 , rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a nuclear reaction between alpha particles and nitrogen gas , and believed he had proven prouts law . he called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in 1920 ( alternate names being proutons and protyles ) . it had been immediately apparent from the work of moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of hydrogen nuclei , and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra protons presumed present in all heavy nuclei . a helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two " nuclear electrons " ( electrons bound inside the nucleus ) to cancel two of the charges . at the other end of the periodic table , a nucleus of gold with a mass 197 times that of hydrogen was thought to contain 118nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it a residual charge of 79 , consistent with its atomic number . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all consideration of nuclear electrons ended with james chadwicks discovery of the neutron in 1932 . an atom of gold now was seen as containing 118 neutrons rather than 118 nuclear electrons , and its positive nuclear charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of 79protons . since moseley had previously shown that the atomic number z of an element equals this positive charge , it was now clear that z is identical to the number of protons of its nuclei . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom , which is z ( the atomic number ) . the configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics . the number of electrons in each elements electron shells , particularly the outermost valence shell , is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior . hence , it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element ; and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of any mixture of atoms with a given atomic number . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers . as of , all elements with atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been observed . synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions , such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created . in general , the half - life of a nuclide becomes shorter as atomic number increases , though undiscovered nuclides with certain " magic " numbers of protons and neutrons may have relatively longer half - lives and comprise an island of stability . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a hypothetical element composed only of neutrons has also been proposed and would have atomic number 0 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 64: Anatomy ***********

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anatomy ( is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their parts . anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things . it is an old science , having its beginnings in prehistoric times . anatomy is inherently tied to developmental biology , embryology , comparative anatomy , evolutionary biology , and phylogeny , as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated , both over immediate and long - term timescales . anatomy and physiology , which study the structure and function of organisms and their parts respectively , make a natural pair of related disciplines , and are often studied together . human anatomy is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied in medicine . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic and microscopic . macroscopic anatomy , or gross anatomy , is the examination of an animals body parts using unaided eyesight . gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy . microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures , known as histology , and also in the study of cells . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body . methods have also improved dramatically , advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers ( corpses ) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including x - ray , ultrasound , and magnetic resonance imaging . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break derived from the greek ἀνατομή anatomē " dissection " ( from ἀνατέμνω anatémnō " i cut up , cut open " from ἀνά aná " up " , and τέμνω témnō " i cut " ) , anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems , organs and tissues . it includes the appearance and position of the various parts , the materials from which they are composed , their locations and their relationships with other parts . anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry , which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved . for example , an anatomist is concerned with the shape , size , position , structure , blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver ; while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile , the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or macroscopic anatomy and microscopic anatomy . gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye , and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy , the study by sight of the external body features . microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale , along with histology ( the study of tissues ) , and embryology ( the study of an organism in its immature condition ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anatomy can be studied using both invasive and non - invasive methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term " anatomy " is commonly taken to refer to human anatomy . however , substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals . the term zootomy is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non - human animals . the structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the kingdom animalia contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motile ( although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle ) . most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans . they have an internal digestive chamber , with one or two openings ; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs , and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development . metazoans do not include the sponges , which have undifferentiated cells . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unlike plant cells , animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts . vacuoles , when present , are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell . the body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell , including those found in muscles , nerves and skin . each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids , cytoplasm and a nucleus . all of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers . those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic . all of a triploblastic animals tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo , the ectoderm , mesoderm and endoderm . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types : connective , epithelial , muscle and nervous tissue . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix . connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place . the main types are loose connective tissue , adipose tissue , fibrous connective tissue , cartilage and bone . the extracellular matrix contains proteins , the chief and most abundant of which is collagen . collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues . the matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body . an exoskeleton is a thickened , rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization , as in crustaceans or by the cross - linking of its proteins as in insects . an endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals , as well as in many of those less developed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells , bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules , with little intercellular space . epithelial cells can be squamous ( flat ) , cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina , the upper layer of the basement membrane , the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells . there are many different types of epithelium , modified to suit a particular function . in the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining ; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi . skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body . keratinocytes make up to 95 of the cells in the skin . the epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle . in simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break muscle cells ( myocytes ) form the active contractile tissue of the body . muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion , either locomotion or movement within internal organs . muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types ; smooth muscle , skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle . smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically . it contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths . it is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers . skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension . it is found in the movement of appendages and jaws . obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two . the filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions . in higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets . smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus , bladder , intestines , stomach , oesophagus , respiratory airways , and blood vessels . cardiac muscle is found only in the heart , allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information . in some slow - moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians ( including sea anemones and jellyfish ) , the nerves form a nerve net , but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles . in simple animals , receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus . in more complex animals , specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism . neurons can be connected together in ganglia . in higher animals , specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) and a peripheral nervous system . the latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs . the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle , and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle , certain glands and internal organs , including the stomach . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all vertebrates have a similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives , mostly in the embryonic stage , share the major chordate characteristics ; a stiffening rod , the notochord ; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material , the neural tube ; pharyngeal arches ; and a tail posterior to the anus . the spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it . nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm , connective tissues are derived from mesoderm , and gut is derived from the endoderm . at the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut . the mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal , and the anus at the base of the tail . the defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column , formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae . in most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs . however , a few vertebrates , such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood . jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages , fins or legs , which may be secondarily lost . the limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor . this is one of the arguments put forward by charles darwin to support his theory of evolution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the body of a fish is divided into a head , trunk and tail , although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible . the skeleton , which forms the support structure inside the fish , is either made of cartilage , in cartilaginous fish , or bone in bony fish . the main skeletal element is the vertebral column , composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong . the ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles . the main external features of the fish , the fins , are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays , which with the exception of the caudal fins , have no direct connection with the spine . they are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk . the eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision . there is an inner ear but no external or middle ear . low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish , and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sharks and rays are basal fish with numerous primitive anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish , including skeletons composed of cartilage . their bodies tend to be dorso - ventrally flattened , they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head . the dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales . they have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open , but not a swim bladder . cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large , yolky eggs . some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the bony fish lineage shows more derived anatomical traits , often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish . they have a bony skeleton , are generally laterally flattened , have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum , and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout . the dermis is covered with overlapping scales . bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column , but not a cloaca . they mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amphibians are a class of animals comprising frogs , salamanders and caecilians . they are tetrapods , but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size . their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes . their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae . their skulls are mostly broad and short , and are often incompletely ossified . their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales , but contains many mucous glands and in some species , poison glands . the hearts of amphibians have three chambers , two atria and one ventricle . they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea . amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping , a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils . these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat . they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs . the feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing . frogs have large eyes and no tail . salamanders resemble lizards in appearance ; their short legs project sideways , the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail . caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless . they burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles , tuataras , lizards , snakes and crocodiles . they are tetrapods , but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size . their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians . the teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size . the surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer . reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls . the heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams the reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization , with a copulatory organ present in most species . the eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land , or develop internally in some species . the bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break turtles are notable for their protective shells . they have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below . these are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine . the neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell . turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp , horny plates . in aquatic species , the front legs are modified into flippers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the triassic period . there is one living species , sphenodon punctatus . the skull has two openings ( fenestrae ) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull . there is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews . the teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down . the brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles , and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi . the tuatara has a well - developed parietal eye on its forehead . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side , the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost . this results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider . lizards are mostly quadrupeds , with the trunk held off the ground by short , sideways - facing legs , but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes . lizards have moveable eyelids , eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break snakes are closely related to lizards , having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the cretaceous period , and they share many of the same features . the skeleton consists of a skull , a hyoid bone , spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs . the bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole . snakes lack moveable eyelids , the eyes being covered by transparent " spectacle " scales . they do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull . their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm - blooded prey . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break crocodilians are large , low - slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth . the head and trunk are dorso - ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed . it undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming . the tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull . the nostrils , eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating . valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged . unlike other reptiles , crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping , their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight . birds are endothermic , have a high metabolic rate , a light skeletal system and powerful muscles . the long bones are thin , hollow and very light . air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones . the sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused . there are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn - covered beak . the eyes are relatively large , particularly in nocturnal species such as owls . they face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin . large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail , contour feathers cover the birds surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds . the only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail . this produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens . there are scales on the legs , feet and claws on the tips of the toes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mammals are a diverse class of animals , mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight . they mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings . the legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk , which is held well clear of the ground . the bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth , which are usually differentiated , are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel . the teeth are shed once ( milk teeth ) during the animals lifetime or not at all , as is the case in cetaceans . mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear . they are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat . some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands , producing milk to feed the young . mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs . the mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate . nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mammals are amniotes , and most are viviparous , giving birth to live young . the exception to this are the egg - laying monotremes , the platypus and the echidnas of australia . most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment , but in marsupials , the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mothers pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break humans have the overall body plan of a mammal . humans have a head , neck , trunk ( which includes the thorax and abdomen ) , two arms and hands , and two legs and feet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break generally , students of certain biological sciences , paramedics , prosthetists and orthotists , physiotherapists , occupational therapists , nurses , podiatrists , and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models , skeletons , textbooks , diagrams , photographs , lectures and tutorials and in addition , medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers . the study of microscopic anatomy ( or histology ) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations ( or slides ) under a microscope . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break human anatomy , physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences , which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school . human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically ; that is , respectively , studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest , or studying by specific systems , such as the nervous or respiratory systems a thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians , especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties , such as histopathology and radiology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break academic anatomists are usually employed by universities , medical schools or teaching hospitals . they are often involved in teaching anatomy , and research into certain systems , organs , tissues or cells . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus , lobster and dragonfly . they constitute about 95 of the animal species . by definition , none of these creatures has a backbone . the cells of single - cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs . locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia , food may be gathered by phagocytosis , energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton . some protozoans can form multicellular colonies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break metazoans are a multicellular organism , with different groups of cells serving different functions . the most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue , both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates . the outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism . an endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms , sponges and some cephalopods . exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods ( insects , spiders , ticks , shrimps , crabs , lobsters ) . calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs , brachiopods and some tube - building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria . other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges , the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians ( polyps , sea anemones , jellyfish ) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids . the outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells , gland cells and stinging cells . there may also be protrusions such as microvilli , cilia , bristles , spines and tubercles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break marcello malpighi , the father of microscopical anatomy , discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm . he observed that when a ring - like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring , and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves , and being captured above the ring . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arthropods comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate species . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break insects possess segmented bodies supported by a hard - jointed outer covering , the exoskeleton , made mostly of chitin . the segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts , a head , a thorax and an abdomen . the head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae , a pair of compound eyes , one to three simple eyes ( ocelli ) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts . the thorax has three pairs of segmented legs , one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings . the abdomen is composed of eleven segments , some of which may be fused and houses the digestive , respiratory , excretory and reproductive systems there is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts , especially wings , legs , antennae and mouthparts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break spiders a class of arachnids have four pairs of legs ; a body of two segments—a cephalothorax and an abdomen . spiders have no wings and no antennae . they have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous . they have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax . these have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs . at the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon - shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1600 bce , the edwin smith papyrus , an ancient egyptian medical text , described the heart , its vessels , liver , spleen , kidneys , hypothalamus , uterus and bladder , and showed the blood vessels diverging from the heart . the ebers papyrus ( c . 1550 bce ) features a " treatise on the heart " , with vessels carrying all the bodys fluids to or from every member of the body . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ancient greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world . over time , this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body . phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made , which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain , eye , liver , reproductive organs and the nervous system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the hellenistic egyptian city of alexandria was the stepping - stone for greek anatomy and physiology . alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the greeks , but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers . great patronage of the arts and sciences from the ptolemy rulers helped raise alexandria up , further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other greek states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in hellenistic alexandria . herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine . some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse , the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls than veins , and that the atria were parts of the heart . herophiluss knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain , eye , liver , reproductive organs and nervous system , and characterizing the course of disease . erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain , including the cavities and membranes , and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum during his study in alexandria , erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems he was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart , which was then carried throughout the body . his distinction between the arteries and veins—the arteries carrying the air through the body , while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery . erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart , including the tricuspid . during the third century , greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses . herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain , appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the " seat of intellect " and not a " cooling chamber " as propounded by aristotle herophilus is also credited with describing the optic , oculomotor , motor division of the trigeminal , facial , vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break great feats were made during the third century bce in both the digestive and reproductive systems herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands , but the small intestine and liver . he showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes . he recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the hippocratic corpus , an ancient greek medical work written by unknown authors . aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection . praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins . also in the 4th century bce , herophilos and erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in alexandria during the ptolemaic dynasty . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 2nd century , galen of pergamum , an anatomist , clinician , writer and philosopher , he compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals . he was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals . galens drawings , based mostly on dog anatomy , became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years . his work was known to renaissance doctors only through islamic golden age medicine until it was translated from the greek some time in the 15th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth century ; as the historian marie boas writes , " progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after 1500 is startlingly rapid " . between 1275 and 1326 , the anatomists mondino de luzzi , alessandro achillini and antonio benivieni at bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times . mondinos anatomy of 1316 was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy . it describes the body in the order followed in mondinos dissections , starting with the abdomen , then the thorax , then the head and limbs . it was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break leonardo da vinci ( 1452–1519 ) was trained in anatomy by andrea del verrocchio . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break andreas vesalius ( 1514–1564 ) , professor of anatomy at the university of padua , is considered the founder of modern human anatomy . originally from brabant , vesalius published the influential book de humani corporis fabrica ( " the structure of the human body " ) , a large format book in seven volumes , in 1543 . the accurate and intricately detailed illustrations , often in allegorical poses against italianate landscapes , are thought to have been made by the artist jan van calcar , a pupil of titian . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in england , anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any science ; these were given by the company of barbers and surgeons in the 16th century , joined in 1583 by the lumleian lectures in surgery at the royal college of physicians . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the united states , medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the 18th century . classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain . philadelphia , baltimore and new york were all renowned for body snatching activity as criminals raided graveyards at night , removing newly buried corpses from their coffins . a similar problem existed in britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave - raiding and even anatomy murder were practised to obtain cadavers . some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers . the practice was halted in britain by the anatomy act of 1832 , while in the united states , similar legislation was enacted after the physician william forbes of jefferson medical college was found guilty in 1882 of " complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in lebanon cemetery " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the teaching of anatomy in britain was transformed by sir john struthers , regius professor of anatomy at the university of aberdeen from 1863 to 1889 . he was responsible for setting up the system of three years of " pre - clinical " academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine , including especially anatomy . this system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003 . as well as teaching , he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy , published over 70 research papers , and became famous for his public dissection of the tay whale . from 1822 the royal college of surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools . medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy , and were often used in teaching . ignaz semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused . he noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives . the students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth . semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination , the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before the modern medical era , the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were dissection of the dead and inspection , palpation and auscultation of the living . it was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues . technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839 , matthias jakob schleiden and theodor schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things . study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine . staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue . advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens . the invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them . about the same time , in the 1950s , the use of x - ray diffraction for studying the crystal structures of proteins , nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break equally important advances have occurred in non - invasive techniques for examining the interior structures of the body . x - rays can be passed through the body and used in medical radiography and fluoroscopy to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness . magnetic resonance imaging , computed tomography , and ultrasound imaging have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 65: Affirming the consequent ***********

affirming the consequent , sometimes called converse error , fallacy of the converse , or confusion of necessity and sufficiency , is a formal fallacy of taking a true conditional statement ( for example , " if the lamp were broken , then the room would be dark " ) , and invalidly inferring its converse ( " the room is dark , so the lamp is broken " ) , even though that statement may not be true . this arises when a consequent ( " the room would be dark " ) has other possible antecedents seen as less likely ( for example , " the lamp is not plugged in " or " the lamp is in working order , but is switched off " ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break converse errors are common in everyday thinking and communication and can result from , among other causes , communication issues , misconceptions about logic , and failure to consider other causes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the opposite statement , denying the consequent , is a valid form of argument . denying the consequent can be considered a form of abductive reasoning . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break affirming the consequent is the action of taking a true statement p to q and invalidly concluding its converse q to the name affirming the consequent derives from using the consequent , q , of p to q , to conclude the antecedent this illogic can be summarized formally as ( p to q , q ) to p or , alternatively , fracp to q , qtherefore uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the root cause of such a logic error is sometimes failure to realize that just because p is a possible condition for q , p may not be the only condition for q , that is q may follow from another condition as well . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break affirming the consequent can also result from overgeneralizing the experience of many statements having true converses . if p and q are " equivalent " statements , that is p leftrightarrow q , it is possible to infer p under the condition for example , the statements " it is august 13 , so it is my birthday " p to q and " it is my birthday , so it is august 13 " q to p are equivalent and both true consequences of the statement " august 13 is my birthday " ( an abbreviated form of p leftrightarrow q ) . using one statement to conclude the other is not an example of affirming the consequent , but some people may misapply the approach . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break example 1 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion . for example : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are many ways to live in california without living in san diego , as long as they live in a californian place other than san diego . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however , one can affirm with certainty that " if someone does not live in california " ( non - q ) , then " this person does not live in san diego " ( non - p ) . this is the contrapositive of the first statement , and it must be true if and only if the original statement is true . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break example 2 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break here is another useful , obviously - fallacious example . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break here , it is immediately intuitive that any number of other antecedents ( " if an animal is a deer " , " if an animal is an elephant " , " if an animal is a moose " , etcetera ) can give rise to the consequent ( " then it has four legs " ) , and that it is preposterous to suppose that having four legs must imply that the animal is a dog and nothing else . this is useful as a teaching example since most people can immediately recognize that the conclusion reached must be wrong ( intuitively , a cat cannot be a dog ) , and that the method by which it was reached must therefore be fallacious . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break example 3 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing , as in the following example : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break being thrown off the top of the eiffel tower is not the only cause of death , since there exist numerous different causes of death . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break affirming the consequent is commonly used in rationalization , and thus appears as a coping mechanism in some people . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break example 4 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in catch - 22 , the chaplain is interrogated for supposedly being " washington irving " / " irving washington " , who has been blocking out large portions of soldiers ' letters home . the colonel has found such a letter , but with the chaplains name signed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break p in this case is ' the chaplain signs his own name ' , and q ' the chaplains name is written ' . the chaplains name may be written , but he did not necessarily write it , as the colonel falsely concludes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

day kadyysky district of the kostroma oblast , russia ) to the poet and translator arseny aleksandrovich tarkovsky , a native of kropyvnytskyi , ukraine , and maria ivanova vishnyakova , a graduate of the maxim gorky literature institute who later worked as a corrector ; she was born in moscow in the dubasov family estate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break andreis paternal grandfather aleksandr karlovich tarkovsky ( in ) was a polish nobleman who worked as a bank clerk . his wife maria danilovna rachkovskaya was a romanian teacher who arrived from iași . andreis maternal grandmother vera nikolaevna vishnyakova ( née dubasova ) belonged to an old dubasov family of russian nobility that traces its history back to the 17th century ; among her relatives was admiral fyodor dubasov , a fact she had to conceal during the soviet days . she was married to ivan ivanovich vishnyakov , a native of the kaluga governorate who studied law at the moscow state university and served as a judge in kozelsk . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to the family legend , tarkovskys ancestors on his fathers side were princes from the shamkhalate of tarki , dagestan , although his sister marina tarkovskaya who did a detailed research on their genealogy called it " a myth , even a prank of sorts , " stressing that none of the documents confirms this version . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky spent his childhood in yuryevets . he was described by childhood friends as active and popular , having many friends and being typically in the center of action . his father left the family in 1937 , subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941 . he returned home in 1943 , having been awarded a red star after being shot in one of his legs ( which he would eventually need to amputate due to gangrene ) . tarkovsky stayed with his mother , moving with her and his sister marina to moscow , where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1939 , tarkovsky enrolled at the moscow school no . during the war , the three evacuated to yuryevets , living with his maternal grandmother . in 1943 , the family returned to moscow . tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school , where the poet andrei voznesensky was one of his classmates . he studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school . the family lived on shchipok street in the zamoskvorechye district in moscow . from november 1947 to spring 1948 he was in the hospital with tuberculosis . many themes of his childhood—the evacuation , his mother and her two children , the withdrawn father , the time in the hospital—feature prominently in his film mirror . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his school years , tarkovsky was a troublemaker and a poor student . he still managed to graduate , and from 1951 to 1952 studied arabic at the oriental institute in moscow , a branch of the academy of sciences of the soviet union . although he already spoke some arabic and was a successful student in his first semesters , he did not finish his studies and dropped out to work as a prospector for the academy of science institute for non - ferrous metals and gold . he participated in a year - long research expedition to the river kureyka near turukhansk in the krasnoyarsk province . during this time in the taiga , tarkovsky decided to study film . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break upon returning from the research expedition in 1954 , tarkovsky applied at the state institute of cinematography ( vgik ) and was admitted to the film - directing program . he was in the same class as irma raush ( irina ) whom he married in april 1957 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the early khrushchev era offered good opportunities for young film directors . before 1953 , annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors . after 1953 , more films were produced , many of them by young directors . the khrushchev thaw relaxed soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of european and north american literature , films and music . this allowed tarkovsky to see films of the italian neorealists , french new wave , and of directors such as kurosawa , buñuel , bergman , bresson , wajda ( whose film ashes and diamonds influenced tarkovsky ) and mizoguchi . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovskys teacher and mentor was mikhail romm , who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors . in 1956 , tarkovsky directed his first student short film , the killers , from a short story of ernest hemingway . the longer television film there will be no leave today followed in 1959 . both films were a collaboration between the vgik students . classmate aleksandr gordon , who married tarkovskys sister , in particular directed , wrote , edited , and acted in the two films with tarkovsky . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an important influence on tarkovsky was the film director grigory chukhray , who was teaching at the vgik . impressed by the talent of his student , chukhray offered tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film clear skies . tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during his third year at the vgik , tarkovsky met andrei konchalovsky . they found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films in 1959 , they wrote the script antarctica – distant country , which was later published in the moskovsky komsomolets . tarkovsky submitted the script to lenfilm , but it was rejected . they were more successful with the script the steamroller and the violin , which they sold to mosfilm . this became tarkovskys graduation project , earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning first prize at the new york student film festival in 1961 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovskys first feature film was ivans childhood in 1962 . he had inherited the film from director eduard abalov , who had to abort the project . the film earned tarkovsky international acclaim and won the golden lion award at the venice film festival in the year 1962 . in the same year , on 30 september , his first son arseny ( called senka in tarkovskys diaries ) tarkovsky was born . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1965 , he directed the film andrei rublev about the life of andrei rublev , the fifteenth - century russian icon painter . andrei rublev was not , except for a single screening in moscow in 1966 , immediately released after completion due to problems with soviet authorities . tarkovsky had to cut the film several times , resulting in several different versions of varying lengths . the film was widely released in the soviet union in a cut version in 1971 . nevertheless , the film had a budget of more than 1 million rubles – a significant sum for that period . a version of the film was presented at the cannes film festival in 1969 and won the fipresci prize . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he divorced his wife , irina , in june 1970 . in the same year , he married larisa kizilova ( née egorkina ) , who had been a production assistant for the film andrei rublev ( they had been living together since 1965 ) . their son , andrei andreyevich tarkovsky , ( nicknamed andriosha , meaning " little andre " or " andre junior " ) was born in the same year on 7 august . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1972 , he completed solaris , an adaptation of the novel solaris by stanisław lem . he had worked on this together with screenwriter friedrich gorenstein as early as 1968 . the film was presented at the cannes film festival , won the grand prix spécial du jury , and was nominated for the palme dor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 1973 to 1974 , he shot the film mirror , a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his fathers poems in this film tarkovsky portrayed the plight of childhood affected by war . tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967 , under the consecutive titles confession , white day and a white , white day . from the beginning the film was not well received by soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature . soviet authorities placed the film in the " third category " , a severely limited distribution , and only allowed it to be shown in third - class cinemas and workers ' clubs . few prints were made and the film - makers received no returns . third category films also placed the film - makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds , which could have serious effects on their future productivity . these difficulties are presumed to have made tarkovsky play with the idea of going abroad and producing a film outside the soviet film industry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during 1975 , tarkovsky also worked on the screenplay hoffmanniana , about the german writer and poet hoffmann . in december 1976 , he directed hamlet , his only stage play , at the lenkom theatre in moscow . the main role was played by anatoly solonitsyn , who also acted in several of tarkovskys films at the end of 1978 , he also wrote the screenplay sardor together with the writer aleksandr misharin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the last film tarkovsky completed in the soviet union was stalker , inspired by the novel roadside picnic by the brothers arkady and boris strugatsky . tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986 . initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel dead mountaineers hotel and he developed a raw script . influenced by a discussion with arkady strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on roadside picnic . work on this film began in 1976 . the production was mired in troubles ; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots . tarkovskys relationship with cinematographer georgy rerberg deteriorated to the point where he hired alexander knyazhinsky as a new first cinematographer . furthermore , tarkovsky had a heart attack in april 1978 , resulting in further delay . the film was completed in 1979 and won the prize of the ecumenical jury at the cannes film festival . in a question and answer session at the edinburgh filmhouse on 11 february 1981 , tarkovsky trenchantly rejected suggestions that the film was either impenetrably mysterious or a political allegory . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1979 , tarkovsky began production of the film the first day ( russian : первый день pervyj dyen ) , based on a script by his friend and long - term collaborator andrei konchalovsky . the film was set in 18th - century russia during the reign of peter the great and starred natalya bondarchuk and anatoli papanov . to get the project approved by goskino , tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script , omitting several scenes that were critical of the official atheism in the soviet union . after shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors . tarkovsky was reportedly infuriated by this interruption and destroyed most of the film . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the summer of 1979 , tarkovsky traveled to italy , where he shot the documentary voyage in time together with his long - time friend tonino guerra . tarkovsky returned to italy in 1980 for an extended trip , during which he and guerra completed the script for the film nostalghia . during this period , he took polaroid photographs depicting his personal life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky returned to italy in 1982 to start shooting nostalghia , but mosfilm then withdrew from the project , so he sought and received financial backing from the italian rai . tarkovsky completed the film in 1983 , and it was presented at the cannes film festival where it won the fipresci prize and the prize of the ecumenical jury . tarkovsky also shared a special prize called grand prix du cinéma de creation with robert bresson . soviet authorities lobbied to prevent the film from winning the palme dor , a fact that hardened tarkovskys resolve to never work in the soviet union again . after cannes he went to london to stage and choreograph the opera boris godunov at the royal opera house under the musical direction of claudio abbado . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at a press conference in milan on 10 july 1984 , he announced that he would never return to the soviet union and would remain in western europe . he stated , " i am not a soviet dissident , i have no conflict with the soviet government , " but if he returned home , he added , " i would be unemployed . " at that time , his son andriosha was still in the soviet union and not allowed to leave the country . on 28 august 1985 , tarkovsky was processed as a soviet defector at a refugee camp in latina , italy , registered with the serial number 13225 / 379 , and officially welcomed to the west . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky spent most of 1984 preparing the film the sacrifice . it was finally shot in 1985 in sweden , with many of the crew being alumni from ingmar bergmans films , including cinematographer sven nykvist . tarkovskys vision of his film was greatly influenced by bergmans style . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while the sacrifice is about an apocalypse and impending death , faith , and possible redemption , in the making - of documentary directed by andrei tarkovsky , in a particularly poignant scene , writer / director michal leszczylowski follows tarkovsky on a walk as he expresses his sentiments on death—he claims himself to be immortal and has no fear of dying . ironically , at the end of the year tarkovsky was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer . in january 1986 , he began treatment in paris and was joined there by his son , andre jr , who was finally allowed to leave the soviet union . what would be tarkovskys final film was dedicated to him . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the sacrifice was presented at the cannes film festival and received the grand prix spécial du jury , the fipresci prize and the prize of the ecumenical jury . as tarkovsky was unable to attend due to his illness , the prizes were collected by his son . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in tarkovskys last diary entry ( 15 december 1986 ) , he wrote : " but now i have no strength left—that is the problem " . the diaries are sometimes also known as martyrology and were published posthumously in 1989 and in english in 1991 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky died in paris on 29 december 1986 . his funeral ceremony was held at the alexander nevsky cathedral . he was buried on 3 january 1987 in the russian cemetery in sainte - geneviève - des - bois in france . the inscription on his gravestone , which was erected in 1994 , was conceived by tarkovskys wife , larisa , reads : to the man who saw the angel . larisa died in 1998 and is buried beside her husband . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a conspiracy theory emerged in russia in the early 1990s when it was alleged that tarkovsky did not die of natural causes , but was assassinated by the kgb . evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former kgb agents who claim that viktor chebrikov gave the order to eradicate tarkovsky to curtail what the soviet government and the kgb saw as anti - soviet propaganda by tarkovsky . other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the 1991 coup and the claim by one of tarkovskys doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as with tarkovsky , his wife larisa and actor anatoly solonitsyn all died from the very same type of lung cancer . vladimir sharun , sound designer in stalker , is convinced that they were all poisoned by the chemical plant where they were shooting the film . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s , a period referred to as the khrushchev thaw , during which soviet society opened to foreign films , literature and music , among other things . this allowed tarkovsky to see films of european , american and japanese directors , an experience that influenced his own film making . his teacher and mentor at the film school , mikhail romm , allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky was , according to fellow student shavkat abdusalmov , fascinated by japanese films he was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight . tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of haiku and its ability to create " images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky was also a deeply religious orthodox christian , who believed great art should have a higher spiritual purpose . he was a perfectionist not given to humor or humility : his signature style was ponderous and literary , having many characters that pondered over religious themes and issues regarding faith . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky perceived that the art of cinema has only been truly mastered by very few filmmakers , stating in a 1970 interview with naum abramov that " they can be counted on the fingers of one hand " . in 1972 , tarkovsky told film historian leonid kozlov his ten favorite films the list includes : diary of a country priest and mouchette by robert bresson ; winter light , wild strawberries , and persona by ingmar bergman ; nazarín by luis buñuel ; city lights by charlie chaplin ; ugetsu by kenji mizoguchi ; seven samurai by akira kurosawa , and woman in the dunes by hiroshi teshigahara . among his favorite directors were buñuel , mizoguchi , bergman , bresson , kurosawa , michelangelo antonioni , jean vigo , and carl theodor dreyer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the exception of city lights , the list does not contain any films of the early silent era . the reason is that tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon , with the early film - making forming only a prelude . the list has also no films or directors from tarkovskys native russia , although he rated soviet directors such as boris barnet , sergei parajanov and alexander dovzhenko highly . he said of dovzhenkos earth : " i have lived a lot among very simple farmers and met extraordinary people . they spread calmness , had such tact , they conveyed a feeling of dignity and displayed wisdom that i have seldom come across on such a scale . dovzhenko had obviously understood wherein the sense of life resides . this trespassing of the border between nature and mankind is an ideal place for the existence of man . dovzhenko understood this . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break andrei tarkovsky was not a fan of science fiction , largely dismissing it for its " comic book " trappings and vulgar commercialism . however , in a famous exception tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film the terminator , saying that its " vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art " . he was critical of the " brutality and low acting skills " , but was nevertheless impressed by the film . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a 1962 interview , tarkovsky argued : " all art , of course , is intellectual , but for me , all the arts , and cinema even more so , must above all be emotional and act upon the heart . " his films are characterized by metaphysical themes , extremely long takes , and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty . recurring motifs are dreams , memory , childhood , running water accompanied by fire , rain indoors , reflections , levitation , and characters re - appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera . he once said : " juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless , collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away , relating a person to the whole world , that is the meaning of cinema . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky incorporated levitation scenes into several of his films , most notably solaris . to him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability . water , clouds , and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value , as well as their symbolism , such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water . bells and candles are also frequent symbols . these are symbols of film , sight and sound , and tarkovskys film frequently has themes of self - reflection . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called " sculpting in time " . by this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it . unedited movie footage transcribes time in real time . by using long takes and few cuts in his films , he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing , time lost , and the relationship of one moment in time to another . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break up to , and including , his film mirror , tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory . after mirror , he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the dramatic unities proposed by aristotle : a concentrated action , happening in one place , within the span of a single day . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several of tarkovskys films have color or black - and - white sequences . this first occurs in the otherwise monochrome andrei rublev , which features a color epilogue of rublevs authentic religious icon paintings . all of his films afterwards contain monochrome , and in stalkers case sepia sequences , while otherwise being in color . in 1966 , in an interview conducted shortly after finishing andrei rublev , tarkovsky dismissed color film as a " commercial gimmick " and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color . he claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time , and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments , but not all the time , as this distracts the viewer . to him , films in color were like moving paintings or photographs , which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ingmar bergman , a renowned director , commented on tarkovsky : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break contrarily , however , bergman conceded the truth in the claim made by a critic who wrote that " with autumn sonata bergman does bergman " , adding : " tarkovsky began to make tarkovsky films , and that fellini began to make fellini films buñuel nearly always made buñuel films " this pastiche of ones own work has been derogatorily termed as " self - karaoke " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer vadim yusov from 1958 to 1972 , and much of the visual style of tarkovskys films can be attributed to this collaboration . tarkovsky would spend two days preparing for yusov to film a single long take , and due to the preparation , usually only a single take was needed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his last film , the sacrifice , tarkovsky worked with cinematographer sven nykvist , who had worked on many films with director ingmar bergman . ( nykvist was not alone : several people involved in the production had previously collaborated with bergman , notably lead actor erland josephson , who had also acted for tarkovsky in nostalghia . nykvist complained that tarkovsky would frequently look through the camera and even direct actors through it , but ultimately stated that choosing to work with tarkovsky was one of the best choices he had ever made . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky is mainly known as a film director . during his career he directed seven feature films , as well as three shorts from his time at vgik . his features are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he also wrote several screenplays . furthermore , he directed the play hamlet for the stage in moscow , directed the opera boris godunov in london , and he directed a radio production of the short story turnabout by william faulkner . he also wrote sculpting in time , a book on film theory . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovskys first feature film was ivans childhood in 1962 . he then directed andrei rublev in 1966 , solaris in 1972 , mirror in 1975 and stalker in 1979 . the documentary voyage in time was produced in italy in 1982 , as was nostalghia in 1983 . his last film the sacrifice was produced in sweden in 1986 . tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films , sometimes with a cowriter . tarkovsky once said that a director who realizes somebody elses screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator , resulting in dead and monotonous films uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a book of 60 photos , instant light , tarkovsky polaroids , taken by tarkovsky in russia and italy between 1979 and 1984 was published in 2006 . the collection was selected by italian photographer giovanni chiaramonte and tarkovskys son andrey tarkovsky . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break concentrate ( концентрат , kontsentrat ) is a never - filmed 1958 screenplay by tarkovsky . the screenplay is based on tarkovskys year in the taiga as a member of a research expedition , prior to his enrollment in film school . its about the leader of a geological expedition , who waits for the boat that brings back the concentrates collected by the expedition . the expedition is surrounded by mystery , and its purpose is a state secret . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although some authors claim that the screenplay was filmed , according to marina tarkovskaya , tarkovskys sister ( and wife of aleksandr gordon , a fellow student of tarkovsky during his film school years ) the screenplay was never filmed . tarkovsky wrote the screenplay during his entrance examination at the state institute of cinematography ( vgik ) in a single sitting . he earned the highest possible grade , " excellent " ( отлично ) for this work . in 1994 , fragments of concentrate were filmed and used in the documentary andrei tarkovskys taiga summer by marina tarkovskaya and aleksandr gordon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hoffmanniana ( гофманиана ) is a never - filmed 1974 screenplay by tarkovsky . the screenplay is based on the life and work of german author hoffmann . in 1974 , an acquaintance from tallinnfilm approached tarkovsky to write a screenplay on a german theme . tarkovsky considered thomas mann and hoffmann , and also thought about ibsens peer gynt . in the end tarkovsky signed a contract for a script based on the life and work of hoffmann . he planned to write the script during the summer of 1974 at his dacha . writing was not without difficulty , less than a month before the deadline he had not written a single page . he finally finished the project in late 1974 and submitted the final script to tallinnfilm in october . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although the script was well received by the officials at tallinnfilm , it was the consensus that no one but tarkovsky would be able to direct it . the script was sent to goskino in february 1976 , and although approval was granted for proceeding with making the film , the screenplay was never realized . in 1984 , during the time of his exile in the west , tarkovsky revisited the screenplay and made a few changes . he also considered to finally direct a film based on the screenplay but ultimately dropped this idea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break numerous awards were bestowed on tarkovsky throughout his lifetime . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break under the influence of glasnost and perestroika , tarkovsky was finally recognized in the soviet union in the autumn of 1986 , shortly before his death , by a retrospective of his films in moscow . after his death , an entire issue of the film magazine iskusstvo kino was devoted to tarkovsky . in their obituaries , the film committee of the council of ministers of the soviet union and the union of soviet film makers expressed their sorrow that tarkovsky had to spend the last years of his life in exile . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break posthumously , he was awarded the lenin prize in 1990 , one of the highest state honors in the soviet union . in 1989 , the andrei tarkovsky memorial prize was established , with its first recipient being the russian animator yuri norstein . in three consecutive events , the moscow international film festival awarded the andrei tarkovsky award in 1993 , 1995 , and 1997 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1996 , the andrei tarkovsky museum opened in yuryevets , his childhood town . a minor planet , 3345 tarkovskij , discovered by soviet astronomer lyudmila karachkina in 1982 , has been named after him . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tarkovsky has been the subject of several documentaries . most notable is the 1988 documentary moscow elegy , by russian film director alexander sokurov . sokurovs own work has been heavily influenced by tarkovsky . the film consists mostly of narration over stock footage from tarkovskys films directed by andrei tarkovsky is a 1988 documentary film by michal leszczylowski , an editor of the film the sacrifice . film director chris marker produced the television documentary one day in the life of andrei arsenevich as an homage to andrei tarkovsky in 2000 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at the entrance to the gerasimov institute of cinematography in moscow , there is a monument that includes statues of tarkovsky , gennady shpalikov and vasily shukshin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break andrei tarkovsky and his works have received praise from many filmmakers , critics and thinkers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the swedish filmmaker ingmar bergman was quoted as saying : " tarkovsky for me is the greatest ' us ' , ' all ' , the one who invented a new language , true to the nature of film , as it captures life as a reflection , life as a dream " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the japanese filmmaker akira kurosawa remarked on tarkovskys films as saying : " his unusual sensitivity is both overwhelming and astounding . it almost reaches a pathological intensity . probably there is no equal among film directors alive now . " kurosawa also commented : " i love all of tarkovskys films i love his personality and all his works . every cut from his films is a marvelous image in itself . but the finished image is nothing more than the imperfect accomplishment of his idea . his ideas are only realized in part . and he had to make do with it .

*********** Article 67: Ambiguity ***********

ambiguity is a type of meaning in which a phrase , statement or resolution is not explicitly defined , making several interpretations plausible . a common aspect of ambiguity is uncertainty . it is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose intended meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps . ( the ambi - part of the term reflects an idea of " two " , as in " two meanings " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with vagueness . in ambiguity , specific and distinct interpretations are permitted ( although some may not be immediately obvious ) , whereas with information that is vague , it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity . the former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context - dependent interpretations . the latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations , none of which may have a standard agreed - upon meaning . this form of ambiguity is closely related to vagueness . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break linguistic ambiguity can be a problem in law , because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance . tructural analysis of an ambiguous spanish sentence : pepe vio a pablo enfurecidointerpretation 1 : when pepe was angry , then he saw pablointerpretation 2 : pepe saw that pablo was angry . ere , the syntactic tree in figure represents interpretation 2 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the lexical ambiguity of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs . " meaning " here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary . for instance , the word " bank " has several distinct lexical definitions , including " financial institution " and " edge of a river " . or consider " apothecary " . one could say " i bought herbs from the apothecary " . this could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary ( pharmacist ) or went to the apothecary ( pharmacy ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended . if , for instance , someone says " i buried 100 in the bank " , most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud . however , some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break lexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context , a task referred to as word - sense disambiguation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the use of multi - defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context , and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning ( in which case , a less ambiguous term should have been used ) . the goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver ( s ) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed . an exception to this could include a politician whose " weasel words " and obfuscation are necessary to gain support from multiple constituents with mutually exclusive conflicting desires from their candidate of choice . ambiguity is a powerful tool of political science . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break more problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts . " good " , for example , can mean " useful " or " functional " ( thats a good hammer ) , " exemplary " ( shes a good student ) , " pleasing " ( this is good soup ) , " moral " ( a good person versus the lesson to be learned from a story ) , " righteous " , etcetera " i have a good daughter " is not clear about which sense is intended . the various ways to apply prefixes and suffixes can also create ambiguity ( " unlockable " can mean " capable of being unlocked " or " impossible to lock " ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break semantic ambiguity occurs when a word , phrase or sentence , taken out of context , has more than one interpretation . in " we saw her duck " ( example due to richard nordquist ) , the words " her duck " can refer either uvmr_ev_paragraph_break syntactic ambiguity arises when a sentence can have two ( or more ) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence—its syntax . this is often due to a modifying expression , such as a prepositional phrase , the application of which is unclear . " he ate the cookies on the couch " , for example , could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch ( as opposed to those that were on the table ) , or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies . " to get in , you will need an entrance fee of 10 or your voucher and your drivers ' license . " this could mean that you need either ten dollars or both your voucher and your license . or it could mean that you need your license and you need either ten dollars or a voucher . only rewriting the sentence , or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for the notion of , and theoretic results about , syntactic ambiguity in artificial , formal languages ( such as computer programming languages ) , see ambiguous grammar . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break usually , semantic and syntactic ambiguity go hand in hand . the sentence " we saw her duck " is also syntactically ambiguous . conversely , a sentence like " he ate the cookies on the couch " is also semantically ambiguous . rarely , but occasionally , the different parsings of a syntactically ambiguous phrase result in the same meaning . for example , the command " cook , cook ! " can be parsed as " cook ( noun used as vocative ) , cook ( imperative verb form ) ! " , but also as " cook ( imperative verb form ) , cook ( noun used as vocative ) ! " . it is more common that a syntactically unambiguous phrase has a semantic ambiguity ; for example , the lexical ambiguity in " your boss is a funny man " is purely semantic , leading to the response " funny ha - ha or funny peculiar ? " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break spoken language can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities , where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words . for example , " ice cream " and " i scream " . such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context . a mishearing of such , based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity , is called a mondegreen . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break philosophers ( and other users of logic ) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing ( or intentionally adding ) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments . for example , a politician might say , " i oppose taxes which hinder economic growth " , an example of a glittering generality . some will think they oppose taxes in general because they hinder economic growth . others may think they oppose only those taxes that they believe will hinder economic growth . in writing , the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation , either by adding a comma after " taxes " ( to convey the first sense ) or by changing " which " to " that " ( to convey the second sense ) or by rewriting it in other ways . the devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way , and think the politician supports everyones opinion . however , the opposite can also be true—an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity ( intentionally or not ) . the logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in continental philosophy ( particularly phenomenology and existentialism ) , there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity , as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition . martin heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous , as is the relation of mind and body , and part and whole . in heideggers phenomenology , dasein is always in a meaningful world , but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification . thus , although some things may be certain , they have little to do with daseins sense of care and existential anxiety , for example , in the face of death . in calling his work being and nothingness an " essay in phenomenological ontology " jean - paul sartre follows heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous , or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity . simone de beauvoir tries to base an ethics on heideggers and sartres writings ( the ethics of ambiguity ) , where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity : " as long as there have been philosophers and they have thought , most of them have tried to mask it and the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples has always pursued the same goal . it has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality , by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it , by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment . " ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic , or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science . she states : " since we do not succeed in fleeing it , let us , therefore , try to look the truth in the face . let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity . it is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting " . other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life , nature , and sex are ambiguous . corey anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else : language , he asserts , divides what is not , in fact , separate . following ernest becker , he argues that the desire to ' authoritatively disambiguate ' the world and existence has led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide . on this basis , he argues that ethics must focus on ' dialectically integrating opposites ' and balancing tension , rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty . like the existentialists and phenomenologists , he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in literature and rhetoric , ambiguity can be a useful tool . groucho marxs classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor , for example : " last night i shot an elephant in my pajamas . how he got in my pajamas , ill never know " . songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect , as in the song title " dont it make my brown eyes blue " ( where " blue " can refer to the color , or to sadness ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the narrative , ambiguity can be introduced in several ways : motive , plot , character . scott fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel the great gatsby . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mathematical notation , widely used in physics and other sciences , avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language . however , for various reasons , several lexical , syntactic and semantic ambiguities remain . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ambiguity in the style of writing a function should not be confused with a multivalued function , which can ( and should ) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way . several special functions still do not have established notations . usually , the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value ; sometimes , the same name of the function is used , causing confusions . examples of such underestablished functions : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ambiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions . also , it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function , for example , ff ( x ) . then , if one sees ff ( y1 ) , there is no way to distinguish whether it means ff ( x ) multiplied by ( y1 ) , or function f evaluated at argument equal to ( y1 ) . in each case of use of such notations , the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break creators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities . many algorithmic languages ( c and fortran ) require the character as symbol of multiplication . the wolfram language used in mathematica allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol , but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function ; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions . fortran , in addition , does not allow use of the same name ( identifier ) for different objects , for example , function and variable ; in particular , the expression ff ( x ) is qualified as an error . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the order of operations may depend on the context . in most programming languages , the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right . until the last century , many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first , for example , a / bc is interpreted as a / ( bc ) ; in this case , the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language . in addition , it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis , which also may lead to ambiguity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the scientific journal style , one uses roman letters to denote elementary functions , whereas variables are written using italics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for example , in mathematical journals the expression uvmr_ev_paragraph_break does not denote the sine function , but the uvmr_ev_paragraph_break product of the three variables uvmr_ev_paragraph_break s , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break i , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break n , although in the informal notation of a slide presentation it may stand for sin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break commas in multi - component subscripts and superscripts are sometimes omitted ; this is also potentially ambiguous notation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for example , in the notation tmnk , the reader can only infer from the context whether it means a single - index object , taken with the subscript equal to product of variables m , n and k , or it is an indication to a trivalent tensor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an expression such as sin2alpha / 2 can be understood to mean either ( sin ( alpha / 2 ) ) 2 or ( sin alpha ) 2 / 2 . often the authors intention can be understood from the context , in cases where only one of the two makes sense , but an ambiguity like this should be avoided , for example by writing sin2 ( alpha / 2 ) or frac12sin2alpha . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the expression sin - 1alpha means arcsin ( alpha ) in several texts , though it might be thought to mean ( sin alpha ) - 1 , since sinn alpha commonly means ( sin alpha ) n . conversely , sin2 alpha might seem to mean sin ( sin alpha ) , as this exponentiation notation usually denotes function iteration : in general , f2 ( x ) means f ( f ( x ) ) . however , for trigonometric and hyperbolic functions , this notation conventionally means exponentiation of the result of function application . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the expression a / 2b can be interpreted as meaning ( a / 2 ) b ; however , it is more commonly understood to mean a / ( 2b ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is common to define the coherent states in quantum optics with alpharangle and states with fixed number of photons with nrangle . then , there is an " unwritten rule " : the state is coherent if there are more greek characters than latin characters in the argument , and nphoton state if the latin characters dominate . the ambiguity becomes even worse , if xrangle is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate , and prangle means the state with certain value of the momentum , which may be used in books on quantum mechanics . such ambiguities easily lead to confusions , especially if some normalized adimensional , dimensionless variables are used . expression 1rangle may mean a state with single photon , or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1 , or state with momentum equal to unity , and so on . the reader is supposed to guess from the context . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some physical quantities do not yet have established notations ; their value ( and sometimes even dimension , as in the case of the einstein coefficients ) , depends on the system of notations . many terms are ambiguous . each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition , suitable for a specific case . just like ludwig wittgenstein states in tractatus logico - philosophicus : " only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a highly confusing term is gain . for example , the sentence " the gain of a system should be doubled " , without context , means close to nothing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term intensity is ambiguous when applied to light . the term can refer to any of irradiance , luminous intensity , radiant intensity , or radiance , depending on the background of the person using the term . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break also , confusions may be related with the use of atomic percent as measure of concentration of a dopant , or resolution of an imaging system , as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise . see also accuracy and precision and its talk . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the berry paradox arises as a result of systematic ambiguity in the meaning of terms such as " definable " or " nameable " . terms of this kind give rise to vicious circle fallacies . other terms with this type of ambiguity are : satisfiable , true , false , function , property , class , relation , cardinal , and ordinal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in mathematics and logic , ambiguity can be considered to be an instance of the logical concept of underdetermination—for example , xy leaves open what the value of x is—while its opposite is a self - contradiction , also called inconsistency , paradoxicalness , or oxymoron , or in mathematics an inconsistent system—such as x2 , x3 , which has no solution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break logical ambiguity and self - contradiction is analogous to visual ambiguity and impossible objects , such as the necker cube and impossible cube , or many of the drawings of escher . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some languages have been created with the intention of avoiding ambiguity , especially lexical ambiguity . lojban and loglan are two related languages which have been created for this , focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well . the languages can be both spoken and written . these languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages , although historically , such attempts at language improvement have been criticized . languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency . the many exceptions to syntax and semantic rules are time - consuming and difficult to learn . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in structural biology , ambiguity has been recognized as a problem for studying protein conformations . the analysis of a protein three - dimensional structure consists in dividing the macromolecule into subunits called domains . the difficulty of this task arises from the fact that different definitions of what a domain is can be used ( for example folding autonomy , function , thermodynamic stability , or domain motions ) , which sometimes results in a single protein having different—yet equally valid—domain assignments . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break christianity and judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with " ambiguity " . many christians and jews endorse rudolf ottos description of the sacred as ' mysterium tremendum et fascinans ' , the awe - inspiring mystery which fascinates humans . the orthodox catholic writer chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases . ( the title of one of his most famous books , orthodoxy , itself employing such a paradox . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in music , pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous , such as some polytonality , polymeter , other ambiguous meters or rhythms , and ambiguous phrasing , or ( stein 2005 , p . 9 ) any aspect of music . the music of africa is often purposely ambiguous . to quote sir donald francis tovey ( 1935 , p . 95 ) , " theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in visual art , certain images are visually ambiguous , such as the necker cube , which can be interpreted in two ways . perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time , then may flip , a phenomenon called multistable perception . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the opposite of such ambiguous images are impossible objects . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level : the visual image is unambiguous , but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous : is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear , for instance ? uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in social psychology , ambiguity is a factor used in determining peoples ' responses to various situations . high levels of ambiguity in an emergency ( for example an unconscious man lying on a park bench ) make witnesses less likely to offer any sort of assistance , due to the fear that they may have misinterpreted the situation and acted unnecessarily . alternately , non - ambiguous emergencies ( for example an injured person verbally asking for help ) illicit more consistent intervention and assistance . with regard to the bystander effect , studies have shown that emergencies deemed ambiguous trigger the appearance of the classic bystander effect ( wherein more witnesses decrease the likelihood of any of them helping ) far more than non - ambiguous emergencies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in computer science , the si prefixes kilo - , mega - and giga - were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 ( 1024 , 10242 and 10243 ) contrary to the metric system in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand , one million , and one billion . this usage is particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices ( for example dram ) addressed directly by a binary machine register where a decimal interpretation makes no practical sense . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break subsequently , the ki , mi , and gi prefixes were introduced so that binary prefixes could be written explicitly , also rendering k , m , and g unambiguous in texts conforming to the new standard—this led to a new ambiguity in engineering documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes ( necessarily indicating the new style ) as to whether the usage of k , m , and g remains ambiguous ( old style ) or not ( new style ) . 1 m ( where m is ambiguously 1000000 or 1048576 ) is less uncertain than the engineering value 1e6 ( defined to designate the interval 950000 to 1050000 ) . as non - volatile storage devices begin to exceed 1 gb in capacity ( where the ambiguity begins to routinely impact the second significant digit ) , gb and tb almost always mean 109 and 1012 bytes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 68: Abel ***********

abel ; héḇel , in pausa hā́ḇel ; hábel ; is a biblical figure in the book of genesis within abrahamic religions . he was the younger brother of cain , and the younger son of adam and eve , the first couple in biblical history . he was a shepherd who offered his firstborn flock up to god as an offering . god accepted his offering but not his brothers . cain then killed abel out of jealousy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to genesis , this was the first murder in the history of mankind . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to the narrative in genesis , abel ( hébel , in pausa hā́ḇel ; hábel ; , hābēl ) is eves second son . his name in hebrew is composed of the same three consonants as a root meaning " breath " . julius wellhausen has proposed that the name is independent of the root . eberhard schrader had previously put forward the akkadian ( old assyrian dialect ) ablu ( " son " ) as a more likely etymology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in christianity , comparisons are sometimes made between the death of abel and that of jesus , the former thus seen as being the first martyr . in jesus speaks of abel as " righteous " , and the epistle to the hebrews states that " the blood of sprinkling speaks better things than that of abel " . the blood of jesus is interpreted as bringing mercy ; but that of abel as demanding vengeance ( hence the curse and mark ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break abel is invoked in the litany for the dying in the roman catholic church , and his sacrifice is mentioned in the canon of the mass along with those of abraham and melchizedek . the alexandrian rite commemorates him with a feast day on december 28 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to the coptic book of adam and eve ( at 2 : 1–15 ) , and the syriac cave of treasures , abels body , after many days of mourning , was placed in the cave of treasures , before which adam and eve , and descendants , offered their prayers . in addition , the sethite line of the generations of adam swear by abels blood to segregate themselves from the unrighteous . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the book of enoch ( 22 : 7 ) , regarded by most christian and jewish traditions as extra - biblical , the soul of abel is described as having been appointed as the chief of martyrs , crying for vengeance , for the destruction of the seed of cain . a similar view is later shown in the testament of abraham ( a : 13 / b : 11 ) , where abel has been raised to the position as the judge of the souls . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the apocryphon of john , a work belonging to sethian gnosticism , abel is the offspring of yaldaboath and eve , who is placed over the elements of water and earth as elohim , but was only given his name as a form of deception . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to mandaean beliefs and scriptures including the qolastā , the book of john and genzā rabbā , abel is cognate with the angelic soteriological figure hibil ziwa , ( , sometimes translated " splendid hibel " ) , who is spoken of as a son of hayyi or of manda d - hayyi , and as a brother to anush ( enosh ) and to sheetil ( seth ) , elsewhere , anush is spoken of as the son of sheetil , and sheetil as the son of hibil , where hibil came to adam and eve as a young boy when they were still virgins , but was called their son . hibil is an important lightworld being ( uthra ) who conquered the world of darkness . as yawar hibil , he is one of multiple figures known as yawar , being so named by and after his father . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to shia muslim belief , abel ( " habeel " ) is buried in the nabi habeel mosque , located on the west mountains of damascus , near the zabadani valley , overlooking the villages of the barada river ( wadi barada ) , in syria . shia are frequent visitors of this mosque for ziyarat . the mosque was built by ottoman wali ahmad pasha in 1599 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break abel is portrayed by franco nero in the film the bible : in the beginning ( 1966 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

*********** Article 70: Aardvark ***********

the aardvark ( ; orycteropus afer ) is a medium - sized , burrowing , nocturnal mammal native to africa . it is the only living species of the order tubulidentata , although other prehistoric species and genera of tubulidentata are known . unlike most other insectivores , it has a long pig - like snout , which is used to sniff out food . it roams over most of the southern two - thirds of the african continent , avoiding areas that are mainly rocky . a nocturnal feeder , it subsists on ants and termites , which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs . it also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young . the animal is listed as " least concern " by the iucn , although its numbers are decreasing . aardvarks are afrotheres , a clade which also includes elephants , manatees , and hyraxes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardvark is sometimes colloquially called the " african ant bear " , " anteater " ( not to be confused with the south american anteater ) , or the " cape anteater " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " aardvark , n .

rather , it is the sole extant representative of the obscure mammalian order tubulidentata , in which it is usually considered to form one variable species of the genus orycteropus , the sole surviving genus in the family orycteropodidae . the aardvark is not closely related to the south american anteater , despite sharing some characteristics and a superficial resemblance . along with the sirenians , hyraxes , elephants , and their extinct relatives , these animals form the superorder afrotheria . studies of the brain have shown the similarities with condylarthra , and given the clades status as a wastebasket taxon it may mean some species traditionally classified as " condylarths " are actually stem - aardvarks . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break based on fossils , bryan patterson has concluded that early relatives of the aardvark appeared in africa around the end of the paleocene . the ptolemaiidans , a mysterious clade of mammals with uncertain affinities , may actually be stem - aardvarks , either as a sister clade to tubulidentata or as a grade leading to true tubulidentates . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first unambiguous tubulidentate was probably myorycteropus africanus from kenyan miocene deposits . the earliest example from the genus orycteropus was orycteropus mauritanicus , found in algeria in deposits from the middle miocene , with an equally old version found in kenya . fossils from the aardvark have been dated to 5 million years , and have been located throughout europe and the near east . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the mysterious pleistocene plesiorycteropus from madagascar was originally thought to be a tubulidentate that was descended from ancestors that entered the island during the eocene . however , a number of subtle anatomical differences coupled with recent molecular evidence now lead researchers to believe that plesiorycteropus is a relative of golden moles and tenrecs that achieved an aardvark - like appearance and ecological niche through convergent evolution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardvark has seventeen poorly defined subspecies listed : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 1911 encyclopædia britannica also mentions a . capensis or cape ant - bear from south africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardvark is vaguely pig - like in appearance . its body is stout with a prominently arched back and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs . the limbs are of moderate length , with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an aardvarks weight is typically between 60 kg . an aardvarks length is usually between 105 cm , and can reach lengths of 2 m when its tail ( which can be up to 70 cm ) is taken into account . it is 60 cm tall at the shoulder , and has a girth of about 100 cm . it is the largest member of the proposed clade afroinsectiphilia . the aardvark is pale yellowish - gray in color and often stained reddish - brown by soil . the aardvarks coat is thin , and the animals primary protection is its tough skin . its hair is short on its head and tail ; however its legs tend to have longer hair . the hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3 - 4 hairs . the hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs . its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the greatly elongated head is set on a short , thick neck , and the end of the snout bears a disc , which houses the nostrils . it contains a thin but complete zygomatic arch . the teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars . the nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area , as it contains ten nasal conchae , more than any other placental mammal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the sides of the nostrils are thick with hair . its nose is made up of more turbinate bones than any other mammal , with between 9 and 11 , compared to dogs with 4 to 5 . the snout resembles an elongated pig snout . the mouth is small and tubular , typical of species that feed on ants and termites . the aardvark has a long , thin , snakelike , protruding tongue ( as much as 30 cm long ) the ears , which are very effective , are disproportionately long , about 20 cm long . the eyes are small for its head , and consist only of rods . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardvarks stomach has a muscular pyloric area that acts as a gizzard to grind swallowed food up , thereby rendering chewing unnecessary . its cecum is large . both sexes emit a strong smelling secretion from an anal gland . its salivary glands are highly developed and almost completely ring the neck ; their output is what causes the tongue to maintain its tackiness . the female has two pairs of teats in the inguinal region . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break genetically speaking , the aardvark is a living fossil , as its chromosomes are highly conserved , reflecting much of the early eutherian arrangement before the divergence of the major modern taxa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aardvarks are found in sub - saharan africa , where suitable habitat ( savannas , grasslands , woodlands and bushland ) and food ( that is , ants and termites ) is available . they spend the daylight hours in dark burrows to avoid the heat of the day . the only major habitat that they are not present in is swamp forest , as the high water table precludes digging to a sufficient depth . they have been documented as high as 3200 m in ethiopia . they are present throughout sub - saharan africa all the way to south africa with few exceptions including the coastal areas of namibia , ivory coast , and ghana . they are not found in madagascar . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aardvarks live for up to 23years in captivity . its keen hearing warns it of predators : lions , leopards , cheetahs , african wild dogs , hyenas , and pythons . some humans also hunt aardvarks for meat . aardvarks can dig fast or run in zigzag fashion to elude enemies , but if all else fails , they will strike with their claws , tail and shoulders , sometimes flipping onto their backs lying motionless except to lash out with all four feet . they are capable of causing substantial damage to unprotected areas of an attacker . they will also dig to escape as they can . sometimes , when pressed , aardvarks can dig extremely quickly uvmr_ev_paragraph_break . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardvark is nocturnal and is a solitary creature that feeds almost exclusively on ants and termites ( myrmecophagy ) ; the only fruit eaten by aardvarks is the aardvark cucumber . in fact , the cucumber and the aardvark have a symbiotic relationship as they eat the subterranean fruit , then defecate the seeds near their burrows , which then grow rapidly due to the loose soil and fertile nature of the area . the time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed , and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark . they avoid eating the african driver ant and red ants . due to their stringent diet requirements , they require a large range to survive . an aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset , and forages over a considerable home range encompassing 10 km . while foraging for food , the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward , which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food . they zig - zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5–8 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during a foraging period , they will stop to dig a " v " shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location . termite mounds alone dont provide enough food for the aardvark , so they look for termites that are on the move . when these insects move , they can form columns 10 m long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark . these columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals . the trampled grass and dung attract termites from the odontotermes , microtermes , and pseudacanthotermes genera . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of night ( roughly the four hours between 8 : 00p . . and 12 : 00a . . ) ; however , they dont seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other . during adverse weather or if disturbed they will retreat to their burrow systems they cover between 2 km per night ; however , some studies have shown that they may traverse as far as 30 km in a night . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardvark is a rather quiet animal . however , it does make soft grunting sounds as it forages and loud grunts as it makes for its tunnel entrance . when it is threatened it will make for one of its burrows . if one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly . this new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents . it can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes , but otherwise moves fairly slowly . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when leaving the burrow at night , they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes , sniffing and listening . after this period of watchfulness , it will bound out and within seconds it will be 10 m away . it will then pause , prick its ears , twisting its head to listen , then jump and move off to start foraging . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aside from digging out ants and termites , the aardvark also excavates burrows in which to live , which generally fall into one of three categories : burrows made while foraging , refuge and resting location , and permanent homes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aardvarks pair only during the breeding season ; after a gestation period of seven months , one cub weighing around 1 kg is born during may–july . when born , the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles . when nursing , it will nurse off each teat in succession . after two weeks , the folds of skin disappear and after three , the ears can be held upright . after 5–6 weeks , body hair starts growing . it is able to leave the burrow to accompany its mother after only two weeks and eats termites at 9weeks , and is weaned between three months and 16weeks . at six months of age , it is able to dig its own burrows , but it will often remain with the mother until the next mating season , and is sexually mature from approximately two years of age . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aardvarks were thought to have declining numbers , however , this is possibly because they are not readily seen . there are no definitive counts because of their nocturnal and secretive habits ; however , their numbers seem to be stable overall . they are not considered common anywhere in africa , but due to their large range , they maintain sufficient numbers . there may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern , northern , and western africa . southern african numbers are not decreasing . it receives an official designation from the iucn as least concern . however , they are a species in a precarious situation , as they are so dependent on such specific food ; therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites , the species as a whole would be affected drastically . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aardvarks handle captivity well . the first zoo to have one was london zoo in 1869 , which had an animal from south africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in african folklore , the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to soldier ants . hausa magicians make a charm from the heart , skin , forehead , and nails of the aardvark , which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree . wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest , the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night . the charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents ' permission . also , some tribes , such as the margbetu , ayanda , and logo , will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets , which are regarded as good luck charms the meat , which has a resemblance to pork , is eaten in certain cultures . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ancient egyptian god set is usually depicted with the head of an unidentified animal , whose similarity to an aardvark has been noted in scholarship . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the titular character of arthur , an animated television series for children based on a book series and produced by wgbh , shown in more than 180 countries , is an aardvark . in the first book of the series , arthurs nose ( 1976 ) , he has a long , aardvark - like nose , but in later books , his face becomes more rounded . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break otis the aardvark was a puppet character used on childrens bbc programming . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an aardvark features as the antagonist in the cartoon the ant and the aardvark as well as in the canadian animated series the raccoons . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the supersonic fighter - bomber f - 111 / fb - 111 was nicknamed the aardvark because of its long nose resembling the animal . it also had similarities with its nocturnal missions flown at a very low level employing ordnance that could penetrate deep into the ground . in the us navy , the squadron vf - 114 was nicknamed the aardvarks , flying f - 4s and then f - 14s . the squadron mascot was adapted from the animal in the comic strip , which the f - 4 was said to resemble . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cerebus the aardvark is a 300 - issue comic book series by dave sim . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 71: Aardwolf ***********

the aardwolf ( proteles cristata ) is an insectivorous mammal in the family hyaenidae , native to east and southern africa . its name means " earth - wolf " in afrikaans and dutch . it is also called maanhaar - jackal ( afrikaans for " mane - jackal " ) , termite - eating hyena and civet hyena , based on its habit of secreting substances from its anal gland , a characteristic shared with the african civet . mainly termites ; one aardwolf can lap up as many as 250000 termites during a single night using its long , sticky tongue . the aardwolfs tongue has adapted to be tough enough to withstand the strong bite of termites . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardwolf lives in the shrublands of eastern and southern africa – open lands covered with stunted trees and shrubs . it is nocturnal , resting in burrows during the day and emerging at night to seek food . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardwolf is generally classified with the hyena family hyaenidae , though it was formerly placed in its own family protelidae . early on , scientists felt that it was merely mimicking the striped hyena , which subsequently led to the creation of protelidae . recent studies have suggested that the aardwolf probably diverged from other hyaenids early on ; how early is still unclear , as the fossil record and genetic studies disagree by 10 million years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardwolf is the only surviving species in the subfamily protelinae . there is disagreement as to whether the species is monotypic , or can be divided into subspecies c . cristatus of southern africa and c . septentrionalis of east africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the generic name proteles comes from two words both of greek origin , protos and teleos which combined means " complete in front " based on the fact that they have five toes on their front feet and four on the rear . the specific name , cristatus , comes from latin and means " provided with a comb " , relating to their mane . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardwolf resembles a very thin striped hyena , but with a more slender muzzle , black vertical stripes on a coat of yellowish fur , and a long , distinct mane down the midline of the neck and back . it also has one or two diagonal stripes down the fore - and hind - quarters , along with several stripes on its legs . the mane is raised during confrontations to make the aardwolf appear larger . it is missing the throat spot that others in the family have . its lower leg ( from the knee down ) is all black , and its tail is bushy with a black tip . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardwolf is about long , excluding its bushy tail , which is about long , an adult aardwolf weighs approximately , sometimes reaching 15 kg . the aardwolves in the south of the continent tend to be smaller ( about ) than the eastern version ( around ) . this makes the aardwolf , the smallest extant member of the hyaenidae family . the teeth and skull are similar to those of other hyenas , though smaller , and its cheek teeth are specialised for eating insects . it does still have canines , but , unlike other hyenas , these teeth are used primarily for fighting and defense . its ears , which are large , are very similar to those of the striped hyena . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as an aardwolf ages , it will normally lose some of its teeth , though this has little impact on its feeding habits due to the softness of the insects that it eats . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aardwolves live in open , dry plains and bushland , avoiding mountainous areas . due to their specific food requirements , they are only found in regions where termites of the family hodotermitidae occur . termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed grasslands and savannahs , including farmland . for most of the year , aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens , which are occupied for six weeks at a time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are two distinct populations : one in southern africa , and another in east and northeast africa . the species does not occur in the intermediary miombo forests . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an adult pair , along with their most - recent offspring , occupies a territory of 1 km2 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aardwolves are shy and nocturnal , sleeping in burrows by day . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break they have often been mistaken for solitary animals . in fact , they live as monogamous pairs with their young . if their territory is infringed upon , they will chase the intruder up to 400 m or to the border . if the intruder is caught , which rarely happens , a fight will occur , which is accompanied by soft clucking , hoarse barking , and a type of roar . the majority of incursions occur during mating season , when they can occur once or twice per week . when food is scarce , the stringent territorial system may be abandoned and as many as three pairs may occupy a single territory . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the territory is marked by both sexes , as they both have developed anal glands from which they extrude a black substance that is smeared on rocks or grass stalks in 5 mm - long streaks . they often mark near termite mounds within their territory every 20 minutes or so . if they are patrolling their territorial boundaries , the marking frequency increases drastically , to once every 50 m . at this rate , an individual may mark 60 marks per hour , and upwards of 200 per night . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an aardwolf pair may have up to 10 dens , and numerous feces middens , within their territory . when they deposit excreta at their middens , they dig a small hole and cover it with sand . their dens are usually abandoned aardvark , springhare , or porcupine dens , or on occasion they are crevices in rocks . they will also dig their own dens , or enlarge dens started by springhares . they typically will only use one or two dens at a time , rotating through all of their dens every six months . during the summer , they may rest outside their den during the night , and sleep underground during the heat of the day . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators . therefore , when threatened , the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks . if confronted , it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing . it also emits a foul - smelling liquid from its anal glands . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on trinervitermes . this genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolfs range . in east africa , they eat trinervitermes bettonianus , in central africa , they eat trinervitermes rhodesiensis , and in southern africa , they eat trinervoides . their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the aardvark , which digs into the mound . they locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites . an aardwolf may consume up to 250000 termites per night using its long , sticky tongue . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break they do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony , thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food . they often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months . during certain seasonal events , such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter , the primary termites become scarce , so the need for other foods becomes pronounced . during these times , the southern aardwolf will seek out hodotermes mossambicus , a type of harvester termite active in the afternoon , which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter . the eastern aardwolf , during the rainy season , subsists on termites from the genera odontotermes and macrotermes . they are also known to feed on other insects , larvae , eggs , and , some sources say , occasionally small mammals and birds , but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unlike other hyenas , aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals . contrary to popular myths , aardwolves do not eat carrion , and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass , they are actually eating larvae and beetles . also , contrary to some sources , they do not like meat , unless it is finely ground or cooked for them . the adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups , but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers , necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey . their primary source , trinervitermes , forages in small but dense patches of 25 cm . while foraging , the aardwolf can cover about 1 km per hour , which translates to 8 km per summer night and 3 km per winter night . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the breeding season varies depending on location , but normally takes place during autumn or spring . in south africa , breeding occurs in early july . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gestation lasts between 89 and 92 days , producing two to five cubs ( most often two or three ) during the rainy season ( november–december ) , when termites are more active . they are born with their eyes open , but initially are helpless , and weigh around 200 g . the first six to eight weeks are spent in the den with their parents . the male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food . after three months , they begin supervised foraging , and by four months are normally independent , though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season . by the time the next set of cubs is born , the older cubs have moved on . aardwolves generally achieve sexual maturity at one and a half to two years of age . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and is relatively widespread throughout eastern africa . they are not common throughout their range , as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer , if food is abundant . because of these factors , the iucn has rated the aardwolf as least concern . in some areas , they are persecuted because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock ; however , they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental . in other areas , the farmers have recognized this , but they are still killed , on occasion , for their fur . dogs and insecticides are also common killers of the aardwolf . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break frankfurt zoo in germany was home to the oldest recorded aardwolf in captivity at 18 years and 11 months . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 72: Adobe ***********

adobe ( ; ) is a building material made from earth and organic materials , adobe is spanish for mudbrick . in some english - speaking regions of spanish heritage , such as the southwestern united states , the term is used to refer to any kind of earthen construction , or various architectural styles like pueblo revival or territorial revival . most adobe buildings are similar in appearance to cob and rammed earth buildings . adobe is among the earliest building materials , and is used throughout the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break adobe architecture has been dated to before 5100 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break adobe bricks are rectangular prisms small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking . they can be subsequently assembled , with the application of adobe mud to bond the individual bricks into a structure . there is no standard size , with substantial variations over the years and in different regions . in some areas a popular size measured 8 × weighing about 25 lb ; in other contexts the size is 10 × weighing about 35 lb . the maximum sizes can reach up to 100 lb ; above this weight it becomes difficult to move the pieces , and it is preferred to ram the mud in situ , resulting in a different typology known as rammed earth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in dry climates , adobe structures are extremely durable , and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world . adobe buildings offer significant advantages due to their greater thermal mass , but they are known to be particularly susceptible to earthquake damage if they are not reinforced . cases where adobe structures were widely damaged during earthquakes include the 1976 guatemala earthquake , the 2003 bam earthquake , and the 2010 chile earthquake . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break buildings made of sun - dried earth are common throughout the world ( middle east , western asia , north africa , west africa , south america , southwestern north america , southwestern and eastern europe . adobe had been in use by indigenous peoples of the americas in the southwestern united states , mesoamerica , and the andes for several thousand years . puebloan peoples built their adobe structures with handsful or basketsful of adobe , until the spanish introduced them to making bricks . adobe bricks were used in spain from the late bronze and iron ages ( eighth century bce onwards ) . its wide use can be attributed to its simplicity of design and manufacture , and economics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word adobe has existed for around 4000 years with relatively little change in either pronunciation or meaning . the word can be traced from the middle egyptian ( c . 2000bc ) word ḏbt " mud brick " ( with vowels unwritten ) . middle egyptian evolved into late egyptian , demotic or " pre - coptic " , and finally to coptic ( c . 600bc ) , where it appeared as ⲧⲱⲃⲉ tōbə . this was adopted into arabic as الطوب aṭ - ṭawbu or aṭ - ṭūbu , with the definite article al - attached . tuba , this was assimilated into the old spanish language as adobe , probably via mozarabic . english borrowed the word from spanish in the early 18th century , still referring to mudbrick construction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in more modern english usage , the term " adobe " has come to include a style of architecture popular in the desert climates of north america , especially in new mexico , regardless of the construction method . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an adobe brick is a composite material made of earth mixed with water and an organic material such as straw or dung . the soil composition typically contains sand , silt and clay . straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly , thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick . dung offers the same advantage . the most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15 clay , 10–30 silt , and 55–75 fine sand . another source quotes 15–25 clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles 2 in , with no deleterious effect . modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or portland cement up to 10 by weight . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break no more than half the clay content should be expansive clays , with the remainder non - expansive illite or kaolinite . too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick , resulting in cracking , while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick . typically the soils of the southwest united states , where such construction has been widely used , are an adequate composition . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break adobe walls are load bearing , that is they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure , hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength . in the united states , most building codes call for a minimum compressive strength of 300lbf / in2 ( 2newton / mm2 ) for the adobe block . adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads . the building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load . such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls , resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses . to withstand such loads , the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50lbf / in2 ( 0newton / mm2 ) for the finished block . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost , adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction . in climates typified by hot days and cool nights , the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day , moderating the temperature of the living space . the massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun ( radiation ) and from the surrounding air ( convection ) before they warm through to the interior . after the sun sets and the temperature drops , the warm wall will continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time - lag effect . thus , a well - planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates , a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break thermodynamic material properties have significant variation in the literature . some experiments suggest that the standard consideration of conductivity is not adequate for this material , as its main thermodynamic property is inertia , and conclude that experimental tests should be performed over a longer period of time than usual - preferably with changing thermal jumps . there is an effective r - value for a north facing 10 - in wall of r010 hr ft2 °f / btu , which corresponds to thermal conductivity k10 in x 1ft / 12 in / r00 btu / ( hr ft °f ) or 0 w / ( m k ) in agreement with the thermal conductivity reported from another source . to determine the total r - value of a wall , scale r0 by the thickness of the wall in inches . the thermal resistance of adobe is also stated as an r - value for a 10 - inch wall r04 hr ft2 °f / btu . another source provides the following properties : conductivity0 btu / ( hr ft °f ) or 0 w / ( m k ) ; specific heat capacity0 btu / ( lb °f ) or 1 kj / ( kg k ) and density106lb / ft3 or 1700kg / m3 , giving heat capacity25 btu / ( ft3 °f ) or 1700 kj / ( m3 k ) . using the average value of the thermal conductivity as k 32 btu / ( hr ft °f ) or 0 w / ( m k ) , the thermal diffusivity is calculated to be 0ft2 / h or 3x10−7 m2 / s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break poured and puddled adobe ( puddled clay , piled earth ) , today called cob , is made by placing soft adobe in layers , rather than by making individual dried bricks or using a form . " puddle " is a general term for a clay or clay and sand - based material worked into a dense , plastic state . these are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the americas until holes in the ground were used as forms , and later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the spanish . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break bricks made from adobe are usually made by pressing the mud mixture into an open timber frame . in north america , the brick is typically about 25 cm in size . the mixture is molded into the frame , which is removed after initial setting . after drying for a few hours , the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying . slow drying in shade reduces cracking . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the same mixture , without straw , is used to make mortar and often plaster on interior and exterior walls . some cultures used lime - based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break depending on the form into which the mixture is pressed , adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size , provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks . reinforcement can include manure , straw , cement , rebar , or wooden posts . straw , cement , or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can produce a stronger , more crack - resistant brick . a test is done on the soil content first . to do so , a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water , creating an almost completely saturated liquid . the container is shaken vigorously for one minute . it is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers . heavier particles settle out first , sand above , silt above that , and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days . after the water has cleared , percentages of the various particles can be determined . fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks . the cooperative state research , education , and extension service at new mexico state university recommends a mix of not more than ⅓ clay , not less than ½ sand , and never more than ⅓ silt . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the great depression , designer and builder hugh comstock used cheaper materials and made a specialized adobe brick called " bitudobe . " his first adobe house was built in 1936 . in 1948 , he published the book post - adobe ; simplified adobe construction combining a rugged timber frame and modern stabilized adobe , which described his method of construction , including how to make " bitudobe . " in 1938 , he served as an adviser to the architects franklin kump associates , who built the carmel high school , which used his post - adobe system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed , as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall . footing depth is to be below the ground frost level . the footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick , respectively . modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall . adobe bricks are laid by course . adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength . when creating window and door openings , a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above . atop the last courses of brick , bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces . to protect the interior and exterior adobe walls , finishes such as mud plaster , whitewash or stucco can be applied . these protect the adobe wall from water damage , but need to be reapplied periodically . alternatively , the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection . bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soil / clay , water , sand and organic materials . the mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms , producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break depending on the materials available , a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks . depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks , the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly . this method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads . the heaviest wooden beams , called vigas , lie atop the wall . across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas and upon those brush is then laid . finally , the adobe layer is applied . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to construct a flat adobe roof , beams of wood were laid to span the building , the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls . once the vigas , latillas and brush are laid , adobe bricks are placed . an adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof . following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar , recommended to be at least 1 in thick to make certain there is ample strength between the bricks edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break roof design evolved around 1850 in the american southwest . three inches of adobe mud was applied on top of the latillas , then 18 inches of dry adobe dirt applied to the roof . the dirt was contoured into a low slope to a downspout aka a ' canal ' . when moisture was applied to the roof the clay particles expanded to create a waterproof membrane . once a year it was necessary to pull the weeds from the roof and re - slope the dirt as needed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break depending on the materials , adobe roofs can be inherently fire - proof . the construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports , creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials . the builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1927 , the uniform building code ( ubc ) was adopted in the united states . local ordinances , referencing the ubc added requirements to building with adobe . these included : restriction of building height of adobe structures to 1 - story , requirements for adobe mix ( compressive and shear strength ) and new requirements which stated that every building shall be designed to withstand seismic activity , specifically lateral forces . by the 1980s however , seismic related changes in the california building code effectively ended solid wall adobe construction in california ; however post - and - beam adobe and veneers are still being used . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the largest structure ever made from adobe is the arg - é bam built by the achaemenid empire . other large adobe structures are the huaca del sol in peru , with 100 million signed bricks and the ciudellas of chan chan and tambo colorado , both in peru . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 73: Adventure ***********

an adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold , sometimes risky . adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as traveling , exploring , skydiving , mountain climbing , scuba diving , river rafting or participating in extreme sports . adventures are often undertaken to create psychological arousal or in order to achieve a greater goal such as the pursuit of knowledge that can only be obtained in a risky manner . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break adventurous experiences create psychological arousal , which can be interpreted as negative ( for example fear ) or positive ( for example flow ) . for some people , adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself . according to adventurer andré malraux , in his la condition humaine ( 1933 ) , " if a man is not ready to risk his life , where is his dignity ? " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break similarly , helen keller stated that " life is either a daring adventure or nothing . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of recreation or excitement : examples are adventure racing and adventure tourism . adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge , such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the british adventurer jason lewis , for example , uses adventures to draw global sustainability lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren . adventure education intentionally uses challenging experiences for learning . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break author jon levy suggests that an experience should meet several criteria to be considered an adventure : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as homers the odyssey . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the knight errant was the form the " adventure seeker " character took in the late middle ages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the adventure novel exhibits these " protagonist on adventurous journey " characteristics as do many popular feature films , such as star wars and raiders of the lost ark . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the wilderness or mother nature . examples include books such as hatchet or my side of the mountain . these books are less about " questing " , such as in mythology or other adventure novels , but more about surviving on their own , living off the land , gaining new experiences , and becoming closer to the natural world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many adventures are based on the idea of a quest : the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward , whether it be a skill , prize , treasure , or perhaps the safety of a person . on the way , the hero must overcome various obstacles to obtain their reward . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in video - game culture , an adventure game is a video game in which the player assumes the role of a protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and puzzle - solving . the genres focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative - based media , literature and film , encompassing a wide variety of literary genres . many adventure games ( text and graphic ) are designed for a single player , since this emphasis on story and character makes multi - player design difficult . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from ancient times , travelers and explorers have written about their adventures . journals which became best - sellers in their day were written , such as marco polos journal the travels of marco polo or mark twains roughing it . others were personal journals , only later published , such as the journals of lewis and clark or captain james cooks journals . there are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question , such as the right stuff by tom wolfe or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal , such as conquistadors of the useless by lionel terray . documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are many sports classified as adventure games or sports , due to their inherent danger and excitement . some of these include mountain climbing , skydiving , or other extreme sports . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 74: Asia ***********

asia is earths largest and most populous continent , located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres . it shares the continental landmass of eurasia with the continent of europe , and the continental landmass of afro - eurasia with africa and europe . asia covers an area of 44579000 km2 , about 30 of earths total land area and 8 of the earths total surface area . the continent , which has long been home to the majority of the human population , was the site of many of the first civilizations . its 4 billion people constitutes roughly 60 of the worlds population . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in general terms , asia is bounded on the east by the pacific ocean , on the south by the indian ocean , and on the north by the arctic ocean . the border of asia with europe is a historical and cultural construct , as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them . it is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity . the division of eurasia into two continents reflects east–west cultural , linguistic , and ethnic differences , some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line . a commonly accepted division places asia to the east of the suez canal separating it from africa ; and to the east of the turkish straits , the ural mountains and ural river , and to the south of the caucasus mountains and the caspian and black seas , separating it from europe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break china and india alternated in being the largest economies in the world from 1 to 1800 ce . china was a major economic power and attracted many to the east , and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of india personified asia , attracting european commerce , exploration and colonialism . the accidental discovery of a trans - atlantic route from europe to america by columbus while in search for a route to india demonstrates this deep fascination . the silk road became the main east–west trading route in the asian hinterlands while the straits of malacca stood as a major sea route . asia has exhibited economic dynamism ( particularly east asia ) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century , but overall population growth has since fallen . asia was the birthplace of most of the worlds mainstream religions including hinduism , zoroastrianism , judaism , jainism , buddhism , confucianism , taoism , christianity , islam , sikhism , as well as many other religions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break given its size and diversity , the concept of asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography . asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups , cultures , environments , economics , historical ties and government systems it also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the middle east , temperate areas in the east and the continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in siberia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the boundary between asia and africa is the red sea , the gulf of suez , and the suez canal . this makes egypt a transcontinental country , with the sinai peninsula in asia and the remainder of the country in africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the threefold division of the old world into europe , asia and africa has been in use since the 6th century bc , due to greek geographers such as anaximander and hecataeus . anaximander placed the boundary between asia and europe along the phasis river ( the modern rioni river ) in georgia of caucasus ( from its mouth by poti on the black sea coast , through the surami pass and along the kura river to the caspian sea ) , a convention still followed by herodotus in the 5th century bc . during the hellenistic period , according to strabo ( geographica 11 . ) even at the time of alexander , " it was agreed by all that the tanais river separated asia from europe " ( langgrcὡμολόγητο ἐκ πάντων ὅτι διείργει τὴν ἀσίαν ἀπὸ uvmr_ev_paragraph_break τῆς εὐρώπης ὁ τάναϊς ποταμός ; c . . duane roller , eratosthenes ' geography , princeton university press , 2010 , , ) this convention was revised , and the boundary between europe and asia was now considered to be the tanais ( the modern don river ) . this is the convention used by roman era authors such as posidonius , strabo and ptolemy . nobbe 1845 , , p . 178 ) καὶ τῇ εὐρώπῃ δὲ συνάπτει διὰ τοῦ μεταξὺ αὐχένος τῆς τε μαιώτιδος λίμνης καὶ τοῦ σαρματικοῦ ὠκεανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαβάσεως τοῦ τανάϊδος ποταμοῦ . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " and asia is connected to europe by the land - strait between lake maiotis and the sarmatian ocean where the river tanais crosses through . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the border between asia and europe was historically defined by european academics . the don river became unsatisfactory to northern europeans when peter the great , king of the tsardom of russia , defeating rival claims of sweden and the ottoman empire to the eastern lands , and armed resistance by the tribes of siberia , synthesized a new russian empire extending to the ural mountains and beyond , founded in 1721 . the major geographical theorist of the empire was a former swedish prisoner - of - war , taken at the battle of poltava in 1709 and assigned to tobolsk , where he associated with peters siberian official , vasily tatishchev , and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in sweden , five years after peters death , in 1730 philip johan von strahlenberg published a new atlas proposing the ural mountains as the border of asia . tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von strahlenberg . the latter had suggested the emba river as the lower boundary . over the next century various proposals were made until the ural river prevailed in the mid - 19th century . the border had been moved perforce from the black sea to the caspian sea into which the ural river projects . the border between the black sea and the caspian is usually placed along the crest of the caucasus mountains , although it is sometimes placed further north . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the border between asia and the region of oceania is usually placed somewhere in the malay archipelago . the maluku islands in indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast asia , with new guinea , to the east of the islands , being wholly part of oceania . the terms southeast asia and oceania , devised in the 19th century , have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception . the chief factor in determining which islands of the malay archipelago are asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there ( not all european ) . lewis and wigen assert , " the narrowing of ' southeast asia ' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break geographical asia is a cultural artifact of european conceptions of the world , beginning with the ancient greeks , being imposed onto other cultures , an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means . asia does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from the time of herodotus a minority of geographers have rejected the three - continent system ( europe , africa , asia ) on the grounds that there is no substantial physical separation between them . for example , sir barry cunliffe , the emeritus professor of european archeology at oxford , argues that europe has been geographically and culturally merely " the western excrescence of the continent of asia " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break geographically , asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of eurasia with europe being a northwestern peninsula of the landmass . asia , europe and africa make up a single continuous landmass—afro - eurasia ( except for the suez canal ) —and share a common continental shelf . almost all of europe and a major part of asia sit atop the eurasian plate , adjoined on the south by the arabian and indian plate and with the easternmost part of siberia ( east of the chersky range ) on the north american plate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the idea of a place called " asia " was originally a concept of greek civilization , though this might not correspond to the entire continent currently known by that name . the english word comes from latin literature , where it has the same form , " asia " . whether " asia " in other languages comes from latin of the roman empire is much less certain , and the ultimate source of the latin word is uncertain , though several theories have been published . one of the first classical writers to use asia as a name of the whole continent was pliny . this metonymical change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names , such as scandinavia ( from scania ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before greek poetry , the aegean sea area was in a greek dark age , at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun . prior to then in the bronze age the records of the assyrian empire , the hittite empire and the various mycenaean states of greece mention a region undoubtedly asia , certainly in anatolia , including if not identical to lydia . these records are administrative and do not include poetry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 bce by unknown agents , though one school of thought assigns the dorian invasion to this time . the burning of the palaces caused the clay tablets holding the mycenaean administrative records to be preserved by baking . these tablets were written in a greek syllabic script called linear this script was deciphered by a number of interested parties , most notably by a young world war ii cryptographer , michael ventris , subsequently assisted by the scholar , john chadwick . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a major cache discovered by carl blegen at the site of ancient pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods . some of these are of women held in servitude ( as study of the society implied by the content reveals ) . they were used in trades , such as cloth - making , and usually came with children . the epithet lawiaiai , " captives " , associated with some of them identifies their origin . some are ethnic names . one in particular , aswiai , identifies " women of asia " . perhaps they were captured in asia , but some others , milatiai , appear to have been of miletus , a greek colony , which would not have been raided for slaves by greeks . chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased . the name is also in the singular , aswia , which refers both to the name of a country and to a female from there . there is a masculine form , . this aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the hittites as assuwa , centered on lydia , or " roman asia " . this name , assuwa , has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent " asia " . the assuwa league was a confederation of states in western anatolia , defeated by the hittites under tudhaliya i around 1400 bce . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break latin asia and greek ἀσία appear to be the same word . roman authors translated ἀσία as asia . the romans named a province asia , located in western anatolia ( in modern - day turkey ) . there was an asia minor and an asia major located in modern - day iraq . as the earliest evidence of the name is greek , it is likely circumstantially that asia came from ἀσία , but ancient transitions , due to the lack of literary contexts , are difficult to catch in the act . the most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians , such as herodotus , who were all greek . ancient greek certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first continental use of asia is attributed to herodotus ( about 440 bce ) , not because he innovated it , but because his histories are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail . he defines it carefully , mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read , but whose works are now missing . by it he means anatolia and the persian empire , in contrast to greece and egypt . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three womens names were " given to a tract which is in reality one " ( europa , asia , and libya , referring to africa ) , stating that most greeks assumed that asia was named after the wife of prometheus ( that is hesione ) , but that the lydians say it was named after asies , son of cotys , who passed the name on to a tribe at sardis . in greek mythology , " asia " ( ἀσία ) or " asie " ( ἀσίη ) was the name of a " nymph or titan goddess of lydia " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in ancient greek religion , places were under the care of female divinities , parallel to guardian angels . the poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories , which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical greek drama and became " greek mythology " . for example , hesiod mentions the daughters of tethys and ocean , among whom are a " holy company " , " who with the lord apollo and the rivers have youths in their keeping " . many of these are geographic : doris , rhodea , europa , asia . hesiod explains : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the iliad ( attributed by the ancient greeks to homer ) mentions two phrygians ( the tribe that replaced the luvians in lydia ) in the trojan war named asios ( an adjective meaning " asian " ) ; and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in lydia as ασιος . according to many muslims , the term came from ancient egypts queen asiya , the adoptive mother of moses . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the history of asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions : east asia , south asia , southeast asia and the middle east , linked by the interior mass of the central asian steppes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the coastal periphery was home to some of the worlds earliest known civilizations , each of them developing around fertile river valleys . the civilizations in mesopotamia , the indus valley and the yellow river shared many similarities . these civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel . other innovations , such as writing , seem to have been developed individually in each area . cities , states and empires developed in these lowlands . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse - mounted nomads who could reach all areas of asia from the steppes . the earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the indo - europeans , who spread their languages into the middle east , south asia , and the borders of china , where the tocharians resided . the northernmost part of asia , including much of siberia , was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads , owing to the dense forests , climate and tundra . these areas remained very sparsely populated . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts . the caucasus and himalaya mountains and the karakum and gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty . while the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially , in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe . however , the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force ; for this and other reasons , the nomads who conquered states in china , india , and the middle east often found themselves adapting to the local , more affluent societies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the islamic caliphates defeats of the byzantine and persian empires led to west asia and southern parts of central asia and western parts of south asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century . the mongol empire conquered a large part of asia in the 13th century , an area extending from china to europe . before the mongol invasion , song dynasty reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens ; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the black death , one of the most devastating pandemics in human history , is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia , where it then travelled along the silk road . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the russian empire began to expand into asia from the 17th century , and would eventually take control of all of siberia and most of central asia by the end of the 19th century . the ottoman empire controlled anatolia , most of the middle east , north africa and the balkans from the mid 16th century onwards . in the 17th century , the manchu conquered china and established the qing dynasty . the islamic mughal empire and the hindu maratha empire controlled much of india in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively . the empire of japan controlled most of east asia and much of southeast asia , new guinea and the pacific islands until the end of world war ii . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asia is the largest continent on earth . it covers 9 of the earths total surface area ( or 30 of its land area ) , and has the longest coastline , at 62800 km . asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four - fifths of eurasia . it is located to the east of the suez canal and the ural mountains , and south of the caucasus mountains ( or the kuma–manych depression ) and the caspian and black seas . it is bounded on the east by the pacific ocean , on the south by the indian ocean and on the north by the arctic ocean . asia is subdivided into 49 countries , five of them ( georgia , azerbaijan , russia , kazakhstan and turkey ) are transcontinental countries lying partly in europe . geographically , russia is partly in asia , but is considered a european nation , both culturally and politically . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the gobi desert is in mongolia and the arabian desert stretches across much of the middle east . the yangtze river in china is the longest river in the continent . the himalayas between nepal and china is the tallest mountain range in the world . tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are various approaches to the regional division of asia . the following subdivision into regions is used , among others , by the un statistics agency unsd . this division of asia into regions by the united nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asia has extremely diverse climate features . climates range from arctic and subarctic in siberia to tropical in southern india and southeast asia . it is moist across southeast sections , and dry across much of the interior . some of the largest daily temperature ranges on earth occur in western sections of asia . the monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections , due to the presence of the himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer . southwestern sections of the continent are hot . siberia is one of the coldest places in the northern hemisphere , and can act as a source of arctic air masses for north america . the most active place on earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the philippines and south of japan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change . each nations vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio , economic and environmental indicators , which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years . the asian countries of bangladesh , india , the philippines , vietnam , thailand , pakistan , china and sri lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change . some shifts are already occurring . for example , in tropical parts of india with a semi - arid climate , the temperature increased by 0°c between 1901 and 2003 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a 2013 study by the international crops research institute for the semi - arid tropics ( icrisat ) aimed to find science - based , pro - poor approaches and techniques that would enable asias agricultural systems to cope with climate change , while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers . the studys recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather - based agro - advisory services , to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover , replenish groundwater and use renewable energy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ten countries of the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) – brunei , cambodia , indonesia , laos , malaysia , myanmar , the philippines , singapore , thailand , and vietnam – are among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the world , however , aseans climate mitigation efforts are not commensurate with the climate threats and risks it faces . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asia has the largest continental economy by both gdp nominal and ppp in the world , and is the fastest growing economic region . , the largest economies in asia are china , japan , india , south korea , indonesia and turkey based on gdp in both nominal and ppp . based on global office locations 2011 , asia dominated the office locations with 4 of the top 5 being in asia : hong kong , singapore , tokyo and seoul . around 68 percent of international firms have an office in hong kong . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the late 1990s and early 2000s , the economies of china and india have been growing rapidly , both with an average annual growth rate of more than 8 . other recent very - high - growth nations in asia include israel , malaysia , indonesia , bangladesh , thailand , vietnam , and the philippines , and mineral - rich nations such as kazakhstan , turkmenistan , iran , brunei , the united arab emirates , qatar , kuwait , saudi arabia , bahrain and oman . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to economic historian angus maddison in his book the world economy : a millennial perspective , india had the worlds largest economy during 0 bce and 1000 bce . historically , india was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century , contributing 25 of the worlds industrial output . china was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with india . for several decades in the late twentieth century japan was the largest economy in asia and second - largest of any single nation in the world , after surpassing the soviet union ( measured in net material product ) in 1990 and germany in 1968 . ( nb : a number of supernational economies are larger , such as the european union ( eu ) , the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) or apec ) . this ended in 2010 when china overtook japan to become the worlds second largest economy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the late 1980s and early 1990s , japans gdp was almost as large ( current exchange rate method ) as that of the rest of asia combined . in 1995 , japans economy nearly equaled that of the us as the largest economy in the world for a day , after the japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen / us . economic growth in asia since world war ii to the 1990s had been concentrated in japan as well as the four regions of south korea , taiwan , hong kong and singapore located in the pacific rim , known as the asian tigers , which have now all received developed country status , having the highest gdp per capita in asia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is forecasted that india will overtake japan in terms of nominal gdp by 2025 . by 2027 , according to goldman sachs , china will have the largest economy in the world . several trade blocs exist , with the most developed being the association of southeast asian nations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin , and it is rich in natural resources , such as petroleum , forests , fish , water , rice , copper and silver . manufacturing in asia has traditionally been strongest in east and southeast asia , particularly in china , taiwan , south korea , japan , india , the philippines , and singapore . japan and south korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations , but increasingly the prc and india are making significant inroads . many companies from europe , north america , south korea and japan have operations in asias developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to citigroup 9 of 11 global growth generators countries came from asia driven by population and income growth . they are bangladesh , china , india , indonesia , iraq , mongolia , the philippines , sri lanka and vietnam . asia has three main financial centers : hong kong , tokyo and singapore . call centers and business process outsourcing ( bpos ) are becoming major employers in india and the philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled , english - speaking workers . the increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of india and the china as financial centers . due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry , india has become a major hub for outsourcing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break trade between asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for asia . individual main routes have emerged from this . the main route leads from the chinese coast south via hanoi to jakarta , singapore and kuala lumpur through the strait of malacca via the sri lankan colombo to the southern tip of india via malé to east africa mombasa , from there to djibouti , then through the red sea over the suez canal into mediterranean , there via haifa , istanbul and athens to the upper adriatic to the northern italian hub of trieste with its rail connections to central and eastern europe or further to barcelona and around spain and france to the european northern ports . a far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via south africa to europe . a particularly significant part of the asian goods traffic is carried out across the pacific towards los angeles and long beach . in contrast to the sea routes , the silk road via the land route to europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope . intra - asian trade , including sea trade , is growing rapidly . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2010 , asia had 3 million millionaires ( people with net worth over us1 million excluding their homes ) , slightly below north america with 3 million millionaires . last year asia had toppled europe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break citigroup in the wealth report 2012 stated that asian centa -

*********** Article 75: Aruba ***********

aruba ( , , ) is a constituent country of the kingdom of the netherlands physically located in the mid - south of the caribbean sea , about 29 km north of the venezuelan peninsula of paraguaná and 80 km northwest of curaçao . it measures 32 km long from its northwestern to its southeastern end and 10 km across at its widest point . together with bonaire and curaçao , aruba forms a group referred to as the abc islands . collectively , these and the other three dutch substantial islands in the caribbean are often called the dutch caribbean , of which aruba has about one - third of the population . in 1986 , it became a constituent country within the kingdom of the netherlands , and acquired the formal name the country of aruba . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba is one of the four countries that form the kingdom of the netherlands , along with the netherlands , curaçao , and sint maarten ; the citizens of these countries are all dutch nationals . aruba has no administrative subdivisions , but , for census purposes , is divided into eight regions . its capital is oranjestad . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unlike much of the caribbean region , aruba has a dry climate and an arid , cactus - strewn landscape . its area is and it is quite densely populated , with 101484 inhabitants as at the 2010 census . a january 2019 estimate of the population placed it at 116600 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the name aruba most likely came from the caquetio oruba which means " well situated island " , seeing as it was the caquetio who were present on the island when it was first set foot upon by alonso de ojeda . between 1529 and the signing of the treaty of westphalia the name " isla de oruba " was used for the island by the spanish . after the signing the island was ceded to the dutch and its name was changed to aruba . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there were many different names for aruba used by other amerindian groups , all of which could have contributed to the present - day name aruba . another caquetio name for the island was oibubia which means " guided island " . the taino name for the island was arubeira . the kalinago also had two names for the island ora oubao which means " shell island " and oirubae which means " companion of curaçao " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a common misconception is that the name aruba came from the spanish oro hubo which means " there was gold " . however the spanish found no gold on aruba during the time of their occupation , nicknaming aruba and the rest of the abc islands islas inútiles , meaning " useless islands " due to the lack of gold . it was not until much later in 1824 that gold was found on aruba by willem rasmijn , starting the aruban gold rush . another early spanish name for aruba was isla de brasil , named as such because of the many brazilwood trees that grew on the island . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there has been a human presence on aruba from as early as circa 2000 bc . the first identifiable group are the arawak caquetío amerindians who migrated from south america about 1000 ad . archaeological evidence suggests continuing links between these native arubans and amerindian peoples of mainland south america . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first europeans to visit aruba were amerigo vespucci and alonso de ojeda in 1499 , who claimed the island for spain . vespucci and ojedas tales spurred interest in aruba , and the spanish began colonising the island . alonso de ojeda was appointed the islands first governor in 1508 . from 1513 the spanish began enslaving the caquetíos , sending many to a life of forced labour in the mines of hispaniola . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the netherlands seized aruba from spain in 1636 in the course of the thirty years ' war . students on curaçao , aruba , and bonaire were taught predominantly in spanish until the late 18th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the napoleonic wars , the british empire took control of the island , occupying it between 1806 and 1816 , before handing it back to the dutch as per the terms of the anglo - dutch treaty of 1814 . aruba subsequently became part of the colony of curaçao and dependencies along with bonaire . during the 19th century , an economy based on gold mining , phosphate production and aloe vera plantations developed , but the island remained a relatively poor backwater . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first oil refinery in aruba was built in 1928 by royal dutch shell . the facility was built just to the west of the capital city , oranjestad , and was commonly called the eagle . immediately following that , another refinery was built by lago oil and transport company , in an area now known as san nicolas on the east end of aruba . the refineries processed crude oil from the vast venezuelan oil fields , bringing greater prosperity to the island . the refinery on aruba grew to become one of the largest in the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during world war ii , the netherlands was occupied by nazi germany . in 1940 , the oil facilities in aruba came under the administration of the dutch government - in - exile in london , causing them to be attacked by the german navy in 1942 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in august 1947 , aruba formulated its first staatsreglement ( constitution ) for arubas status aparte as an autonomous state within the kingdom of the netherlands , prompted by the efforts of henny eman , a noted aruban politician . by 1954 , the charter of the kingdom of the netherlands was established , providing a framework for relations between aruba and the rest of the kingdom . that created the netherlands antilles , which united all of the dutch colonies in the caribbean into one administrative structure . many arubans were unhappy with the arrangement , however , as the new polity was perceived as being dominated by curaçao . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1972 , at a conference in suriname , betico croes , a politician from aruba , proposed the creation of a dutch commonwealth of four states : aruba , the netherlands , suriname , and the netherlands antilles , each to have its own nationality . backed by his newly created party , the movimiento electoral di pueblo , croes sought greater autonomy for aruba , with the long - term goal of independence , adopting the trappings of an independent state in 1976 with the creation of a flag and national anthem . tensions mounted as croes stepped up the pressure on the dutch government by organising a general strike in 1977 . croes later met with dutch prime minister joop den uyl , with the two sides agreeing to assign the institute of social studies in the hague to prepare a study for independence , entitled aruba en onafhankelijkheid , achtergronden , modaliteiten , en mogelijkheden ; een rapport in eerste aanleg ( aruba and independence , backgrounds , modalities , and opportunities ; a preliminary report ) ( 1978 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in march 1983 , aruba reached an official agreement within the kingdom for its independence , to be developed in a series of steps as the crown granted increasing autonomy . in august 1985 , aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved . on 1 january 1986 , after elections were held for its first parliament , aruba seceded from the netherlands antilles , officially becoming a country of the kingdom of the netherlands , with full independence planned for 1996 . however , croes was seriously injured in a traffic accident in 1985 , slipping into a coma . he died in 1986 , never seeing the enacting of status aparte for aruba for which he had worked over many years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after his death , croes was proclaimed libertador di aruba . the significant blow to the economy led to a push for a dramatic increase in tourism , and that sector has expanded to become the islands largest industry . at a convention in the hague in 1990 , at the request of arubas prime minister nelson oduber , the governments of aruba , the netherlands , and the netherlands antilles postponed indefinitely arubas transition to full independence . the article scheduling arubas complete independence was rescinded in 1995 , although it was decided that the process could be revived after another referendum . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba is a generally flat , riverless island in the leeward antilles island arc of the lesser antilles in the southern part of the caribbean . it lies 48 mi west of curaçao and 18 mi north of venezuelas paraguaná peninsula . this is where the bulk of the population live and where most tourist development has occurred . the northern and eastern coasts , lacking this protection , are considerably more battered by the sea and have been left largely untouched . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the hinterland of the island features some rolling hills , such as hooiberg at 165 m and mount jamanota , the highest on the island at 188 m above sea level . oranjestad , the capital , is located at . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the natural bridge was a large , naturally formed limestone bridge on the islands north shore . it was a popular tourist destination until its collapse in 2005 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the island , with a population of about 116600 people ( 1 january 2019 estimate ) most of the islands population resides in or around the two major city - like districts of oranjestad ( the capital ) and san nicolaas . oranjestad and san nicolaas are both divided into two districts for census purposes only . the districts are as follows : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the isolation of aruba from the mainland of south america has fostered the evolution of multiple endemic animals . the island provides a habitat for the endemic aruban whiptail and aruba rattlesnake , as well as an endemic subspecies of burrowing owl and brown - throated parakeet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the flora of aruba differs from the typical tropical island vegetation . xeric scrublands are common , with various forms of cacti , thorny shrubs , and evergreens . aloe vera is also present , its economic importance earning it a place on the coat of arms of aruba . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cacti like melocactus and opuntia are represented on aruba by species like opuntia stricta . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break trees like caesalpinia coriaria and vachellia tortuosa are drought tolerant . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by the köppen climate classification , aruba has a hot semi - arid climate ( köppen bsh ) . rainfall is scarce , only 300 millimeters ( 12 inches ) per year ; in particular , rainy season is drier than it normally is in tropical climates ; during the dry season , it almost never rains . owing to the scarcity of rainfall , the landscape of aruba is arid . mean monthly temperature in oranjestad varies little from 27 °c to 29 c , moderated by constant trade winds from the atlantic ocean , which come from the north - east . yearly rainfall barely exceeds 350 mm in oranjestad , although it is extremely variable and can range from as little as during strong el niño years ( for example 1911 / 1912 , 1930 / 1931 , 1982 / 1983 , 1997 / 1998 ) to over 1000 mm in la niña years like 1933 / 1934 , 1970 / 1971 or 1988 / 1989 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba is south of the typical latitudes of hurricanes but was affected by two in their early stages in late 2020 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in terms of country of birth , the population is estimated to be 66 aruban , 9 colombian , 4 dutch , 4 dominican , 3 venezuelan , 2 curaçaoan , 1 haitian , 1 surinamese , 1 peruvian , 1 chinese , 6 other . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in terms of ethnic composition , the population is estimated to be 75 mestizo , 15 black and 10 other ethnicities . arawak heritage is stronger on aruba than on most caribbean islands ; although no full - blooded aboriginals remain , the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic arawak heritage . most of the population is descended from caquetio indians , african slaves , and dutch settlers , and to a lesser extent the various other groups that have settled on the island over time , such as the spanish , portuguese , english , french , and sephardic jews . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break recently , there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighbouring south american and caribbean nations , attracted by the higher paid jobs . in 2007 , new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting foreign workers to a maximum of three years residency on the island . most notable are those from venezuela , which lies just 18 mi to the south . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2019 , recently arrived venezuelan refugees were estimated to number around 17000 , accounting for some 15 of the islands population . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arubas official languages are dutch and papiamento . while dutch is the sole language for all administration and legal matters , papiamento is the predominant language used on aruba . papiamento is a portuguese - and spanish - based creole language , spoken on aruba , bonaire , and curaçao , that also incorporates words from dutch and various west african languages . english and spanish are also spoken , their usage having grown due to tourism . other common languages spoken , based on the size of their community , are portuguese , cantonese , french and german . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in recent years , the government of aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of papiamento . although spoken papiamento is fairly similar among the several papiamento - speaking islands , there is a big difference in written papiamento : the orthography differs per island , with aruba using etymological spelling , and curaçao and bonaire a phonetic spelling . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the book buccaneers of america , first published in 1678 , states through eyewitness account that the natives on aruba spoke spanish already . spanish became an important language in the 18th century due to the close economic ties with spanish colonies in what are now venezuela and colombia . venezuelan tv networks are received on the island , and aruba also has significant venezuelan and colombian communities . around 13 of the population today speaks spanish natively . use of english dates to the early 19th century , when the british took curaçao , aruba , and bonaire . when dutch rule resumed in 1815 , officials already noted wide use of the language . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba has newspapers published in papiamento : diario , bon dia , solo di pueblo , and awe mainta ; english : aruba daily , aruba today , and the news ; and dutch : amigoe . aruba has 18 radio stations ( two am and 16 fm ) and two television stations ( telearuba and channel 22 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break roman catholicism is the dominant religion , practised by about 75 of the population . various protestant denominations are also present on the island . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba is cartographically split into eight for censuses ; these regions have no administrative function ; some allude to parishes which include a few charitable community facilities : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break along with the netherlands , curaçao , and sint maarten , aruba is a constituent country of the kingdom of the netherlands , with internal autonomy . the governor of aruba is appointed for a six -

defunct ) netherlands antilles ; however , it separated from that entity in 1986 , gaining its own constitution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba is designated as a member of the overseas countries and territories ( oct ) and is thus officially not a part of the european union , though aruba can and does receive support from the european development fund . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the aruban legal system is based on the dutch model . in aruba , legal jurisdiction lies with the gerecht in eerste aanleg ( court of first instance ) on aruba , the gemeenschappelijk hof van justitie van aruba , curaçao , sint maarten , en van bonaire , sint eustatius en saba ( joint court of justice of aruba , curaçao , sint maarten , and of bonaire , sint eustatius and saba ) and the hoge raad der nederlanden ( supreme court of justice of the netherlands ) . the korps politie aruba ( aruba police force ) is the islands law enforcement agency and operates district precincts in oranjestad , noord , san nicolaas , and santa cruz , where it is headquartered . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break deficit spending has been a staple in arubas history , and modestly high inflation has been present as well . by 2006 , the governments debt had grown to 1billion aruban florins . in 2006 , the aruban government changed several tax laws to reduce the deficit . direct taxes have been converted to indirect taxes as proposed by the imf . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba is one of the overseas countries and territories ( oct ) of the european union and maintains economic and cultural relations with the european union and the united states . aruba is also a member of several international organizations such as the international monetary fund and interpol . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break defence on aruba is the responsibility of the kingdom of the netherlands . the dutch armed forces that protect the island include the navy , marine corps , and the coastguard including a platoon sized national guard . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all forces are stationed at marines base in savaneta . furthermore , in 1999 , the department of defense established a forward operating location ( fol ) at the airport . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arubas educational system is patterned after the dutch system of education . the government of aruba finances the public national education system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schools are a mixture of public and private , including the international school of aruba , the schakel college and mostly the colegio arubano . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are three medical schools , american university school of medicine aruba ( ausoma ) , aureus university school of medicine and xavier university school of medicine , as well as its own national university , the university of aruba . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the islands economy is dominated by four main industries : tourism , aloe export , petroleum refining , and offshore banking . its main trading partners are colombia , the united states , venezuela , and the netherlands . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the agriculture and manufacturing sectors are fairly minimal . gold mining was important in the 19th century . aloe was introduced to aruba in 1840 but did not become a big export until 1890 . cornelius eman founded aruba aloe balm , and over time the industry became very important to the economy . at one point , two - thirds of the island was covered in aloe vera fields , and aruba became the largest exporter of aloe in the world . the industry continues today , though on a smaller scale . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break access to biocapacity in aruba is much lower than world average . in 2016 , aruba had 0 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory , much less than the world average of 1 global hectares per person . ite journallast1linfirst1davidlast2hanscomfirst2laurellast3murthyfirst3adelinelast4gallifirst4alessandrolast5evansfirst5mikellast6neillfirst6evanlast7mancinifirst7mariaserenalast8martindillfirst8jonlast9medouarfirst9fatimezahralast10huangfirst10shiyulast11wackernagel uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the official exchange rate of the aruban florin is pegged to the us dollar at 1 florins to us1 . this fact , and the majority of tourists being us , means businesses of hotel and resort districts prefer to bank and trade with the consumer in us dollars . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba is a prosperous country . unemployment is low ( although the government has not published statistics since 2013 ) and per capita income is one of the highest in the caribbean ( approximately 24087 ) . at the end of 2018 , the labor force participation rate was 56 for women . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break until the mid - 1980s , arubas main industry was oil refining . then the refinery was shut down and the islands economy shifted towards tourism . currently , aruba receives about 1235673 ( 2007 ) guests per year , of which three - quarters are americans . tourism is mainly focused on the beaches and the sea . the refinery has been closed and restarted repeatedly during the last decades . in recent years a letter of intent was signed with citgo ( the us subsidiary of the venezuelan state oil company pdvsa ) to explore the possibility of reopening the refinery again . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break until 2009 , the netherlands granted development aid to aruba . this aid was mainly for law enforcement , education , administrative development , health care and sustainable economic development . this aid was discontinued at arubas request in 2009 . since 2015 , however , a form of financial supervision has been reintroduced because arubas debt has risen sharply to over 80 of gdp . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba also has two free trade zones ( barcadera and bushiri ) , where import and export and the movement of services are tax - free . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba has a large and well - developed tourism industry , receiving 1082000 tourists who stayed overnight in its territory in 2018 . about of the aruban gross national product is earned through tourism and related activities . most tourists are from north america , with a market - share of 73 , followed by latin america with 15 and europe with 8 . in 2018 , there were 40231 visitors from the netherlands . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for private aircraft passengers bound for the united states , the united states department of homeland security ( dhs ) , customs and border protection ( cbp ) has a full pre - clearance facility since 1 february 2001 when queen beatrix airport expanded . since 2008 , aruba has been the only island to have this service for private flights . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are many luxury and lesser luxury hotels , concentrated mainly on the west coast beaches . in palm beach are the luxury hotels aimed at american tourists . this area is also called " highrise - area " , because most of the hotels are located in ( by aruban standards ) high - rise buildings . eagle beach , a short distance from palm beach in the direction of oranjestad , offers hotels on a somewhat smaller and more intimate scale in low - rise buildings , hence the name " lowrise - area " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break oranjestad is the port for the many cruise ships that visit aruba . the cruise industry is a very important pillar of tourism in aruba , since during a cruise a large part of the passengers go ashore to visit the island . with 334 cruise calls , aruba received 815161 cruise tourists in 2018 . the 2017 / 2018 cruise season brought 102 million to arubas economy . oranjestad is also home to several luxury hotels , upscale shopping malls , tourist - oriented shopping streets , and hospitality facilities . the main street , called caya ( betico ) croes , has been redesigned in recent years , including new paving , new palm trees and a streetcar line for tourists . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba has a varied culture . according to the bureau burgelijke stand en bevolkingsregister ( bbsb ) , in 2005 there were ninety - two different nationalities living on the island . dutch influence can still be seen , as in the celebration of " sinterklaas " on 5 and 6 december and other national holidays like 27 april , when in aruba and the rest of the kingdom of the netherlands the kings birthday or " dia di rey " ( koningsdag ) is celebrated . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on 18 march , aruba celebrates its national day . christmas and new years eve are celebrated with the typical music and songs for gaitas for christmas and the dande for new year , and ayaca , ponche crema , ham , and other typical foods and drinks . on 25 january , betico croes ' birthday is celebrated . dia di san juan is celebrated on 24 june . besides christmas , the religious holy days of the feast of the ascension and good friday are also holidays on the island . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the festival of carnaval is also an important one in aruba , as it is in many caribbean and latin american countries . its celebration in aruba started in the 1950s , influenced by the inhabitants from venezuela and the nearby islands ( curaçao , st . vincent , trinidad , barbados , st . maarten , and anguilla ) who came to work for the oil refinery . over the years , the carnival celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of january until the tuesday before ash wednesday , with a large parade on the last sunday of the festivities ( the sunday before ash wednesday ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tourism from the united states has recently increased the visibility of american culture on the island , with such celebrations as halloween in october and thanksgiving day in november . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from the beginning of the colonization of the netherlands until the beginning of the 20th century , the architecture in the most inhabited areas of aruba was influenced by the dutch colonial style and also some spanish elements from the catholic missionaries present in aruba who later settled in venezuela as well . after the boom of the oil industry and the tourist sector in the 20th century the architectural style of the island incorporated a more american and international influence . in addition , elements of the art deco style can still be seen in several buildings in san nicolas . therefore , it can be said that the islands architecture is a mixture of spanish , dutch , american and caribbean influences . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arubas queen beatrix international airport is near oranjestad . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aruba has four ports : barcadera , the main cargo port , paardenbaai , the cruise ship terminal in oranjestad / taratata , commandeurs baai ( commanders bay ) in savaneta , and sint nicolaas baai in san nicolaas . paardenbaai services all the cruise - ship lines such as royal caribbean , carnival , ncl , holland america , msc cruises , costa cruises , po cruises and disney . nearly one million tourists enter this port per year . aruba ports authority , owned and operated by the aruban government , runs these seaports . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arubus is a government -

*********** Article 76: Articles of Confederation ***********

the articles of confederation and perpetual union was an agreement among the 13 original states of the united states of america that served as its first frame of government . it was approved after much debate ( between july 1776 and november 1777 ) by the second continental congress on november 15 , 1777 , and sent to the states for ratification . the articles of confederation came into force on march 1 , 1781 , after ratification by all the states . a guiding principle of the articles was to establish and preserve the independence and sovereignty of the states . the weak central government established by the articles received only those powers which the former colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the document provided clearly written rules for how the states ' " league of friendship " ( perpetual union ) would be organized . during the ratification process , the congress looked to the articles for guidance as it conducted business , directing the war effort , conducting diplomacy with foreign states , addressing territorial issues and dealing with native american relations . little changed politically once the articles of confederation went into effect , as ratification did little more than legalize what the continental congress had been doing . that body was renamed the congress of the confederation ; but most americans continued to call it the continental congress , since its organization remained the same . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as the confederation congress attempted to govern the continually growing states , delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so . as the governments weaknesses became apparent , especially after shays ' rebellion , some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling union began asking for changes to the articles . their hope was to create a stronger government . initially , in september 1786 , some states met to address interstate protectionist trade barriers between them . shortly thereafter , as more states became interested in meeting to revise the articles , a meeting was set in philadelphia on may 25 , 1787 . this became the constitutional convention . delegates quickly agreed that the defects of the frame of government could not be remedied by altering the articles , and so went beyond their mandate by replacing it with a new constitution . on march 4 , 1789 , the government under the articles was replaced with the federal government under the constitution . the new constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive ( the president ) , courts , and taxing powers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the political push to increase cooperation among the then - loyal colonies began with the albany congress in 1754 and benjamin franklins proposed albany plan , an inter - colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems over the next two decades , some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen ; others would weaken , especially in the degree of loyalty ( or lack thereof ) owed the crown . civil disobedience resulted in coercive and quelling measures , such as the passage of what the colonials referred to as the intolerable acts in the british parliament , and armed skirmishes which resulted in dissidents being proclaimed rebels . these actions eroded the number of crown loyalists ( tories ) among the colonials and , together with the highly effective propaganda campaign of the patriot leaders , caused an increasing number of colonists to begin agitating for independence from the mother country . in 1775 , with events outpacing communications , the second continental congress began acting as the provisional government . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it was an era of constitution writing—most states were busy at the task—and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution ; a " rulebook " for how the new nation should function . during the war , congress exercised an unprecedented level of political , diplomatic , military and economic authority . it adopted trade restrictions , established and maintained an army , issued fiat money , created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation , the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it . in early 1776 , thomas paine argued in the closing pages of the first edition of common sense that the " custom of nations " demanded a formal declaration of american independence if any european power were to mediate a peace between the americans and great britain . the monarchies of france and spain , in particular , could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch . foreign courts needed to have american grievances laid before them persuasively in a " manifesto " which could also reassure them that the americans would be reliable trading partners . without such a declaration , paine concluded , " the custom of all courts is against us , and will be so , until , by an independence , we take rank with other nations . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beyond improving their existing association , the records of the second continental congress show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations . on june 7 , 1776 , richard henry lee introduced a resolution before the continental congress declaring the colonies independent ; at the same time , he also urged congress to resolve " to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign alliances " and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states . congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the declaration , a model treaty , and the articles of confederation . the declaration announced the states ' entry into the international system ; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states ; and the articles of confederation , which established " a firm league " among the thirteen free and independent states , constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on june 12 , 1776 , a day after appointing the committee of five to prepare a draft of the declaration of independence , the second continental congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 with one representative from each colony to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states . the committee was made up of the following individuals : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the committee met frequently , and chairman john dickinson presented their results to the congress on july 12 , 1776 . afterward , there were long debates on such issues as state sovereignty , the exact powers to be given to congress , whether to have a judiciary , western land claims , and voting procedures . to further complicate work on the constitution , congress was forced to leave philadelphia twice , for baltimore , maryland , in the winter of 1776 , and later for lancaster then york , pennsylvania , in the fall of 1777 , to evade advancing british troops . even so , the committee continued with its work . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the final draft of the articles of confederation and perpetual union was completed on november 15 , 1777 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break consensus was achieved by including language guaranteeing that each state retained its sovereignty , leaving the matter of western land claims in the hands of the individual states , including language stating that votes in congress would be en bloc by state , and establishing a unicameral legislature with limited and clearly delineated powers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the articles of confederation was submitted to the states for ratification in late november 1777 . the first state to ratify was virginia on december 16 , 1777 ; 12 states had ratified the articles by february 1779 , 14 months into the process . the lone holdout , maryland , refused to go along until the landed states , especially virginia , had indicated they were prepared to cede their claims west of the ohio river to the union . it would be two years before the maryland general assembly became satisfied that the various states would follow through , and voted to ratify . during this time , congress observed the articles as its de facto frame of government . maryland finally ratified the articles on february 2 , 1781 . congress was informed of marylands assent on march 1 , and officially proclaimed the articles of confederation to be the law of the land . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the several states ratified the articles of confederation on the following dates : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the articles of confederation contain a preamble , thirteen articles , a conclusion , and a signatory section . the individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the confederations central government . under the articles , the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national congress , which was empowered to make war and peace , negotiate diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries , and to resolve disputes between the states . the document also stipulates that its provisions " shall be inviolably observed by every state " and that " the union shall be perpetual " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break summary of the purpose and content of each of the 13 articles : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break under the articles , congress had the authority to regulate and fund the continental army , but it lacked the power to compel the states to comply with requests for either troops or funding . this left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding , supplies , and even food . further , although the articles enabled the states to present a unified front when dealing with the european powers , as a tool to build a centralized war - making government , they were largely a failure ; historian bruce chadwick wrote : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break phelps wrote : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the continental congress , before the articles were approved , had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life . however congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation , and as the war wound down after the victory at yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor . no progress was made in congress during the winter of 1783–84 . general henry knox , who would later become the first secretary of war under the constitution , blamed the weaknesses of the articles for the inability of the government to fund the army . the army had long been supportive of a strong union . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break knox wrote : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as congress failed to act on the petitions , knox wrote to gouverneur morris , four years before the philadelphia convention was convened , " as the present constitution is so defective , why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so ; that is , to have a convention of the states to form a better constitution . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break once the war had been won , the continental army was largely disbanded . a very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against native american attacks . meanwhile , each of the states had an army ( or militia ) , and 11 of them had navies . the wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met . in 1783 , george washington defused the newburgh conspiracy , but riots by unpaid pennsylvania veterans forced congress to leave philadelphia temporarily . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the congress from time to time during the revolutionary war requisitioned troops from the states . any contributions were voluntary , and in the debates of 1788 , the federalists ( who supported the proposed new constitution ) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally , and contributed when the continental army protected their states interests . the anti - federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the union and contributed to advance its needs . dougherty ( 2009 ) concludes that generally the states ' behavior validated the federalist analysis . this helps explain why the articles of confederation needed reforms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 1783 treaty of paris , which ended hostilities with great britain , languished in congress for several months because too few delegates were present at any one time to constitute a quorum so that it could be ratified . afterward , the problem only got worse as congress had no power to enforce attendance . rarely did more than half of the roughly sixty delegates attend a session of congress at the time , causing difficulties in raising a quorum . the resulting paralysis embarrassed and frustrated many american nationalists , including george washington . many of the most prominent national leaders , such as washington , john adams , john hancock , and benjamin franklin , retired from public life , served as foreign delegates , or held office in state governments ; and for the general public , local government and self - rule seemed quite satisfactory . this served to exacerbate congresss impotence . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break inherent weaknesses in the confederations frame of government also frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy . in 1786 , thomas jefferson , concerned over the failure of congress to fund an american naval force to confront the barbary pirates , wrote in a diplomatic correspondence to james monroe that , " it will be said there is no money in the treasury . there never will be money in the treasury till the confederacy shows its teeth . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break furthermore , the 1786 jay–gardoqui treaty with spain also showed weakness in foreign policy . in this treaty , which was never ratified , the united states was to give up rights to use the mississippi river for 25 years , which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the appalachian mountains . finally , due to the confederations military weakness , it could not compel the british army to leave frontier forts which were on american soil — forts which , in 1783 , the british promised to leave , but which they delayed leaving pending implementation of other provisions such as ending action against loyalists and allowing them to seek compensation . this incomplete british implementation of the treaty of paris would later be resolved by the implementation of jays treaty in 1795 after the federal constitution came into force . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break under the articles of confederation , the central governments power was kept quite limited . the confederation congress could make decisions but lacked enforcement powers . implementation of most decisions , including modifications to the articles , required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break congress was denied any powers of taxation : it could only request money from the states . the states often failed to meet these requests in full , leaving both congress and the continental army chronically short of money . as more money was printed by congress , the continental dollars depreciated . in 1779 , george washington wrote to john jay , who was serving as the president of the continental congress , " that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions . " mr . jay and the congress responded in may by requesting 45million from the states . in an appeal to the states to comply , jay wrote that the taxes were " the price of liberty , the peace , and the safety of yourselves and posterity . " he argued that americans should avoid having it said " that america had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent " or that " her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith . " the states did not respond with any of the money requested from them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break congress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or interstate commerce and , as a result , all of the states maintained control over their own trade policies . the states and the confederation congress both incurred large debts during the revolutionary war , and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the war . some states paid off their war debts and others did not . federal assumption of the states ' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the constitutional convention . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nevertheless , the confederation congress did take two actions with long - lasting impact . the land ordinance of 1785 and northwest ordinance created territorial government , set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units , and set aside land in each township for public use . this system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization , as in europe , and it established the precedent by which the national ( later , federal ) government would be sovereign and expand westward—as opposed to the existing states doing so under their sovereignty . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the land ordinance of 1785 established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the mississippi river . frontier lands were surveyed into the now - familiar squares of land called the township ( 36 square miles ) , the section ( one square mile ) , and the quarter section ( 160 acres ) . this system was carried forward to most of the states west of the mississippi ( excluding areas of texas and california that had already been surveyed and divided up by the spanish empire ) . then , when the homestead act was enacted in 1867 , the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler - farmers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the northwest ordinance of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up northwestern land claims , organized the northwest territory and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states . while it didnt happen under the articles , the land north of the ohio river and west of the ( present ) western border of pennsylvania ceded by massachusetts , connecticut , new york , pennsylvania , and virginia , eventually became the states of : ohio , indiana , illinois , michigan , and wisconsin , and the part of minnesota east of the mississippi river . the northwest ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery . new states admitted to the union in this territory would never be slave states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break no new states were admitted to the union under the articles of confederation . the articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the province of quebec ( referred to as " canada " in the articles ) into the united states if it chose to do so . it did not , and the subsequent constitution carried no such special provision of admission . additionally , ordinances to admit frankland ( later modified to franklin ) , kentucky , and vermont to the union were considered , but none were approved . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break under the articles of confederation , the presiding officer of congress—referred to in many official records as president of the united states in congress assembled—chaired the committee of the states when congress was in recess , and performed other administrative functions . he was not , however , an executive in the way the later president of the united states is a chief executive , since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of congress . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there were 10 presidents of congress under the articles . the first , samuel huntington , had been serving as president of the continental congress since september 28 , 1779 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the peace treaty left the united states independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure . the articles envisioned a permanent confederation but granted to the congress—the only federal institution—little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced . there was no president , no executive agencies , no judiciary , and no tax base . the absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states , which seldom arrived . although historians generally agree that the articles were too weak to hold the fast - growing nation together , they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue , as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by 1783 , with the end of the british blockade , the new nation was regaining its prosperity . however , trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the british and french empires . the ports of the british west indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in british ships . france and spain established similar policies . simultaneously , new manufacturers faced sharp competition from british products which were suddenly available again . political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the revolution . the apparent inability of the congress to redeem the public obligations ( debts ) incurred during the war , or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development , only aggravated a gloomy situation . in 1786–87 , shays ' rebellion , an uprising of dissidents in western massachusetts against the state court system , threatened the stability of state government . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the continental congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency , spawning the expression " not worth a continental " . congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the states . less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784 , although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when john adams went to london in 1785 as the first representative of the united states , he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce . demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty . adams stated it was necessary for the states to confer the power of passing navigation laws to congress , or that the states themselves pass retaliatory acts against great britain . congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws . meanwhile , each state acted individually against great britain to little effect . when other new england states closed their ports to british shipping , connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by 1787 congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping . state legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit . land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the idea of a convention to revise the articles of confederation grew in favor . alexander hamilton realized while serving as washingtons top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual congress . hamilton led a group of like - minded nationalists , won washingtons endorsement , and convened the annapolis convention in 1786 to petition congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in philadelphia to remedy the long - term crisis . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the second continental congress approved the articles for distribution to the states on november 15 , 1777 . a copy was made for each state and one was kept by the congress . on november 28 , the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned , and the cover letter , dated november 17 , had only the signatures of henry laurens and charles thomson , who were the president and secretary to the congress . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the articles , however , were unsigned , and the date was blank . congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the articles on june 27 , 1778 . they ordered a final copy prepared ( the one in the national archives ) , and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on july 9 , 1778 , the prepared copy was ready . they dated it and began to sign . they also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed . on that date , delegates present from new hampshire , massachusetts , rhode island , connecticut , new york , pennsylvania , virginia and south carolina signed the articles to indicate that their states had ratified . new jersey , delaware and maryland could not , since their states had not ratified . north carolina and georgia also were unable to sign that day , since their delegations were absent . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the first signing , some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended . for example , john wentworth of new hampshire added his name on august 8 . john penn was the first of north carolinas delegates to arrive ( on july 10 ) , and the delegation signed the articles on july 21 , 1778 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the other states had to wait until they ratified the articles and notified their congressional delegation . georgia signed on july 24 , new jersey on november 26 , and delaware on february 12 , 1779 . maryland refused to ratify the articles until every state had ceded its western land claims chevalier de la luzerne , french minister to the united states , felt that the articles would help strengthen the american government . in 1780 , when maryland requested france provide naval forces in the chesapeake bay for protection from the british ( who were conducting raids in the lower part of the bay ) , he indicated that french admiral destouches would do what he could but la luzerne also " sharply pressed " maryland to ratify the articles , thus suggesting the two issues were related . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on february 2 , 1781 , the much - awaited decision was taken by the maryland general assembly in annapolis . as the last piece of business during the afternoon session , " among engrossed bills " was " signed and sealed by governor thomas sim lee in the senate chamber , in the presence of the members of both houses an act to empower the delegates of this state in congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation " and perpetual union among the states . the senate then adjourned " to the first monday in august next . " the decision of maryland to ratify the articles was reported to the continental congress on february 12 . the confirmation signing of the articles by the two maryland delegates took place in philadelphia at noon time on march 1 , 1781 , and was celebrated in the afternoon . with these events , the articles were entered into force and the united states of america came into being as a sovereign federal state . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break congress had debated the articles for over a year and a half , and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years . many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates , and some of the signers had only recently arrived . the articles of confederation and perpetual union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the congress at the same time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the signers and the states they represented were : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break roger sherman ( connecticut ) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the united states : the continental association , the united states declaration of independence , the articles of confederation and the united states constitution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break robert morris ( pennsylvania ) signed three of the great state papers of the united states : the united states declaration of independence , the articles of confederation and the united states constitution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break john dickinson ( delaware ) , daniel carroll ( maryland ) and gouverneur morris ( new york ) , along with sherman and robert morris , were the only five people to sign both the articles of confederation and the united states constitution ( gouverneur morris represented pennsylvania when signing the constitution ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break original parchment pages of the articles of confederation , national archives and records administration . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in september 1786 , delegates from five states met at what became known as the annapolis convention to discuss the need for reversing the protectionist interstate trade barriers that each state had erected . at its conclusion , delegates voted to invite all states to a larger convention to be held in philadelphia in 1787 . the confederation congress later endorsed this convention " for the sole and express purpose of revising the articles of confederation " . although the states ' representatives to the constitutional convention in philadelphia were only authorized to amend the articles , delegates held secret , closed - door sessions and wrote a new constitution . the new frame of government gave much more power to the central government , but characterization of the result is disputed . the general goal of the authors was to get close to a republic as defined by the philosophers of the age of enlightenment , while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships . historian forrest mcdonald , using the ideas of james madison from federalist 39 , described the change this way : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in may 1786 , charles pinckney of south carolina proposed that congress revise the articles of confederation . recommended changes included granting congress power over foreign and domestic commerce , and providing means for congress to collect money from state treasuries . unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations , however , and congress failed to reach a consensus . the weakness of the articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states , especially after shays ' rebellion threatened to topple the state government of massachusetts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break historian ralph ketcham commented on the opinions of patrick henry , george mason , and other anti - federalists who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break historians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787 . jillson and wilson ( 1994 ) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms , rules and institutional structures of the congress , and the propensity to divide along sectional lines . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break rakove identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the confederation . the lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power . it could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by rhode island . rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures " stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes , mustering men , and gathering supplies from a war - weary populace . " the second group of factors rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the continental congress confronted after 1783 , especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy . finally , the confederations lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means , thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when the war ended in 1783 , certain special interests had incentives to create a new " merchant state , " much like the british state people had rebelled against . in particular , holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims also , manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods , but competition among states made this impossible without a central government . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break two prominent political leaders in the confederation , john jay of new york and thomas burke of north carolina believed that " the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states , to which the states gave their voluntary consent , and until those obligations were fulfilled , neither nullification of the authority of congress , exercising its due powers , nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to article xiii of the confederation , any alteration had to be approved unanimously : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the articles of this confederation shall be inviolably observed by every state , and the union shall be perpetual ; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them ; unless such alteration be agreed to in a congress of the united states , and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every state . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on the other hand , article vii of the proposed constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states , without unanimity : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ratification of the conventions of nine states , shall be sufficient for the establishment of this constitution between the states so ratifying the same . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time , and remains a topic of scholarly discussion . in 1788 , james madison remarked ( in federalist no . 40 ) that the issue had become moot : " as this objection… has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention , i dismiss it without further observation . " nevertheless , it is a historical and legal question whether opponents of the constitution could have plausibly attacked the constitution on that ground . at the time , there were state legislators who argued that the constitution was not an alteration of the articles of confederation , but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply . moreover , the confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break modern scholars such as francisco forrest martin agree that the articles of confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it , and thus " other states - parties did not have to comply with the articles ' unanimous consent rule " . in contrast , law professor akhil amar suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the articles of confederation and the constitution on this point ; article vi of the confederation specifically allowed side deals among states , and the constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on july 3 , 1788 , the congress received new hampshires all - important ninth ratification of the proposed constitution , thus , according to its terms , establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states . the following day delegates considered a bill to admit kentucky into the union as a sovereign state . the discussion ended with congress making the determination that , in light of this development , it would be " unadvisable " to admit kentucky into the union , as it could do so " under the articles of confederation " only , but not " under the constitution " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by the end of july 1788 , 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new constitution . congress continued to convene under the articles with a quorum until october . on saturday , september 13 , 1788 , the confederation congress voted the resolve to implement the new constitution , and on monday , september 15 published an announcement that the new constitution had been ratified by the necessary nine states , set the first wednesday in january 1789 for appointing electors , set the first wednesday in february 1789 for the presidential electors to meet and vote for a new president , and set the first wednesday of march 1789 as the day " for commencing proceedings " under the new constitution . on that same september 13 , it determined that new york would remain the national capital . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

*********** Article 78: Atlantic Ocean ***********

the atlantic ocean is the second - largest of the worlds five oceans , with an area of about 106460000 km2 . it covers approximately 20 of earths surface and about 29 of its water surface area . it is known to separate the " old world " of africa , europe and asia from the " new world " of the americas in the european perception of the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the atlantic ocean occupies an elongated , s - shaped basin extending longitudinally between europe and africa to the east , and the americas to the west . as one component of the interconnected world ocean , it is connected in the north to the arctic ocean , to the pacific ocean in the southwest , the indian ocean in the southeast , and the southern ocean in the south ( other definitions describe the atlantic as extending southward to antarctica ) . the atlantic ocean is divided in two parts , by the equatorial counter current , with the north ( ern ) atlantic ocean and the south ( ern ) atlantic ocean split at about 8°n . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break scientific explorations of the atlantic include the challenger expedition , the german meteor expedition , columbia universitys lamont–doherty earth observatory and the united states navy hydrographic office . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the oldest known mentions of an " atlantic " sea come from stesichorus around mid - sixth century bc ( sch . 211 ) : ( greek : ; english : ' the atlantic sea ' ; etym . ' sea of atlas ' ) and in the histories of herodotus around 450 bc ( hdt . ) : ( greek : ; english : ' sea of atlas ' or ' the atlantic sea ' ) where the name refers to " the sea beyond the pillars of heracles " which is said to be part of the sea that surrounds all land . in these uses , the name refers to atlas , the titan in greek mythology , who supported the heavens and who later appeared as a frontispiece in medieval maps and also lent his name to modern atlases . on the other hand , to early greek sailors and in ancient greek mythological literature such as the iliad and the odyssey , this all - encompassing ocean was instead known as oceanus , the gigantic river that encircled the world ; in contrast to the enclosed seas well known to the greeks : the mediterranean and the black sea . in contrast , the term " atlantic " originally referred specifically to the atlas mountains in morocco and the sea off the strait of gibraltar and the north african coast . the greek word has been reused by scientists for the huge panthalassa ocean that surrounded the supercontinent pangaea hundreds of millions of years ago . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term " aethiopian ocean " , derived from ancient ethiopia , was applied to the southern atlantic as late as the mid - 19th century . during the age of discovery , the atlantic was also known to english cartographers as the great western ocean . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the pond is a term often used by british and american speakers in reference to the northern atlantic ocean , as a form of meiosis , or ironic understatement . it is used mostly when referring to events or circumstances " on this side of the pond " or " on the other side of the pond " , rather than to discuss the ocean itself . the term dates to 1640 , first appearing in print in pamphlet released during the reign of charles i , and reproduced in 1869 in nehemiah wallingtons historical notices of events occurring chiefly in the reign of charles i , where " great pond " is used in reference to the atlantic ocean by francis windebank , charles is secretary of state . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the international hydrographic organization ( iho ) defined the limits of the oceans and seas in 1953 , but some of these definitions have been revised since then and some are not used by various authorities , institutions , and countries , see for example the cia world factbook . correspondingly , the extent and number of oceans and seas vary . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the atlantic ocean is bounded on the west by north and south america . it connects to the arctic ocean through the denmark strait , greenland sea , norwegian sea and barents sea . to the east , the boundaries of the ocean proper are europe : the strait of gibraltar ( where it connects with the mediterranean sea—one of its marginal seas—and , in turn , the black sea , both of which also touch upon asia ) and africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the southeast , the atlantic merges into the indian ocean . the 20° east meridian , running south from cape agulhas to antarctica defines its border . in the 1953 definition it extends south to antarctica , while in later maps it is bounded at the 60° parallel by the southern ocean . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays , gulfs and seas . these include the baltic sea , black sea , caribbean sea , davis strait , denmark strait , part of the drake passage , gulf of mexico , labrador sea , mediterranean sea , north sea , norwegian sea , almost all of the scotia sea , and other tributary water bodies . including these marginal seas the coast line of the atlantic measures compared to for the pacific . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break including its marginal seas , the atlantic covers an area of or 23 of the global ocean and has a volume of or 23 of the total volume of the earths oceans . excluding its marginal seas , the atlantic covers and has a volume of . the north atlantic covers ( 11 ) and the south atlantic ( 11 ) . the average depth is and the maximum depth , the milwaukee deep in the puerto rico trench , is . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break top large seas : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the bathymetry of the atlantic is dominated by a submarine mountain range called the mid - atlantic ridge ( mar ) . it runs from 87°n or south of the north pole to the subantarctic bouvet island at 54°s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the mar divides the atlantic longitudinally into two halves , in each of which a series of basins are delimited by secondary , transverse ridges . the mar reaches above along most of its length , but is interrupted by larger transform faults at two places : the romanche trench near the equator and the gibbs fracture zone at 53°n . the mar is a barrier for bottom water , but at these two transform faults deep water currents can pass from one side to the other . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the mar rises above the surrounding ocean floor and its rift valley is the divergent boundary between the north american and eurasian plates in the north atlantic and the south american and african plates in the south atlantic . the mar produces basaltic volcanoes in eyjafjallajökull , iceland , and pillow lava on the ocean floor . the depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than in most places , while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the mar is intersected by two perpendicular ridges : the azores–gibraltar transform fault , the boundary between the nubian and eurasian plates , intersects the mar at the azores triple junction , on either side of the azores microplate , near the 40°n . a much vaguer , nameless boundary , between the north american and south american plates , intersects the mar near or just north of the fifteen - twenty fracture zone , approximately at 16°n . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 1870s , the challenger expedition discovered parts of what is now known as the mid - atlantic ridge , or : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the remainder of the ridge was discovered in the 1920s by the german meteor expedition using echo - sounding equipment . the exploration of the mar in the 1950s led to the general acceptance of seafloor spreading and plate tectonics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most of the mar runs under water but where it reaches the surfaces it has produced volcanic islands . while nine of these have collectively been nominated a world heritage site for their geological value , four of them are considered of " outstanding universal value " based on their cultural and natural criteria : þingvellir , iceland ; landscape of the pico island vineyard culture , portugal ; gough and inaccessible islands , united kingdom ; and brazilian atlantic islands : fernando de noronha and atol das rocas reserves , brazil . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break continental shelves in the atlantic are wide off newfoundland , southernmost south america , and north - eastern europe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the western atlantic carbonate platforms dominate large areas , for example , the blake plateau and bermuda rise . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the atlantic is surrounded by passive margins except at a few locations where active margins form deep trenches : the puerto rico trench ( maximum depth ) in the western atlantic and south sandwich trench in the south atlantic . there are numerous submarine canyons off north - eastern north america , western europe , and north - western africa . some of these canyons extend along the continental rises and farther into the abyssal plains as deep - sea channels . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1922 , a historic moment in cartography and oceanography occurred . the uss stewart used a navy sonic depth finder to draw a continuous map across the bed of the atlantic . this involved little guesswork because the idea of sonar is straightforward with pulses being sent from the vessel , which bounce off the ocean floor , then return to the vessel . the deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps , abyssal plains , trenches , seamounts , basins , plateaus , canyons , and some guyots . various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11 of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the mean depth between 60°n and 60°s is , or close to the average for the global ocean , with a modal depth between . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the south atlantic the walvis ridge and rio grande rise form barriers to ocean currents . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the laurentian abyss is found off the eastern coast of canada . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break surface water temperatures , which vary with latitude , current systems , and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy , range from below - 2 c to over 30 maximum temperatures occur north of the equator , and minimum values are found in the polar regions . in the middle latitudes , the area of maximum temperature variations , values may vary by 7 c - change . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from october to june the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the labrador sea , denmark strait , and baltic sea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the coriolis effect circulates north atlantic water in a clockwise direction , whereas south atlantic water circulates counter - clockwise . the south tides in the atlantic ocean are semi - diurnal ; that is , two high tides occur every 24 lunar hours . in latitudes above 40° north some east–west oscillation , known as the north atlantic oscillation , occurs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on average , the atlantic is the saltiest major ocean ; surface water salinity in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand ( 3–3 ) by mass and varies with latitude and season . evaporation , precipitation , river inflow and sea ice melting influence surface salinity values . although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator ( because of heavy tropical rainfall ) , in general , the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter . maximum salinity values occur at about 25° north and south , in subtropical regions with low rainfall and high evaporation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the high surface salinity in the atlantic , on which the atlantic thermohaline circulation is dependent , is maintained by two processes : the agulhas leakage / rings , which brings salty indian ocean waters into the south atlantic , and the " atmospheric bridge " , which evaporates subtropical atlantic waters and exports it to the pacific . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the atlantic ocean consists of four major , upper water masses with distinct temperature and salinity . the atlantic subarctic upper water in the northernmost north atlantic is the source for subarctic intermediate water and north atlantic intermediate water . north atlantic central water can be divided into the eastern and western north atlantic central water since the western part is strongly affected by the gulf stream and therefore the upper layer is closer to underlying fresher subpolar intermediate water . the eastern water is saltier because of its proximity to mediterranean water . north atlantic central water flows into south atlantic central water at 15°n . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are five intermediate waters : four low - salinity waters formed at subpolar latitudes and one high - salinity formed through evaporation . arctic intermediate water , flows from north to become the source for north atlantic deep water south of the greenland - scotland sill . these two intermediate waters have different salinity in the western and eastern basins . the wide range of salinities in the north atlantic is caused by the asymmetry of the northern subtropical gyre and the large number of contributions from a wide range of sources : labrador sea , norwegian - greenland sea , mediterranean , and south atlantic intermediate water . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the north atlantic deep water ( nadw ) is a complex of four water masses , two that form by deep convection in the open ocean— classical and upper labrador sea water— and two that form from the inflow of dense water across the greenland - iceland - scotland sill— denmark strait and iceland - scotland overflow water . along its path across earth the composition of the nadw is affected by other water masses , especially antarctic bottom water and mediterranean overflow water . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the nadw is fed by a flow of warm shallow water into the northern north atlantic which is responsible for the anomalous warm climate in europe . changes in the formation of nadw have been linked to global climate changes in the past . since man - made substances were introduced into the environment , the path of the nadw can be traced throughout its course by measuring tritium and radiocarbon from nuclear weapon tests in the 1960s and cfcs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the clockwise warm - water north atlantic gyre occupies the northern atlantic , and the counter - clockwise warm - water south atlantic gyre appears in the southern atlantic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the north atlantic , surface circulation is dominated by three inter - connected currents : the gulf stream which flows north - east from the north american coast at cape hatteras ; the north atlantic current , a branch of the gulf stream which flows northward from the grand banks ; and the subpolar front , an extension of the north atlantic current , a wide , vaguely defined region separating the subtropical gyre from the subpolar gyre . this system of currents transport warm water into the north atlantic , without which temperatures in the north atlantic and europe would plunge dramatically . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break north of the north atlantic gyre , the cyclonic north atlantic subpolar gyre plays a key role in climate variability . it is governed by ocean currents from marginal seas and regional topography , rather than being steered by wind , both in the deep ocean and at sea level . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the subpolar gyre forms an important part of the global thermohaline circulation . its eastern portion includes eddying branches of the north atlantic current which transport warm , saline waters from the subtropics to the north - eastern atlantic . there this water is cooled during winter and forms return currents that merge along the eastern continental slope of greenland where they form an intense ( 40–50sv ) current which flows around the continental margins of the labrador sea . a third of this water becomes part of the deep portion of the north atlantic deep water ( nadw ) . the nadw , in its turn , feeds the meridional overturning circulation ( moc ) , the northward heat transport of which is threatened by anthropogenic climate change . large variations in the subpolar gyre on a decade - century scale , associated with the north atlantic oscillation , are especially pronounced in labrador sea water , the upper layers of the moc . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the south atlantic is dominated by the anti - cyclonic southern subtropical gyre . the south atlantic central water originates in this gyre , while antarctic intermediate water originates in the upper layers of the circumpolar region , near the drake passage and the falkland islands . both these currents receive some contribution from the indian ocean . on the african east coast , the small cyclonic angola gyre lies embedded in the large subtropical gyre . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the southern subtropical gyre is partly masked by a wind - induced ekman layer . the residence time of the gyre is 4–8years . north atlantic deep water flows southward below the thermocline of the subtropical gyre . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the sargasso sea in the western north atlantic can be defined as the area where two species of sargassum ( s . fluitans and natans ) float , an area wide and encircled by the gulf stream , north atlantic drift , and north equatorial current . this population of seaweed probably originated from tertiary ancestors on the european shores of the former tethys ocean and has , if so , maintained itself by vegetative growth , floating in the ocean for millions of years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other species endemic to the sargasso sea include the sargassum fish , a predator with algae - like appendages which hovers motionless among the sargassum . fossils of similar fishes have been found in fossil bays of the former tethys ocean , in what is now the carpathian region , that were similar to the sargasso sea . it is possible that the population in the sargasso sea migrated to the atlantic as the tethys closed at the end of the miocene around 17ma . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the location of the spawning ground for european eels remained unknown for decades . in the early 19th century it was discovered that the southern sargasso sea is the spawning ground for both the european and american eel and that the former migrate more than and the latter . ocean currents such as the gulf stream transport eel larvae from the sargasso sea to foraging areas in north america , europe , and northern africa . recent but disputed research suggests that eels possibly use earths magnetic field to navigate through the ocean both as larvae and as adults . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds . because of the oceans great capacity to store and release heat , maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates . precipitation can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation . climatic zones vary with latitude ; the warmest zones stretch across the atlantic north of the equator . the coldest zones are in high latitudes , with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice . ocean currents influence the climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions . the winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the gulf stream and its northern extension towards europe , the north atlantic drift is thought to have at least some influence on climate . for example , the gulf stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern north america , keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas . the gulf stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the florida peninsula . in the higher latitudes , the north atlantic drift , warms the atmosphere over the oceans , keeping the british isles and north - western europe mild and cloudy , and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude . the cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern canada ( the grand banks of newfoundland area ) and africas north - western coast . in general , winds transport moisture and air over land areas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break every winter , the icelandic low produces frequent storms icebergs are common from early february to the end of july across the shipping lanes near the grand banks of newfoundland . the ice season is longer in the polar regions , but there is little shipping in those areas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hurricanes are a hazard in the western parts of the north atlantic during the summer and autumn . due to a consistently strong wind shear and a weak intertropical convergence zone , south atlantic tropical cyclones are rare . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the atlantic ocean is underlain mostly by dense mafic oceanic crust made up of basalt and gabbro and overlain by fine clay , silt and siliceous ooze on the abyssal plain . the continental margins and continental shelf mark lower density , but greater thickness felsic continental rock that is often much older than that of the seafloor . the oldest oceanic crust in the atlantic is up to 145 million years and situated off the west coast of africa and east coast of north america , or on either side of the south atlantic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in many places , the continental shelf and continental slope are covered in thick sedimentary layers . for instance , on the north american side of the ocean , large carbonate deposits formed in warm shallow waters such as florida and the bahamas , while coarse river outwash sands and silt are common in shallow shelf areas like the georges bank . coarse sand , boulders , and rocks were transported into some areas , such as off the coast of nova scotia or the gulf of maine during the pleistocene ice ages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the break - up of pangaea began in the central atlantic , between north america and northwest africa , where rift basins opened during the late triassic and early jurassic . this period also saw the first stages of the uplift of the atlas mountains . the exact timing is controversial with estimates ranging from 200 to 170ma . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the opening of the atlantic ocean coincided with the initial break - up of the supercontinent pangaea , both of which were initiated by the eruption of the central atlantic magmatic province ( camp ) , one of the most extensive and voluminous large igneous provinces in earths history associated with the triassic–jurassic extinction event , one of earths major extinction events . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break theoliitic dikes , sills , and lava flows from the camp eruption at 200ma have been found in west africa , eastern north america , and northern south america . the extent of the volcanism has been estimated to of which covered what is now northern and central brazil . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the formation of the central american isthmus closed the central american seaway at the end of the pliocene 2ma ago . the formation of the isthmus resulted in the migration and extinction of many land - living animals , known as the great american interchange , but the closure of the seaway resulted in a " great american schism " as it affected ocean currents , salinity , and temperatures in both the atlantic and pacific . marine organisms on both sides of the isthmus became isolated and either diverged or went extinct . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break geologically , the northern atlantic is the area delimited to the south by two conjugate margins , newfoundland and iberia , and to the north by the arctic eurasian basin . the opening of the northern atlantic closely followed the margins of its predecessor , the iapetus ocean , and spread from the central atlantic in six stages : iberia–newfoundland , porcupine–north america , eurasia–greenland , eurasia–north america . active and inactive spreading systems in this area are marked by the interaction with the iceland hotspot . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break seafloor spreading led to the extension of the crust and formations of troughs and sedimentary basins . the rockall trough opened between 105 and 84 million years ago although along the rift failed along with one leading into the bay of biscay . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break spreading began opening the labrador sea around 61 million years ago , continuing until 36 million years ago . geologists distinguish two magmatic phases . one from 62 to 58 million years ago predates the separation of greenland from northern europe while the second from 56 to 52 million years ago happened as the separation occurred . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break iceland began to form 62 million years ago due to a particularly concentrated mantle plume . large quantities of basalt erupted at this time period are found on baffin island , greenland , the faroe islands , and scotland , with ash falls in western europe acting as a stratigraphic marker . the opening of the north atlantic caused significant uplift of continental crust along the coast . for instance , in spite of 7km thick basalt , gunnbjorn field in east greenland is the highest point on the island , elevated enough that it exposes older mesozoic sedimentary rocks at its base , similar to old lava fields above sedimentary rocks in the uplifted hebrides of western scotland . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the north atlantic ocean contains about 810 seamounts , most of them situated along the mid - atlantic ridge . the ospar database ( convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north - east atlantic ) mentions 104 seamounts : 74 within the national exclusive economic zone . of these seamounts , 46 are located close to the iberian peninsula . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break west gondwana ( south america and africa ) broke up in the early cretaceous to form the south atlantic . the apparent fit between the coastlines of the two continents was noted on the first maps that included the south atlantic and it was also the subject of the first computer - assisted plate tectonic reconstructions in 1965 . this magnificent fit , however , has since then proven problematic and later reconstructions have introduced various deformation zones along the shorelines to accommodate the northward - propagating break - up . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break geologically the south atlantic can be divided into four segments : equatorial segment , from 10°n to the romanche fracture zone ( rfz ) ; central segment , from rfz to florianopolis fracture zone ( ffz , north of walvis ridge and rio grande rise ) ; southern segment , from ffz to the agulhas - falkland fracture zone ( affz ) ; and falkland segment , south of affz . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the southern segment the early cretaceous ( 133–130ma ) intensive magmatism of the paraná–etendeka large igneous province produced by the tristan hotspot resulted in an estimated volume of . it covered an area of in brazil , paraguay , and uruguay and in africa . dyke swarms in brazil , angola , eastern paraguay , and namibia , however , suggest the lip originally covered a much larger area and also indicate failed rifts in all these areas . associated offshore basaltic flows reach as far south as the falkland islands and south africa . traces of magmatism in both offshore and onshore basins in the central and southern segments have been dated to 147–49ma with two peaks between 143 and 121ma and 90–60ma . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the falkland segment rifting began with dextral movements between the patagonia and colorado sub - plates between the early jurassic ( 190ma ) and the early cretaceous ( 126ma ) . around 150ma sea - floor spreading propagated northward into the southern segment . no later than 130ma rifting had reached the walvis ridge–rio grande rise . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the central segment rifting started to break africa in two by opening the benue trough around 118ma . rifting in the central segment , however , coincided with the cretaceous normal superchron ( also known as the cretaceous quiet period ) , a 40ma period without magnetic reversals , which makes it difficult to date sea - floor spreading in this segment . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the equatorial segment is the last phase of the break - up , but , because it is located on the equator , magnetic anomalies cannot be used for dating . various estimates date the propagation of sea - floor spreading in this segment to the period 120–96ma . this final stage , nevertheless , coincided with or resulted in the end of continental extension in africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break about 50ma the opening of the drake passage resulted from a change in the motions and separation rate of the south american and antarctic plates . first small ocean basins opened and a shallow gateway appeared during the middle eocene . 34–30ma a deeper seaway developed , followed by an eocene–oligocene climatic deterioration and the growth of the antarctic ice sheet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an embryonic subduction margin is potentially developing west of gibraltar . the gibraltar arc in the western mediterranean is migrating westward into the central atlantic where it joins the converging african and eurasian plates . together these three tectonic forces are slowly developing into a new subduction system in the eastern atlantic basin . meanwhile , the scotia arc and caribbean plate in the western atlantic basin are eastward - propagating subduction systems that might , together with the gibraltar system , represent the beginning of the closure of the atlantic ocean and the final stage of the atlantic wilson cycle . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break humans evolved in africa ; first by diverging from other apes around 7mya ; then developing stone tools around 2mya ; to finally evolve as modern humans around 200kya . the earliest evidence for the complex behavior associated with this behavioral modernity has been found in the greater cape floristic region ( gcfr ) along the coast of south africa . during the latest glacial stages , the now - submerged plains of the agulhas bank were exposed above sea level , extending the south african coastline farther south by hundreds of kilometers . a small population of modern humans— probably fewer than a thousand reproducing individuals— survived glacial maxima by exploring the high diversity offered by these palaeo - agulhas plains . the gcfr is delimited to the north by the cape fold belt and the limited space south of it resulted in the development of social networks out of which complex stone age technologies emerged . human history thus begins on the coasts of south africa where the atlantic benguela upwelling and indian ocean agulhas current meet to produce an intertidal zone on which shellfish , fur seal , fish and sea birds provided the necessary protein sources . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the african origin of this modern behaviour is evidenced by 70000 years - old engravings from blombos cave , south africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) studies indicate that 80–60000 years ago a major demographic expansion within africa , derived from a single , small population , coincided with the emergence of behavioral complexity and the rapid mis5–4 environmental changes . this group of people not only expanded over the whole of africa , but also started to disperse out of africa into asia , europe , and australasia around 65000 years ago and quickly replaced the archaic humans in these regions . during the last glacial maximum ( lgm ) 20000 years ago humans had to abandon their initial settlements along the european north atlantic coast and retreat to the mediterranean . following rapid climate changes at the end of the lgm this region was repopulated by magdalenian culture . other hunter - gatherers followed in waves interrupted by large - scale hazards such as the laacher see volcanic eruption , the inundation of doggerland ( now the north sea ) , and the formation of the baltic sea . the european coasts of the north atlantic were permanently populated about 9–8 thousand years ago . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this human dispersal left abundant traces along the coasts of the atlantic ocean . 50kya - old , deeply stratified shell middens found in ysterfontein on the western coast of south africa are associated with the middle stone age ( msa ) . the msa population was small and dispersed and the rate of their reproduction and exploitation was less intense than those of later generations . while their middens resemble 12–11kya - old late stone age ( lsa ) middens found on every inhabited continent , the 50–45kya - old enkapune ya muto in kenya probably represents the oldest traces of the first modern humans to disperse out of africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the same development can be seen in europe . in la riera cave ( 23–13kya ) in asturias , spain , only some 26600 molluscs were deposited over 10kya . in contrast , 8–7kya - old shell middens in portugal , denmark , and brazil generated thousands of tons of debris and artefacts . the ertebølle middens in denmark , for example , accumulated of shell deposits representing some 50 million molluscs over only a thousand years . this intensification in the exploitation of marine resources has been described as accompanied by new technologies— such as boats , harpoons , and fish - hooks— because many caves found in the mediterranean and on the european atlantic coast have increased quantities of marine shells in their upper levels and reduced quantities in their lower . the earliest exploitation , however , took place on the now submerged shelves , and most settlements now excavated were then located several kilometers from these shelves . the reduced quantities of shells in the lower levels can represent the few shells that were exported inland . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the lgm the laurentide ice sheet covered most of northern north america while beringia connected siberia to alaska . in 1973 , late american geoscientist paul martin proposed a " blitzkrieg " colonization of the americas by which clovis hunters migrated into north america around 13000 years ago in a single wave through an ice - free corridor in the ice sheet and " spread southward explosively , briefly attaining a density sufficiently large to overkill much of their prey . " others later proposed a " three - wave " migration over the bering land bridge . these hypotheses remained the long - held view regarding the settlement of the americas , a view challenged by more recent archaeological discoveries : the oldest archaeological sites in the americas have been found in south america ; sites in north - east siberia report virtually no human presence there during the lgm ; and most clovis artefacts have been found in eastern north america along the atlantic coast . furthermore , colonisation models based on mtdna , ydna , and atdna data respectively support neither the " blitzkrieg " nor the " three - wave " hypotheses but they also deliver mutually ambiguous results . contradictory data from archaeology and genetics will most likely deliver future hypotheses that will , eventually , confirm each other . a proposed route across the pacific to south america could explain early south american finds and another hypothesis proposes a northern path , through the canadian arctic and down the north american atlantic coast . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break early settlements across the atlantic have been suggested by alternative theories , ranging from purely hypothetical to mostly disputed , including the solutrean hypothesis and some of the pre - columbian trans - oceanic contact theories . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the norse settlement of the faroe islands and iceland began during the 9th and 10th centuries . a settlement on greenland was established before 1000ce , but contact with it was lost in 1409 and it was finally abandoned during the early little ice age . this setback was caused by a range of factors : an unsustainable economy resulted in erosion and denudation , while conflicts with the local inuit resulted in the failure to adapt their arctic technologies ; a colder climate resulted in starvation , and the colony got economically marginalized as the great plague and barbary pirates harvested its victims on iceland in the 15th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break iceland was initially settled 865–930ce following a warm period when winter temperatures hovered around which made farming favorable at high latitudes . this did not last , however , and temperatures quickly dropped ; at 1080ce summer temperatures had reached a maximum of . the landnámabók ( book of settlement ) records disastrous famines during the first century of settlement— " men ate foxes and ravens " and " the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs " — and by the early 1200s hay had to be abandoned for short - season crops such as barley . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break christopher columbus reached the americas in 1492 under spanish flag . six years later vasco da gama reached india under the portuguese flag , by navigating south around the cape of good hope , thus proving that the atlantic and indian oceans are connected . in 1500 , in his voyage to india following vasco da gama , pedro alvares cabral reached brazil , taken by the currents of the south atlantic gyre . following these explorations , spain and portugal quickly conquered and colonized large territories in the new world and forced the amerindian population into slavery in order to explore the vast quantities of silver and gold they found . spain and portugal monopolized this trade in order to keep other european nations out , but conflicting interests nevertheless led to a series of spanish - portuguese wars . a peace treaty mediated by the pope divided the conquered territories into spanish and portuguese sectors while keeping other colonial powers away . england , france , and the dutch republic enviously watched the spanish and portuguese wealth grow and allied themselves with pirates such as henry mainwaring and alexandre exquemelin . they could explore the convoys leaving the americas because prevailing winds and currents made the transport of heavy metals slow and predictable . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the colonies of the americas , depredation , smallpox and others diseases , and slavery quickly reduced the indigenous population of the americas to the extent that the atlantic slave trade had to be introduced to replace them— a trade that became the norm and an integral part of the colonization . between the 15th century and 1888 , when brazil became the last part of the americas to end the slave trade , an estimated ten million africans were exported as slaves , most of them destined for agricultural labour . the slave trade was officially abolished in the british empire and the united states in 1808 , and slavery itself was abolished in the british empire in 1838 and in the united states in 1865 after the civil war . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from columbus to the industrial revolution trans - atlantic trade , including colonialism and slavery , became crucial for western europe . for european countries with direct access to the atlantic ( including britain , france , the netherlands , portugal , and spain ) 1500–1800 was a period of sustained growth during which these countries grew richer than those in eastern europe and asia . colonialism evolved as part of the trans - atlantic trade , but this trade also strengthened the position of merchant groups at the expense of monarchs . growth was more rapid in non - absolutist countries , such as britain and the netherlands , and more limited in absolutist monarchies , such as portugal , spain , and france , where profit mostly or exclusively benefited the monarchy and its allies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break trans - atlantic trade also resulted in increasing urbanization : in european countries facing the atlantic , urbanization grew from 8 in 1300 , 10 in 1500 , to 24 in 1850 ; in other european countries from 10 in 1300 , 11 in 1500 , to 17 in 1850 . likewise , gdp doubled in atlantic countries but rose by only 30 in the rest of europe . by end of the 17th century , the volume of the trans - atlantic trade had surpassed that of the mediterranean trade . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the atlantic ocean became the scene of one of the longest continuous naval military camapaigns throughout world war ii , from 1939 to 1945 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries . besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes , the atlantic offers abundant petroleum deposits in the sedimentary rocks of the continental shelves . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the atlantic harbors petroleum and gas fields , fish , marine mammals ( seals and whales ) , sand and gravel aggregates , placer deposits , polymetallic nodules , and precious stones . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gold deposits are a mile or two under water on the ocean floor , however , the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through . currently , there is no cost - effective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make a profit . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills , marine debris , and the incineration of toxic wastes at sea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the shelves of the atlantic hosts one of the worlds richest fishing resources . the most productive areas include the grand banks of newfoundland , the scotian shelf , georges bank off cape cod , the bahama banks , the waters around iceland , the irish sea , the bay of fundy , the dogger bank of the north sea , and the falkland banks . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break fisheries have , however , undergone significant changes since the 1950s and global catches can now be divided into three groups of which only two are observed in the atlantic : fisheries in the eastern central and south - west atlantic oscillate around a globally stable value , the rest of the atlantic is in overall decline following historical peaks . the third group , " continuously increasing trend since 1950 " , is only found in the indian ocean and western pacific . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the north - east atlantic total catches decreased between the mid - 1970s and the 1990s and reached 8 million tons in 2013 . blue whiting reached a 2 million tons peak in 2004 but was down to 628000 tons in 2013 . recovery plans for cod , sole , and plaice have reduced mortality in these species . arctic cod reached its lowest levels in the 1960s–1980s but is now recovered . arctic saithe and haddock are considered fully fished ; sand eel is overfished as was capelin which has now recovered to fully fished . limited data makes the state of redfishes and deep - water species difficult to assess but most likely they remain vulnerable to overfishing . stocks of northern shrimp and norwegian lobster are in good condition . in the north - east atlantic 21 of stocks are considered overfished . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the north - west atlantic landings have decreased from 4 million tons in the early 1970s to 1 million tons in 2013 . during the 21st century some species have shown weak signs of recovery , including greenland halibut , yellowtail flounder , atlantic halibut , haddock , spiny dogfish , while other stocks shown no such signs , including cod , witch flounder , and redfish . stocks of invertebrates , in contrast , remain at record levels of abundance . 31 of stocks are overfished in the north - west atlantic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1497 , john cabot became the first western european since the vikings to explore mainland north america and one of his major discoveries was the abundant resources of atlantic cod off newfoundland . referred to as " newfoundland currency " this discovery yielded some 200million tons of fish over five centuries . in the late 19th and early 20th centuries new fisheries started to exploit haddock , mackerel , and lobster . from the 1950s to the 1970s the introduction of european and asian distant - water fleets in the area dramatically increased the fishing capacity and the number of exploited species . it also expanded the exploited areas from near - shore to the open sea and to great depths to include deep - water species such as redfish , greenland halibut , witch flounder , and grenadiers . overfishing in the area was recognised as early as the 1960s but , because this was occurring on international waters , it took until the late 1970s before any attempts to regulate was made . in the early 1990s , this finally resulted in the collapse of the atlantic northwest cod fishery . the population of a number of deep - sea fishes also collapsed in the process , including american plaice , redfish , and greenland halibut , together with flounder and grenadier . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the eastern central atlantic small pelagic fishes constitute about 50 of landings with sardine reaching 0–1 million tons per year . pelagic fish stocks are considered fully fished or overfished , with sardines south of cape bojador the notable exception . almost half of the stocks are fished at biologically unsustainable levels . total catches have been fluctuating since the 1970s ; reaching 3 million tons in 2013 or slightly less than the peak production in 2010 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the western central atlantic , catches have been decreasing since 2000 and reached 1 million tons in 2013 . the most important species in the area , gulf menhaden , reached a million tons in the mid - 1980s but only half a million tons in 2013 and is now considered fully fished . round sardinella was an important species in the 1990s but is now considered overfished . groupers and snappers are overfished and northern brown shrimp and american cupped oyster are considered fully fished approaching overfished . 44 of stocks are being fished at unsustainable levels . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the south - east atlantic catches have decreased from 3 million tons in the early 1970s to 1 million tons in 2013 . horse mackerel and hake are the most important species , together representing almost half of the landings . off south africa and namibia deep - water hake and shallow - water cape hake have recovered to sustainable levels since regulations were introduced in 2006 and the states of southern african pilchard and anchovy have improved to fully fished in 2013 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the south - west atlantic , a peak was reached in the mid - 1980s and catches now fluctuate between 1 and 2 million tons . the most important species , the argentine shortfin squid , which reached half a million tons in 2013 or half the peak value , is considered fully fished to overfished . another important species was the brazilian sardinella , with a production of 100000 tons in 2013 it is now considered overfished . half the stocks in this area are being fished at unsustainable levels : whiteheads round herring has not yet reached fully fished but cunene horse mackerel is overfished . the sea snail perlemoen abalone is targeted by illegal fishing and remain overfished . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break endangered marine species include the manatee , seals , sea lions , turtles , and whales . drift net fishing can kill dolphins , albatrosses and other seabirds ( petrels , auks ) , hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles . the biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste . the excess of oxygen - depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break marine debris , which is also known as marine litter , describes human - created waste floating in a body of water . oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines , frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter . the north atlantic garbage patch is estimated to be hundreds of kilometers across in size . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other pollution concerns include agricultural and municipal waste . municipal pollution comes from the eastern united states , southern brazil , and eastern argentina ; oil pollution in the caribbean sea , gulf of mexico , lake maracaibo , mediterranean sea , and north sea ; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the baltic sea , north sea , and mediterranean sea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a usaf c - 124 aircraft from dover air force base , delaware was carrying three nuclear bombs over the atlantic ocean when it experienced a loss of power . for their own safety , the crew jettisoned two nuclear bombs , which were never recovered . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break north atlantic hurricane activity has increased over past decades because of increased sea surface temperature ( sst ) at tropical latitudes , changes that can be attributed to either the natural atlantic multidecadal oscillation ( amo ) or to anthropogenic climate change . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a 2005 report indicated that the atlantic meridional overturning circulation ( amoc ) slowed down by 30 between 1957 and 2004 . if the amo were responsible for sst variability , the amoc would have increased in strength , which is apparently not the case . furthermore , it is clear from statistical analyses of annual tropical cyclones that these changes do not display multidecadal cyclicity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ocean mixed layer plays an important role in heat storage over seasonal and decadal time - scales , whereas deeper layers are affected over millennia and have a heat capacity about 50 times that of the mixed layer . this heat uptake provides a time - lag for climate change but it also results in thermal expansion of the oceans which contributes to sea level rise . 21st - century global warming will probably result in an equilibrium sea - level rise five times greater than today , whilst melting of glaciers , including that of the greenland ice - sheet , expected to have virtually no effect during the 21st century , will probably result in a sea - level rise of 3–6m over a millennium . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

in das wesen der philosophie , shows a large debt to schopenhauer . like his great forebear , dilthey believed that philosophy had first and foremost an ethical function , that its main purpose was to address ' the puzzle of the world ' . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arthur schopenhauer ( , ; 22 february 1788– 21 september 1860 ) was a german philosopher . he is best known for his 1818 work the world as will and representation ( expanded in 1844 ) , which characterizes the phenomenal world as the product of a blind noumenal will . building on the transcendental idealism of immanuel kant , schopenhauer developed an atheistic metaphysical and ethical system that rejected the contemporaneous ideas of german idealism . he was among the first thinkers in western philosophy to share and affirm significant tenets of indian philosophy , such as asceticism , denial of the self , and the notion of the world - as - appearance . his work has been described as an exemplary manifestation of philosophical pessimism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break though his work failed to garner substantial attention during his lifetime , schopenhauer had a posthumous impact across various disciplines , including philosophy , literature , and science . his writing on aesthetics , morality , and psychology have influenced many thinkers and artists . those who have cited his influence include philosophers emil cioran , friedrich nietzsche and ludwig wittgenstein , scientists erwin schrödinger and albert einstein , psychoanalysts sigmund freud and carl jung , writers leo tolstoy , herman melville , thomas mann , hermann hesse , machado de assis , jorge luis borges , marcel proust and samuel beckett , and composers richard wagner , and gustav mahler . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arthur schopenhauer was born on february 22 , 1788 , in danzig ( then part of the polish–lithuanian commonwealth ; present - day gdańsk , poland ) on heiligegeistgasse ( present day św . ducha 47 ) , the son of johanna schopenhauer ( née trosiener ; 1766–1838 ) and heinrich floris schopenhauer ( 1747–1805 ) , both descendants of wealthy german - dutch patrician families . neither of them was very religious ; both supported the french revolution , and were republicans , cosmopolitans and anglophiles . when danzig became part of prussia in 1793 , heinrich moved to hamburg—a free city with a republican constitution . his firm continued trading in danzig where most of their extended families remained . adele , arthurs only sibling , was born on july 12 , 1797 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1797 , arthur was sent to le havre to live with the family of his fathers business associate , grégoire de blésimaire . he seemed to enjoy his two - year stay there , learning to speak french and fostering a life - long friendship with jean anthime grégoire de blésimaire . as early as 1799 , arthur started playing the flute . in 1803 , he accompanied his parents on a european tour of holland , britain , france , switzerland , austria and prussia . viewed as primarily a pleasure tour , heinrich used the opportunity to visit some of his business associates abroad . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break heinrich offered arthur a choice : he could stay at home and start preparations for university , or he could travel with them and continue his merchant education . arthur chose to travel with them . he deeply regretted his choice later because the merchant training was very tedious . he spent twelve weeks of the tour attending school in wimbledon , where he was disillusioned by strict and intellectually shallow anglican religiosity . he continued to sharply criticize anglican religiosity later in life despite his general anglophilia . he was also under pressure from his father , who became very critical of his educational results . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1805 , heinrich drowned in a canal near their home in hamburg . although it was possible that his death was accidental , his wife and son believed that it was suicide . he was prone to anxiety and depression ; each becoming more pronounced later in his life . heinrich had become so fussy , even his wife started to doubt his mental health . " there was , in the fathers life , some dark and vague source of fear which later made him hurl himself to his death from the attic of his house in hamburg . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arthur showed similar moodiness during his youth and often acknowledged that he inherited it from his father . there were other instances of serious mental health history on his fathers side of the family . despite his hardship , schopenhauer liked his father and later referred to him in a positive light . heinrich schopenhauer left the family with a significant inheritance that was split in three among johanna and the children . arthur schopenhauer was entitled to control of his part when he reached the age of majority . he invested it conservatively in government bonds and earned annual interest that was more than double the salary of a university professor . after quitting his merchant apprenticeship , with some encouragement from his mother , he dedicated himself to studies at the ernestine gymnasium , gotha , in saxe - gotha - altenburg . while there , he also enjoyed social life among the local nobility , spending large amounts of money , which deeply concerned his frugal mother . he left the gymnasium after writing a satirical poem about one of the schoolmasters . although arthur claimed that he left voluntarily , his mothers letter indicates that he may have been expelled . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arthur spent two years as a merchant in honor of his dead father . during this time , he had doubts about being able to start a new life as a scholar . most of his prior education was as a practical merchant and he had trouble learning latin ; a prerequisite for an academic career . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break his mother moved away , with her daughter adele , to weimar—then the centre of german literature—to enjoy social life among writers and artists . arthur and his mother did not part on good terms in one letter , she wrote : " you are unbearable and burdensome , and very hard to live with ; all your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit , and made useless to the world simply because you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people . " his mother , johanna , was generally described as vivacious and sociable . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arthur moved to hamburg to live with his friend jean anthime , who was also studying to become a merchant . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he moved to weimar but did not live with his mother , who even tried to discourage him from coming by explaining that they would not get along very well . their relationship deteriorated even further due to their temperamental differences . he accused his mother of being financially irresponsible , flirtatious and seeking to remarry , which he considered an insult to his fathers memory . his mother , while professing her love to him , criticized him sharply for being moody , tactless , and argumentative , and urged him to improve his behavior so that he would not alienate people . schopenhauer was also captivated by the beautiful karoline jagemann , mistress of karl august , grand duke of saxe - weimar - eisenach , and he wrote to her his only known love poem . despite his later celebration of asceticism and negative views of sexuality , schopenhauer occasionally had sexual affairs—usually with women of lower social status , such as servants , actresses , and sometimes even paid prostitutes . in a letter to his friend anthime he claims that such affairs continued even in his mature age and admits that he had two out - of - wedlock daughters ( born in 1819 and 1836 ) , both of whom died in infancy . in their youthful correspondence arthur and anthime were somewhat boastful and competitive about their sexual exploits—but schopenhauer seemed aware that women usually did not find him very charming or physically attractive , and his desires often remained unfulfilled . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he left weimar to become a student at the university of göttingen in 1809 . there are no written reasons about why schopenhauer chose that university instead of the then more famous university of jena , but göttingen was known as more modern and scientifically oriented , with less attention given to theology . law or medicine were usual choices for young men of schopenhauers status who also needed career and income ; he chose medicine due to his scientific interests . among his notable professors were bernhard friedrich thibaut , arnold hermann ludwig heeren , johann friedrich blumenbach , friedrich stromeyer , heinrich adolf schrader , johann tobias mayer and konrad johann martin langenbeck . he studied metaphysics , psychology and logic under gottlob ernst schulze , the author of aenesidemus , who made a strong impression and advised him to concentrate on plato and immanuel kant . he decided to switch from medicine to philosophy around 1810–11 and he left göttingen , which did not have a strong philosophy program : besides schulze , the only other philosophy professor was friedrich bouterwek , whom schopenhauer disliked . he did not regret his medicinal and scientific studies ; he claimed that they were necessary for a philosopher , and even in berlin he attended more lectures in sciences than in philosophy . during his days at göttingen , he spent considerable time studying , but also continued his flute playing and social life . his friends included friedrich gotthilf osann , karl witte , christian charles josias von bunsen , and william backhouse astor sr . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he arrived at the newly founded university of berlin for the winter semester of 1811–12 . at the same time , his mother had just begun her literary career ; she published her first book in 1810 , a biography of her friend karl ludwig fernow , which was a critical success . arthur attended lectures by the prominent post - kantian philosopher johann gottlieb fichte , but quickly found many points of disagreement with his wissenschaftslehre ; he also found fichtes lectures tedious and hard to understand . he later mentioned fichte only in critical , negative terms he also attended the lectures of the famous protestant theologian friedrich schleiermacher , whom he also quickly came to dislike . his notes and comments on schleiermachers lectures show that schopenhauer was becoming very critical of religion and moving towards atheism . he learned by self - directed reading ; besides plato , kant and fichte he also read the works of schelling , fries , jacobi , bacon , locke , and much current scientific literature . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer left berlin in a rush in 1813 , fearing that the city could be attacked and that he could be pressed into military service as prussia had just joined the war against france . he returned to weimar but left after less than a month , disgusted by the fact that his mother was now living with her supposed lover , georg friedrich konrad ludwig müller von gerstenbergk ( 1778–1838 ) , a civil servant twelve years younger than her ; he considered the relationship an act of infidelity to his fathers memory . he settled for a while in rudolstadt , hoping that no army would pass through the small town . he spent his time in solitude , hiking in the mountains and the thuringian forest and writing his dissertation , on the fourfold root of the principle of sufficient reason . he completed his dissertation at about the same time as the french army was defeated at the battle of leipzig . he became irritated by the arrival of soldiers in the town and accepted his mothers invitation to visit her in weimar . she tried to convince him that her relationship with gerstenbergk was platonic and that she had no intention of remarrying . but schopenhauer remained suspicious and often came in conflict with gerstenbergk because he considered him untalented , pretentious , and nationalistic . his mother had just published her second book , reminiscences of a journey in the years 1803 , 1804 , and 1805 , a description of their family tour of europe , which quickly became a hit . she found his dissertation incomprehensible and said it was unlikely that anyone would ever buy a copy . in a fit of temper arthur told her that people would read his work long after the " rubbish " she wrote was totally forgotten . in fact , although they considered her novels of dubious quality , the brockhaus publishing firm held her in high esteem because they consistently sold well . hans brockhaus ( 1888–1965 ) later claimed that his predecessors " saw nothing in this manuscript , but wanted to please one of our best - selling authors by publishing her sons work . we published more and more of her son arthurs work and today nobody remembers johanna , but her sons works are in steady demand and contribute to brockhauss reputation . " he kept large portraits of the pair in his office in leipzig for the edification of his new editors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break also contrary to his mothers prediction , schopenhauers dissertation made an impression on goethe , to whom he sent it as a gift . although it is doubtful that goethe agreed with schopenhauers philosophical positions , he was impressed by his intellect and extensive scientific education . their subsequent meetings and correspondence were a great honor to a young philosopher , who was finally acknowledged by his intellectual hero . they mostly discussed goethes newly published ( and somewhat lukewarmly received ) work on color theory . schopenhauer soon started writing his own treatise on the subject , on vision and colors , which in many points differed from his teachers . although they remained polite towards each other , their growing theoretical disagreements—and especially schopenhauers extreme self - confidence and tactless criticisms—soon made goethe become distant again and after 1816 their correspondence became less frequent . schopenhauer later admitted that he was greatly hurt by this rejection , but he continued to praise goethe , and considered his color theory a great introduction to his own . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another important experience during his stay in weimar was his acquaintance with friedrich majer—a historian of religion , orientalist and disciple of herder—who introduced him to eastern philosophy ( see also indology ) . schopenhauer was immediately impressed by the upanishads ( he called them " the production of the highest human wisdom " , and believed that they contained superhuman concepts ) and the buddha , and put them on a par with plato and kant . he continued his studies by reading the bhagavad gita , an amateurish german journal asiatisches magazin and asiatick researches by the asiatic society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer read the latin translation and praised the upanishads in his main work , the world as will and representation ( 1819 ) , as well as in his parerga and paralipomena ( 1851 ) , and commented , in the whole world there is no study so beneficial and so elevating as that of the upanishads . it has been the solace of my life , it will be the solace of my death . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as the relationship with his mother fell to a new low , in may 1814 he left weimar and moved to dresden . his friends in dresden were johann gottlob von quandt , friedrich laun , karl christian friedrich krause and ludwig sigismund ruhl , a young painter who made a romanticized portrait of him in which he improved some of schopenhauers unattractive physical features . his criticisms of local artists occasionally caused public quarrels when he ran into them in public . schopenhauers main occupation during his stay in dresden was his seminal philosophical work , the world as will and representation , which he started writing in 1814 and finished in 1818 . he was recommended to the publisher friedrich arnold brockhaus by baron ferdinand von biedenfeld , an acquaintance of his mother . although brockhaus accepted his manuscript , schopenhauer made a poor impression because of his quarrelsome and fussy attitude , as well as very poor sales of the book after it was published in december 1818 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in september 1818 , while waiting for his book to be published and conveniently escaping an affair with a maid that caused an unwanted pregnancy , schopenhauer left dresden for a year - long vacation in italy . he visited venice , bologna , florence , naples and milan , travelling alone or accompanied by mostly english tourists he met . he spent the winter months in rome , where he accidentally met his acquaintance karl witte and engaged in numerous quarrels with german tourists in the caffè greco , among them johann friedrich böhmer , who also mentioned his insulting remarks and unpleasant character . he enjoyed art , architecture , and ancient ruins , attended plays and operas , and continued his philosophical contemplation and love affairs . one of his affairs supposedly became serious , and for a while he contemplated marriage to a rich italian noblewoman—but , despite his mentioning this several times , no details are known and it may have been schopenhauer exaggerating . he corresponded regularly with his sister adele and became close to her as her relationship with johanna and gerstenbergk also deteriorated . she informed him about their financial troubles as the banking house of muhl in danzig—in which her mother invested their whole savings and arthur a third of his—was near bankruptcy . arthur offered to share his assets , but his mother refused and became further enraged by his insulting comments . the women managed to receive only thirty percent of their savings while arthur , using his business knowledge , took a suspicious and aggressive stance towards the banker and eventually received his part in full . the affair additionally worsened the relationships among all three members of the schopenhauer family . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he shortened his stay in italy because of the trouble with muhl and returned to dresden . disturbed by the financial risk and the lack of responses to his book he decided to take an academic position since it provided him with both income and an opportunity to promote his views . he contacted his friends at universities in heidelberg , göttingen and berlin and found berlin most attractive . he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of the famous philosopher hegel , whom schopenhauer described as a " clumsy charlatan " . he was especially appalled by hegels supposedly poor knowledge of natural sciences and tried to engage him in a quarrel about it already at his test lecture in march 1820 . hegel was also facing political suspicions at the time , when many progressive professors were fired , while schopenhauer carefully mentioned in his application that he had no interest in politics . despite their differences and the arrogant request to schedule lectures at the same time as his own , hegel still voted to accept schopenhauer to the university . only five students turned up to schopenhauers lectures , and he dropped out of academia . a late essay , " on university philosophy " , expressed his resentment towards the work conducted in academies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after his tenure in academia , he continued to travel extensively , visiting leipzig , nuremberg , stuttgart , schaffhausen , vevey , milan and spending eight months in florence . before he left for his three - year travel , schopenhauer had an incident with his berlin neighbor , 47 - year - old seamstress caroline louise marquet . the details of the august 1821 incident are unknown . he claimed that he had just pushed her from his entrance after she had rudely refused to leave , and that she had purposely fallen to the ground so that she could sue him . she claimed that he had attacked her so violently that she had become paralyzed on her right side and unable to work . she immediately sued him , and the process lasted until may 1827 , when a court found schopenhauer guilty and forced him to pay her an annual pension until her death in 1842 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer enjoyed italy , where he studied art and socialized with italian and english nobles . it was his last visit to the country . he left for munich and stayed there for a year , mostly recuperating from various health issues , some of them possibly caused by venereal diseases ( the treatment his doctor used suggests syphilis ) . he contacted publishers , offering to translate hume into german and kant into english , but his proposals were declined . returning to berlin , he began to study spanish so he could read some of his favorite authors in their original language . he liked pedro calderón de la barca , lope de vega , miguel de cervantes , and especially baltasar gracián . he also made failed attempts to publish his translations of their works . few attempts to revive his lectures—again scheduled at the same time as hegels—also failed , as did his inquiries about relocating to other universities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during his berlin years , schopenhauer occasionally mentioned his desire to marry and have a family . for a while he was unsuccessfully courting 17 - year - old flora weiss , who was 22 years younger than himself . his unpublished writings from that time show that he was already very critical of monogamy but still not advocating polygyny—instead musing about a polyamorous relationship that he called " tetragamy " . he had an on - and - off relationship with a young dancer , caroline richter ( she also used the surname medon after one of her ex - lovers ) . they met when he was 33 and she was 19 and working at the berlin opera . she had already had numerous lovers and a son out of wedlock , and later gave birth to another son , this time to an unnamed foreign diplomat ( she soon had another pregnancy but the child was stillborn ) . as schopenhauer was preparing to escape from berlin in 1831 , due to a cholera epidemic , he offered to take her with him on the condition that she left her young son behind . she refused and he went alone ; in his will he left her a significant sum of money , but insisted that it should not be spent in any way on her second son . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer claimed that , in his last year in berlin , he had a prophetic dream that urged him to escape from the city . as he arrived in his new home in frankfurt , he supposedly had another supernatural experience , an apparition of his dead father and his mother , who was still alive . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break upon his arrival in frankfurt , he experienced a period of depression and declining health . he renewed his correspondence with his mother , and she seemed concerned that he might commit suicide like his father . by now johanna and adele were living very modestly . johannas writing did not bring her much income , and her popularity was waning . their correspondence remained reserved , and arthur seemed undisturbed by her death in 1838 . his relationship with his sister grew closer and he corresponded with her until she died in 1849 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in july 1832 schopenhauer left frankfurt for mannheim but returned in july 1833 to remain there for the rest of his life , except for a few short journeys . he lived alone except for a succession of pet poodles named atman and butz . in 1836 , he published on the will in nature . in 1836 , he sent his essay " on the freedom of the will " to the contest of the royal norwegian society of sciences and won the prize for the following year . he sent another essay , " on the basis of morality " , to the royal danish society for scientific studies , but did not win the prize despite being the only contestant . the society was appalled that several distinguished contemporary philosophers were mentioned in a very offensive manner , and claimed that the essay missed the point of the set topic and that the arguments were inadequate . schopenhauer , who had been very confident that he would win , was enraged by this rejection . he published both essays as the two basic problems of ethics . the first edition , published in 1841 , again failed to draw attention to his philosophy . in the preface to the second edition , in 1860 , he was still pouring insults on the royal danish society . two years later , after some negotiations , he managed to convince his publisher , brockhaus , to print the second , updated edition of the world as will and representation . that book was again mostly ignored and the few reviews were mixed or negative . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer began to attract some followers , mostly outside academia , among practical professionals ( several of them were lawyers ) who pursued private philosophical studies . he jokingly referred to them as " evangelists " and " apostles " . one of the most active early followers was julius frauenstädt , who wrote numerous articles promoting schopenhauers philosophy . he was also instrumental in finding another publisher after brockhaus declined to publish parerga and paralipomena , believing that it would be another failure . though schopenhauer later stopped corresponding with him , claiming that he did not adhere closely enough to his ideas , frauenstädt continued to promote schopenhauers work . they renewed their communication in 1859 and schopenhauer named him heir for his literary estate . frauenstädt also became the editor of the first collected works of schopenhauer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1848 , schopenhauer witnessed violent upheaval in frankfurt after general hans adolf erdmann von auerswald and prince felix lichnowsky were murdered . he became worried for his own safety and property . even earlier in life he had had such worries and kept a sword and loaded pistols near his bed to defend himself from thieves . he gave a friendly welcome to austrian soldiers who wanted to shoot revolutionaries from his window and as they were leaving he gave one of the officers his opera glasses to help him monitor rebels . he even modified his will , leaving a large part of his property to a prussian fund that helped soldiers who became invalids while fighting rebellion in 1848 or the families of soldiers who died in battle . as young hegelians were advocating change and progress , schopenhauer claimed that misery is natural for humans and that , even if some utopian society were established , people would still fight each other out of boredom , or would starve due to overpopulation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1851 , schopenhauer published parerga and paralipomena , which contains essays that are supplementary to his main work . it was his first successful , widely read book , partly due to the work of his disciples who wrote praising reviews . the essays that proved most popular were the ones that actually did not contain the basic philosophical ideas of his system . many academic philosophers considered him a great stylist and cultural critic but did not take his philosophy seriously . or to claim that there were numerous contradictions in his philosophy . both criticisms enraged schopenhauer . he was becoming less interested in intellectual fights , but encouraged his disciples to do so . his private notes and correspondence show that he acknowledged some of the criticisms regarding contradictions , inconsistencies , and vagueness in his philosophy , but claimed that he was not concerned about harmony and agreement in his propositions and that some of his ideas should not be taken literally but instead as metaphors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break academic philosophers were also starting to notice his work . in 1856 , the university of leipzig sponsored an essay contest about schopenhauers philosophy , which was won by rudolf seydels very critical essay . schopenhauers friend jules lunteschütz made the first of his four portraits of him—which schopenhauer did not particularly like—which was soon sold to a wealthy landowner , carl ferdinand wiesike , who built a house to display it . schopenhauer seemed flattered and amused by this , and would claim that it was his first chapel . as his fame increased , copies of paintings and photographs of him were being sold and admirers were visiting the places where he had lived and written his works . people visited frankfurts englischer hof to observe him dining . admirers gave him gifts and asked for autographs . he complained that he still felt isolated due to his not very social nature and the fact that many of his good friends had already died from old age . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he remained healthy in his own old age , which he attributed to regular walks no matter the weather and always getting enough sleep . he had a great appetite and could read without glasses , but his hearing had been declining since his youth and he developed problems with rheumatism . he remained active and lucid , continued his reading , writing and correspondence until his death . the last friend to visit him was wilhelm gwinner ; according to him , schopenhauer was concerned that he would not be able to finish his planned additions to parerga and paralipomena but was at peace with dying . he died of pulmonary - respiratory failure on 21 september 1860 while sitting at home on his couch . he died at the age of 72 and had a funeral conducted by a lutheran minister . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer saw his philosophy as an extension of kants , and used the results of kantian epistemological investigation ( transcendental idealism ) as starting point for his own . kant had argued that the empirical world is merely a complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our mental representations . schopenhauer did not deny that the external world existed empirically but followed kant in claiming that our knowledge and experience of the world is always indirect . schopenhauer reiterates this in the first sentence of his main work : " the world is my representation ( die welt ist meine vorstellung ) " . everything that there is for cognition ( the entire world ) exists simply as an object in relation to a subject—a ' representation ' to a subject . everything that belongs to the world is , therefore , ' subject - dependent ' . in book one of the world as will and representation , schopenhauer considers the world from this angle—that is , insofar as it is representation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in november 1813 goethe invited schopenhauer to help him on his theory of colours . although schopenhauer considered colour theory a minor matter , he accepted the invitation out of admiration for goethe . nevertheless , these investigations led him to his most important discovery in epistemology : finding a demonstration for the a priori nature of causality . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break kant openly admitted that it was humes skeptical assault on causality that motivated the critical investigations in his critique of pure reason and gave an elaborate proof to show that causality is a priori . after schulze had made it plausible that kant had not disproven humes skepticism , it was up to those loyal to kants project to prove this important matter . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the difference between the approaches of kant and schopenhauer was this : kant simply declared that the empirical content of perception is " given " to us from outside , an expression with which schopenhauer often expressed his dissatisfaction . he , on the other hand , was occupied with the questions : how do we get this empirical content of perception ; how is it possible to comprehend subjective sensations " limited to my skin " as the objective perception of things that lie " outside " of me ? uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break causality is therefore not an empirical concept drawn from objective perceptions , as hume had maintained ; instead , as kant had said , objective perception presupposes knowledge of causality . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by this intellectual operation , comprehending every effect in our sensory organs as having an external cause , the external world arises . with vision , finding the cause is essentially simplified due to light acting in straight lines . we are seldom conscious of the process that interprets the double sensation in both eyes as coming from one object , that inverts the impressions on the retinas , and that uses the change in the apparent position of an object relative to more distant objects provided by binocular vision to perceive depth and distance . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer stresses the importance of the intellectual nature of perception ; the senses furnish the raw material by which the intellect produces the world as representation . he set out his theory of perception for the first time in on vision and colors , and , in the subsequent editions of fourfold root , an extensive exposition is given in § 21 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in book two of the world as will and representation , schopenhauer considers what the world is beyond the aspect of it that appears to us—that is , the aspect of the world beyond representation , the world considered " in - itself " or " noumena " , its inner essence . the very being in - itself of all things , schopenhauer argues , is will ( wille ) . the empirical world that appears to us as representation has plurality and is ordered in a spatio - temporal framework . the world as thing in - itself must exist outside the subjective forms of space and time . although the world manifests itself to our experience as a multiplicity of objects ( the " objectivation " of the will ) , each element of this multiplicity has the same blind essence striving towards existence and life . human rationality is merely a secondary phenomenon that does not distinguish humanity from the rest of nature at the fundamental , essential level . the advanced cognitive abilities of human beings , schopenhauer argues , serve the ends of willing—an illogical , directionless , ceaseless striving that condemns the human individual to a life of suffering unredeemed by any final purpose . schopenhauers philosophy of the will as the essential reality behind the world as representation is often called metaphysical voluntarism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for schopenhauer , understanding the world as will leads to ethical concerns ( see the ethics section below for further detail ) , which he explores in the fourth book of the world as will and representation and again in his two prize essays on ethics , on the freedom of the will and on the basis of morality . no individual human actions are free , schopenhauer argues , because they are events in the world of appearance and thus are subject to the principle of sufficient reason : a persons actions are a necessary consequence of motives and the given character of the individual human . necessity extends to the actions of human beings just as it does to every other appearance , and thus we cannot speak of freedom of individual willing . albert einstein quoted the schopenhauerian idea that " a man can do as he will , but not will as he will . " yet the will as thing in - itself is free , as it exists beyond the realm of representation and thus is not constrained by any of the forms of necessity that are part of the principle of sufficient reason . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to schopenhauer , salvation from our miserable existence can come through the wills being " tranquillized " by the metaphysical insight that reveals individuality to be merely an illusion . the saint or ' great soul ' intuitively " recognizes the whole , comprehends its essence , and finds that it is constantly passing away , caught up in vain strivings , inner conflict , and perpetual suffering " . the negation of the will , in other words , stems from the insight that the world in - itself ( free from the forms of space and time ) is one . ascetic practices , schopenhauer remarks , are used to aid the wills " self - abolition " , which brings about a blissful , redemptive " will - less " state of emptiness that is free from striving or suffering . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for schopenhauer , human " willing " —desiring , craving , etcetera—is at the root of suffering . a temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation . here one moves away from ordinary cognizance of individual things to cognizance of eternal platonic ideas—in other words , cognizance that is free from the service of will . in aesthetic contemplation , one no longer perceives an object of perception as something from which one is separated ; rather " it is as if the object alone existed without anyone perceiving it , and one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception , but the two have become one , the entirety of consciousness entirely filled and occupied by a single perceptual image " . subject and object are no longer distinguishable , and the idea comes to the fore . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from this aesthetic immersion , one is no longer an individual who suffers as a result of servitude to ones individual will but , rather , becomes a " pure , will - less , painless , timeless , subject of cognition " . the pure , will - less subject of cognition is cognizant only of ideas , not individual things : this is a kind of cognition that is unconcerned with relations between objects according to the principle of sufficient reason ( time , space , cause and effect ) and instead involves complete absorption in the object . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation , since it attempts to depict the essence / pure ideas of the world . music , for schopenhauer , is the purest form of art because it is the one that depicts the will itself without it appearing as subject to the principle of sufficient reason , therefore as an individual object . according to daniel albright , " schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas , but actually embodied the will itself " . he deemed music a timeless , universal language comprehended everywhere , that can imbue global enthusiasm , if in possession of a significant melody . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauers realist views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of contemporaneous attempts to prove the parallel postulate in euclidean geometry . writing shortly before the discovery of hyperbolic geometry demonstrated the logical independence of the axiom—and long before the general theory of relativity revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space—schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect concepts to prove what he held was directly evident from intuitive perception . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break throughout his writings , schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts , instead of from intuitive perceptions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove euclids parallel postulate , he did see a reason for examining another of euclids axioms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this follows kants reasoning . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer asserts that the task of ethics is not to prescribe moral actions that ought to be done , but to investigate moral actions . as such , he states that philosophy is always theoretical : its task to explain what is given . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to kants transcendental idealism , space and time are forms of our sensibility in which phenomena appear in multiplicity . reality in itself is free from multiplicity , not in the sense that an object is one , but that it is outside the possibility of multiplicity . two individuals , though they appear distinct , are in - themselves not distinct . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break appearances are entirely subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason . the egoistic individual who focuses his aims on his own interests has to deal with empirical laws as well as he can . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break what is relevant for ethics are individuals who can act against their own self - interest . if we take a man who suffers when he sees his fellow men living in poverty and consequently uses a significant part of his income to support their needs instead of his own pleasures , then the simplest way to describe this is that he makes less distinction between himself and others than is usually made . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break regarding how things appear to us , the egoist asserts a gap between two individuals , but the altruist experiences the sufferings of others as his own . in the same way a compassionate man cannot hurt animals , though they appear as distinct from himself . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break what motivates the altruist is compassion . the suffering of others is for him not a cold matter to which he is indifferent , but he feels connectiveness to all beings . compassion is thus the basis of morality . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer calls the principle through which multiplicity appears the principium individuationis . when we behold nature we see that it is a cruel battle for existence . individual manifestations of the will can maintain themselves only at the expense of others—the will , as the only thing that exists , has no other option but to devour itself to experience pleasure . this is a fundamental characteristic of the will , and cannot be circumvented . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unlike temporal or human justice , which requires time to repay an evil deed and " has its seat in the state , as requiting and punishing " , eternal justice is not retributive , because retribution requires time . there are no delays or reprieves . instead , punishment is tied to the offence , " to the point where the two become one . tormenter and tormented are one . the tormenter errs in that he believes he is not a partaker in the suffering ; the tormented , in that he believes he is not a partaker in the guilt . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break suffering is the moral outcome of our attachment to pleasure . schopenhauer deemed that this truth was expressed by the christian dogma of original sin and , in eastern religions , by the dogma of rebirth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he who sees through the principium individuationis and comprehends suffering in general as his own will see suffering everywhere and , instead of fighting for the happiness of his individual manifestation , will abhor life itself since he knows that it is inseparably connected with suffering . for him , a happy individual life in a world of suffering is like a beggar who dreams one night that he is a king . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break those who have experienced this intuitive knowledge cannot affirm life , but exhibit asceticism and quietism , meaning that they are no longer sensitive to motives , are not concerned about their individual welfare , and accept without resistance the evil that others inflict on them . they welcome poverty and neither seek nor flee death . schopenhauer referred to asceticism as the denial of the will to live . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break human life is a ceaseless struggle for satisfaction and , instead of continuing their struggle , ascetics break it . it does not matter if these ascetics adhere to the dogmata of christianity or to dharmic religions , since their way of living is the result of intuitive knowledge . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break philosophers have not traditionally been impressed by the necessity of sex , but schopenhauer addressed sex and related concepts forthrightly : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he named a force within man that he felt took invariable precedence over reason : the will to live or will to life ( wille zum leben ) , defined as an inherent drive within human beings , and all creatures , to stay alive ; a force that inveigles us into reproducing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer refused to conceive of love as either trifling or accidental , but rather understood it as an immensely powerful force that lay unseen within mans psyche , guaranteeing the quality of the human race : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it has often been argued that schopenhauers thoughts on sexuality foreshadowed the theory of evolution , a claim met with satisfaction by darwin as he included a quotation from schopenhauer in his descent of man . this has also been noted about freuds concepts of the libido and the unconscious mind , and evolutionary psychology in general . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauers politics were an echo of his system of ethics , which he elucidated in detail in his die beiden grundprobleme der ethik ( the two essays on the freedom of the will and on the basis of morality ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in occasional political comments in his parerga and paralipomena and manuscript remains , schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of limited government . schopenhauer shared the view of thomas hobbes on the necessity of the state and state action to check the innate destructive tendencies of our species . he also defended the independence of the legislative , judicial and executive branches of power , and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice ( in a practical and everyday sense , not a cosmological one ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he declared that monarchy is " natural to man in almost the same way as it is to bees and ants , to cranes in flight , to wandering elephants , to wolves in a pack in search of prey , and to other animals " . intellect in monarchies , he writes , always has " much better chances against stupidity , its implacable and ever - present foe , than it has in republics ; but this is a great advantage . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by his own admission , schopenhauer did not give much thought to politics , and several times he wrote proudly of how little attention he paid " to political affairs of his day " . in a life that spanned several revolutions in french and german government , and a few continent - shaking wars , he maintained his position of " minding not the times but the eternities " . he wrote many disparaging remarks about germany and the germans . a typical example is : " for a german it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth , for he thinks slowly , and they give him time to reflect . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the state , schopenhauer claimed , punishes criminals to prevent future crimes . it places " beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone , in the inescapable punishment . accordingly , the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter - motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined " he claimed that this doctrine was not original to him but had appeared in the writings of plato , seneca , hobbes , pufendorf , and anselm feuerbach . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern " white races " due to their sensitivity and creativity ( except for the ancient egyptians and hindus , whom he saw as equal ) : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the highest civilization and culture , apart from the ancient hindus and egyptians , are found exclusively among the white races ; and even with many dark peoples , the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has , therefore , evidently immigrated , for example , the brahmans , the incas , and the rulers of the south sea islands . all this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north , and there gradually became white , had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need , want and misery , which in their many forms were brought about by the climate . this they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer was fervently opposed to slavery . speaking of the treatment of slaves in the slave - holding states of the united states , he condemned " those devils in human form , those bigoted , church - going , strict sabbath - observing scoundrels , especially the anglican parsons among them " for how they " treat their innocent black brothers who through violence and injustice have fallen into their devils claws " . the slave - holding states of north america , schopenhauer writes , are a " disgrace to the whole of humanity " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his metaphysics of sexual love , schopenhauer wrote : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break further , the consideration as to the complexion is very decided . blondes prefer dark persons , or brunettes ; but the latter seldom prefer the former . the reason is , that fair hair and blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type , almost an abnormity , analogous to white mice , or at least to grey horses . in no part of the world , not even in the vicinity of the pole , are they indigenous , except in europe , and are clearly of scandinavian origin . i may here express my opinion in passing that the white colour of the skin is not natural to man , but that by nature he has a black or brown skin , like our forefathers the hindus ; that consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the womb of nature , and that thus there is no such thing as a white race , much as this is talked of , but every white man is a faded or bleached one . forced into the strange world , where he only exists like an exotic plant , and like this requires in winter the hothouse , in the course of thousands of years man became white . the gipsies , an indian race which immigrated only about four centuries ago , show the transition from the complexion of the hindu to our own . therefore in sexual love nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type ; but the white colour of the skin has become a second nature , though not so that the brown of the hindu repels us . finally , each one also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of his own defects and aberrations , and does so the more decidedly the more important the part is . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer also maintained a marked metaphysical and political anti - judaism . he argued that christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of judaism , exhibiting an indian - influenced ethics reflecting the aryan - vedic theme of spiritual self - conquest . he saw this as opposed to the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly " jewish " spirit : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break judaism is , therefore , the crudest and poorest of all religions and consists merely in an absurd and revolting theism . it amounts to this that the κύριος ' lord ' , who has created the world , desires to be worshipped and adored ; and so above all he is jealous , is envious of his colleagues , of all the other gods ; if sacrifices are made to them he is furious and his jews have a bad time it is most deplorable that this religion has become the basis of the prevailing religion of europe ; for it is a religion without any metaphysical tendency . while all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life , the religion of the jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war - cry in the struggle with other nations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his 1851 essay " on women " , schopenhauer expressed opposition to what he called " teutonico - christian stupidity " of " reflexive , unexamined reverence for the female ( abgeschmackten weiberveneration ) " . he wrote : " women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish , frivolous and short - sighted . " he opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice , and expressed his opposition to monogamy . he claimed that " woman is by nature meant to obey " . the essay does give some compliments : " women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than men are " , and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauers writings influenced many , from friedrich nietzsche to nineteenth - century feminists . eminism and the limits of equality uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pa cain – ga . rev . 1989 his biological analysis of the difference between the sexes , and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction , anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when the elderly schopenhauer sat for a sculpture portrait by the prussian sculptor elisabet ney in 1859 , he was much impressed by the young womans wit and independence , as well as by her skill as a visual artist . after his time with ney , he told richard wagners friend malwida von meysenbug : " i have not yet spoken my last word about women . i believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass , or rather raising herself above the mass , she grows ceaselessly and more than a man . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the third , expanded edition of the world as will and representation ( 1859 ) , schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the metaphysics of sexual love . he wrote that pederasty has the benefit of preventing ill - begotten children . concerning this , he stated that " the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature , and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims , although only indirectly , as a means for preventing greater evils " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer ends the appendix with the statement that " by expounding these paradoxical ideas , i wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour . i have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that i defend and commend pederasty . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer viewed personality and intellect as inherited . he quotes horaces saying , " from the brave and good are the brave descended " ( odes , iv , 4 , 29 ) and shakespeares line from cymbeline , " cowards father cowards , and base things sire base " ( iv , 2 ) to reinforce his hereditarian argument . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break mechanistically , schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his intellect through his mother , and personal character through the father . this belief in heritability of traits informed schopenhauers view of love—placing it at the highest level of importance . for schopenhauer the " final aim of all love intrigues , be they comic or tragic , is really of more importance than all other ends in human life . what it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation . it is not the weal or woe of any one individual , but that of the human race to come , which is here at stake . " this view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on eugenics or good breeding . here schopenhauer wrote : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties , we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within , not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation . plato had something of the kind in mind when , in the fifth book of his republic , he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste . if we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent , and give men of noble character a whole harem , and procure men , and indeed thorough men , for all girls of intellect and understanding , then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of pericles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in another context , schopenhauer reiterated his eugenic thesis : " if you want utopian plans , i would say : the only solution to the problem is the despotism of the wise and noble members of a genuine aristocracy , a genuine nobility , achieved by mating the most magnanimous men with the cleverest and most gifted women . this proposal constitutes my utopia and my platonic republic . " analysts ( for example , keith ansell - pearson ) have suggested that schopenhauers anti - egalitarianist sentiment and his support for eugenics influenced the neo - aristocratic philosophy of friedrich nietzsche , who initially considered schopenhauer his mentor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a consequence of his monistic philosophy , schopenhauer was very concerned about animal welfare . for him , all individual animals , including humans , are essentially phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying will . for him the word " will " designates force , power , impulse , energy , and desire ; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the essence of all external things and our own direct , inner experience . since every living thing possesses will , humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other . for this reason , he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals , who are our fellow sufferers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1841 , he praised the establishment in london of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals , and in philadelphia of the animals ' friends society . schopenhauer went so far as to protest using the pronoun " it " in reference to animals because that led to treatment of them as though they were inanimate things . to reinforce his points , schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer was very attached to his succession of pet poodles . he criticized spinozas belief that animals are a mere means for the satisfaction of humans . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer read the latin translation of the ancient hindu texts , the upanishads , translated by french writer anquetil du perron from the persian translation of prince dara shukoh entitled sirre - akbar ( " the great secret " ) . he was so impressed by its philosophy that he called it " the production of the highest human wisdom " , and believed it contained superhuman concepts . schopenhauer considered india as " the land of the most ancient and most pristine wisdom , the place from which europeans could trace their descent and the tradition by which they had been influenced in so many decisive ways " , and regarded the upanishads as " the most profitable and elevating reading which is possible in the world . it has been the solace of my life , and will be the solace of my death . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer was first introduced to anquetil du perrons translation by friedrich majer in 1814 . they met during the winter of 1813–1814 in weimar at the home of schopenhauers mother , according to the biographer safranski . majer was a follower of herder , and an early indologist . schopenhauer did not begin serious study of the indic texts until the summer of 1814 . safranski maintains that , between 1815 and 1817 , schopenhauer had another important cross - pollination with indian thought in dresden . this was through his neighbor of two years , karl christian friedrich krause . krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with ancient indian wisdom . krause had also mastered sanskrit , unlike schopenhauer , and they developed a professional relationship . it was from krause that schopenhauer learned meditation and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning indian thought . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the book oupnekhat ( upanishad ) always lay open on his table , and he invariably studied it before going to bed . he called the opening up of sanskrit literature " the greatest gift of our century " , and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the upanishads would become the cherished faith of the west . most noticeable , in the case of schopenhauers work , was the significance of the chandogya upanishad , whose mahāvākya , tat tvam asi , is mentioned throughout the world as will and representation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the four noble truths of buddhism . belson , peter ( april 1993 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ' schopenhauer ' , ' and ' , ' buddhism ' . philosophy east and west volume 43 , number 2 , pp . university of hawaii press . retrieved on : 12 april 2008 . similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering , that suffering is caused by desire ( taṇhā ) , and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation . thus three of the four " truths of the buddha " correspond to schopenhauers doctrine of the will . in buddhism , while greed and lust are always unskillful , desire is ethically variable – it can be skillful , unskillful , or neutral . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for schopenhauer , will had ontological primacy over the intellect ; desire is prior to thought . schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of puruṣārtha or goals of life in vedānta hinduism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in schopenhauers philosophy , denial of the will is attained by : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break buddhist nirvāṇa is not equivalent to the condition that schopenhauer described as denial of the will . nirvāṇa is not the extinguishing of the person as some western scholars have thought , but only the " extinguishing " ( the literal meaning of nirvana ) of the flames of greed , hatred , and delusion that assail a persons character . schopenhauer made the following statement in his discussion of religions : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " schopenhauer is often said to be the first modern western philosopher to attempt integration of his work with eastern ways of thinking . that he was the first is true , but the claim that he was influenced by indian thought needs qualification . there is a remarkable correspondence in broad terms between some central schopenhauerian doctrines and buddhism : notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering , that suffering originates in desires , and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires . these three ' truths of the buddha ' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will . " ( on this , see dorothea dauer , schopenhauer as transmitter of buddhist ideas . note also the discussion by bryan magee , the philosophy of schopenhauer , pp . 14–15 , 316–321 ) . janaway , christopher , self and world in schopenhauers philosophy , p . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if i wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth , i should have to concede to buddhism pre - eminence over the others . in any case , it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own , for this numbers far more followers than any other . and this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me , inasmuch as in my philosophizing i have certainly not been under its influence ' added ' . for up till 1818 , when my work appeared , there was to be found in europe only a very few accounts of buddhism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break buddhist philosopher keiji nishitani sought to distance buddhism from schopenhauer . while schopenhauers philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary , his methodology was resolutely empirical , rather than speculative or transcendental : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break philosophy is a science , and as such has no articles of faith ; accordingly , in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically , or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break also note : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this actual world of what is knowable , in which we are and which is in us , remains both the material and the limit of our consideration . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the argument that buddhism affected schopenhauers philosophy more than any other dharmic faith loses credence since he did not begin a serious study of buddhism until after the publication of the world as will and representation in 1818 . scholars have started to revise earlier views about schopenhauers discovery of buddhism . proof of early interest and influence appears in schopenhauers 1815–16 notes ( transcribed and translated by urs app ) about buddhism . they are included in a recent case study that traces schopenhauers interest in buddhism and documents its influence . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break app , urs ' arthur ' , ' schopenhauer ' , ' and ' , ' china . , " sino - platonic " , " papers " , ' nr . , ' 200 ' , ' ( april ' , ' 2010 ) ' ( pdf , 8mb pdf , 164 p . schopenhauers early notes on buddhism reproduced in appendix ) . this study provides an overview of the actual discovery of buddhism by schopenhauer . other scholarly work questions how similar schopenhauers philosophy actually is to buddhism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some traditions in western esotericism and parapsychology interested schopenhauer and influenced his philosophical theories . he praised animal magnetism as evidence for the reality of magic in his on the will in nature , and went so far as to accept the division of magic into left - hand and right - hand magic , although he doubted the existence of demons . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer grounded magic in the will and claimed all forms of magical transformation depended on the human will , not on ritual . this theory notably parallels aleister crowleys system of magick and its emphasis on human will . schopenhauer rejected the theory of disenchantment and claimed philosophy should synthesize itself with magic , which he believed amount to " practical metaphysics . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break neoplatonism , including the traditions of plotinus and to a lesser extent marsilio ficino , has also been cited as an influence on schopenhauer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer had a wide range of interests , from science and opera to occultism and literature . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his student years , schopenhauer went more often to lectures in the sciences than philosophy . he kept a strong interest as his personal library contained near to 200 books of scientific literature at his death , and his works refer to scientific titles not found in the library . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many evenings were spent in the theatre , opera and ballet ; schopenhauer especially liked the operas of mozart , rossini and bellini . schopenhauer considered music the highest art , and played the flute during his whole life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a polyglot , he knew german , italian , spanish , french , english , latin and ancient greek , and was an avid reader of poetry and literature . he particularly revered goethe , petrarch , calderón and shakespeare . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if goethe had not been sent into the world simultaneously with kant in order to counterbalance him , so to speak , in the spirit of the age , the latter would have been haunted like a nightmare many an aspiring mind and would have oppressed it with great affliction . but now the two have an infinitely wholesome effect from opposite directions and will probably raise the german spirit to a height surpassing even that of antiquity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in philosophy , his most important influences were , according to himself , kant , plato and the upanishads . concerning the upanishads and vedas , he writes in the world as will and representation : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if the reader has also received the benefit of the vedas , the access to which by means of the upanishads is in my eyes the greatest privilege which this still young century ( 1818 ) may claim before all previous centuries , if then the reader , i say , has received his initiation in primeval indian wisdom , and received it with an open heart , he will be prepared in the very best way for hearing what i have to tell him . it will not sound to him strange , as to many others , much less disagreeable ; for i might , if it did not sound conceited , contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the upanishads , may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which i have to enunciate , though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer saw bruno and spinoza as philosophers not bound to their age or nation . " both were fulfilled by the thought , that as manifold the appearances of the world may be , it is still one being , that appears in all of them . consequently , there is no place for god as creator of the world in their philosophy , but god is the world itself . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer expressed regret that spinoza stuck for the presentation of his philosophy with the concepts of scholasticism and cartesian philosophy , and tried to use geometrical proofs that do not hold because of vague and overly broad definitions . bruno on the other hand , who knew much about nature and ancient literature , presented his ideas with italian vividness , and is amongst philosophers the only one who comes near platos poetic and dramatic power of exposition . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer noted that their philosophies do not provide any ethics , and it is therefore very remarkable that spinoza called his main work ethics . in fact , it could be considered complete from the standpoint of life - affirmation , if one completely ignores morality and self - denial . it is yet even more remarkable that schopenhauer mentions spinoza as an example of the denial of the will , if one uses the french biography by jean maximilien lucas as the key to tractatus de intellectus emendatione . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the importance of kant for schopenhauer , in philosophy as well as on a personal level , cannot be overstated . kants philosophy was the foundation of schopenhauers , and he had high praise for the transcendental aesthetic section of kants critique of pure reason . schopenhauer maintained that kant stands in the same relation to philosophers such as berkeley and plato , as copernicus to hicetas , philolaus , and aristarchus : kant succeeded in demonstrating what previous philosophers merely asserted . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer writes about kants influence on his work in the preface to the second edition of the world as will and representation : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his study room , one bust was of buddha , the other was of kant . the bond which schopenhauer felt with the philosopher of königsberg is demonstrated in an unfinished poem he dedicated to kant ( included in volume 2 of the parerga ) : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer dedicated one fifth of his main work , the world as will and representation , to a detailed criticism of the kantian philosophy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer praised kant for his distinction between appearance and the thing - in - itself , whereas the general consensus in german idealism was that this was the weakest spot of kants theory , since , according to kant , causality can find application on objects of experience only , and consequently , things - in - themselves cannot be the cause of appearances . the inadmissibility of this reasoning was also acknowledged by schopenhauer . he insisted that this was a true conclusion , drawn from false premises . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the leading figures of post - kantian philosophy—johann gottlieb fichte , schelling and hegel—were not respected by schopenhauer . he argued that they were not philosophers at all , for they lacked " the first requirement of a philosopher , namely a seriousness and honesty of inquiry . " rather , they were merely sophists who , excelling in the art of beguiling the public , pursued their own selfish interests ( such as professional advancement within the university system ) . diatribes against the vacuity , dishonesty , pomposity , and self - interest of these contemporaries are to be found throughout schopenhauers published writings . the following passage is an example : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer deemed schelling the most talented of the three and wrote that he would recommend his " elucidatory paraphrase of the highly important doctrine of kant " concerning the intelligible character , if he had been honest enough to admit he was parroting kant , instead of hiding this relation in a cunning manner . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer reserved his most unqualified damning condemnation for hegel , whom he considered less worthy than fichte or schelling . whereas fichte was merely a windbag ( windbeutel ) , hegel was a " commonplace , inane , loathsome , repulsive , and ignorant charlatan . " the philosophers karl popper and mario bunge agreed with this distinction . hegel , schopenhauer wrote in the preface to his two fundamental problems of ethics , not only " performed no service to philosophy , but he has had a detrimental influence on philosophy , and thereby on german literature in general , really a downright stupefying , or we could even say a pestilential influence , which it is therefore the duty of everyone capable of thinking for himself and judging for himself to counteract in the most express terms at every opportunity . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer remained the most influential german philosopher until the first world war . his philosophy was a starting point for a new generation of philosophers including julius bahnsen , paul deussen , lazar von hellenbach , karl robert eduard von hartmann , ernst otto lindner , philipp mainländer , friedrich nietzsche , olga plümacher and agnes taubert . his legacy shaped the intellectual debate , and forced movements that were utterly opposed to him , neo - kantianism and positivism , to address issues they would otherwise have completely ignored , and in doing so he changed them markedly . other philosophers of the 19th century who cited his influence include hans vaihinger , volkelt , solovyov and weininger . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauer was well read by physicists , most notably einstein , schrödinger , wolfgang pauli , and majorana . in his berlin study three figures hung on the wall : faraday , maxwell , schopenhauer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when erwin schrödinger discovered schopenhauer ( " the greatest savant of the west " ) he considered switching his study of physics to philosophy . he maintained the idealistic views during the rest of his life . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break but most of all schopenhauer is famous for his influence on artists . richard wagner became one of the earliest and most famous adherents of the schopenhauerian philosophy . the admiration was not mutual , and schopenhauer proclaimed : " i remain faithful to rossini and mozart ! " so he has been nicknamed " the artists philosopher " . see also influence of schopenhauer on tristan und isolde . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break under the influence of schopenhauer , leo tolstoy became convinced that the truth of all religions lies in self - renunciation . when he read schopenhauers philosophy , tolstoy exclaimed " at present i am convinced that schopenhauer is the greatest genius among men . it is the whole world in an incomparably beautiful and clear reflection . " he said that what he has written in war and peace is also said by schopenhauer in the world as will and representation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break jorge luis borges remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view , despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular , was because schopenhauer had already written it for him . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break other figures in literature who were strongly influenced by schopenhauer were thomas mann , thomas hardy , afanasy fet , - k . huysmans and george santayana . in herman melvilles final years , while he wrote billy budd , he read schopenhauers essays and marked them heavily . scholar brian yothers notes that melville " marked numerous misanthropic and even suicidal remarks , suggesting an attraction to the most extreme sorts of solitude , but he also made note of schopenhauers reflection on the moral ambiguities of genius . " schopenhauers attraction to and discussions of both eastern and western religions in conjunction with each other made an impression on melville in his final years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sergei prokofiev , although initially reluctant to engage with works noted for their pessimism , became fascinated with schopenhauer after reading aphorisms on the wisdom of life in parerga and paralipomena . " with his truths schopenhauer gave me a spiritual world and an awareness of happiness . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break friedrich nietzsche owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading the world as will and representation and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected , dedicating to him his essay " schopenhauer als erzieher " one of his untimely meditations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break early in his career , ludwig wittgenstein adopted schopenhauers epistemological idealism , and some traits of schopenhauers influence ( particularly schopenhauerian transcendentalism ) can be observed in the tractatus logico - philosophicus . later on , wittgenstein rejected epistemological transcendental idealism for gottlob freges conceptual realism . in later years , wittgenstein became highly dismissive of schopenhauer , describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker . his friend bertrand russell had a low opinion on the philosopher , and even came to attack him in his history of western philosophy for hypocritically praising asceticism yet not acting upon it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break opposite to russell on the foundations of mathematics , the dutch mathematician brouwer incorporated kants and schopenhauers ideas in the philosophical school of intuitionism , where mathematics is considered as a purely mental activity instead of an analytic activity wherein objective properties of reality are revealed . brouwer was also influenced by schopenhauers metaphysics , and wrote an essay on mysticism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauers philosophy has made its way into a novel , the schopenhauer cure , by american existential psychiatrist and emeritus professor of psychiatry irvin yalom . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break schopenhauers philosophy , and the discussions on philosophical pessimism it has engendered , has been the focus of contemporary thinkers such as david benatar , thomas ligotti , and eugene thacker . their work also served as an inspiration for the popular hbo tv series true detective . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 80: Angola ***********

angola ( ; ) , officially the republic of angola , is a country on the west coast of southern africa . it is the second - largest lusophone ( portuguese - speaking ) country in both total area and population ( behind brazil in both cases ) , and is the seventh - largest country in africa . it is bordered by namibia to the south , the dr congo to the north , zambia to the east , and the atlantic ocean to the west . angola has an exclave province , the province of cabinda , that borders the republic of the congo and the democratic republic of the congo . the capital and most populated city is luanda . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola has been inhabited since the paleolithic age . its formation as a nation - state originates from portuguese colonisation , which initially began with coastal settlements and trading posts founded in the 16th century . in the 19th century , european settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior . the portuguese colony that became angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century , owing to resistance by native groups such as the cuamato , the kwanyama and the mbunda . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after a protracted anti - colonial struggle , angola achieved independence in 1975 as a marxist–leninist one - party republic . the country descended into a devastating civil war the same year , between the ruling peoples movement for the liberation of angola ( mpla ) , backed by the soviet union and cuba , the insurgent anti - communist national union for the total independence of angola ( unita ) , supported by the united states and south africa , and the militant organisation national liberation front of angola ( fnla ) , backed by the democratic republic of the congo . the country has been governed by mpla ever since its independence in 1975 . following the end of the war in 2002 , angola emerged as a relatively stable unitary , presidential constitutional republic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola has vast mineral and petroleum reserves , and its economy is among the fastest - growing in the world , especially since the end of the civil war ; however , economic growth is highly uneven , with most of the nations wealth concentrated in a disproportionately small sector of the population and highly concentrated in china and in the united states . the standard of living remains low for most angolans ; life expectancy is among the lowest in the world , while infant mortality is among the highest . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since 2017 , the government of joão lourenço has made fighting corruption its flagship , so much so that many individuals of the previous government are either jailed or awaiting trial . whilst this effort has been recognised by foreign diplomats to be legitimate , some skeptics see the actions as being politically motivated . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola is a member of the united nations , opec , african union , the community of portuguese language countries , and the southern african development community . as of 2021 , the angolan population is estimated at 32 million . angola is multicultural and multiethnic . angolan culture reflects centuries of portuguese influence , namely the predominance of the portuguese language and of the catholic church , intermingled with a variety of indigenous customs and traditions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the name angola comes from the portuguese colonial name reino de angola ( ' kingdom of angola ' ) , which appeared as early as paulo dias de novaiss 1571 charter . the toponym was derived by the portuguese from the title ngola held by the kings of ndongo and matamba . ndongo in the highlands , between the kwanza and lucala rivers , was nominally a possession of the kingdom of kongo , but was seeking greater independence in the 16th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break modern angola was populated predominantly by nomadic khoi and san prior to the first bantu migrations . the khoi and san peoples were neither pastoralists nor cultivators , but rather hunter - gatherers . they were displaced by bantu peoples arriving from the north in the first millennium bc , most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern nigeria and southern niger . bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of bananas and taro , as well as large cattle herds , to angolas central highlands and the luanda plain . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a number of political entities were established ; the best - known of these was the kingdom of the kongo , based in angola , which extended northward to what is now the democratic republic of the congo , the republic of the congo and gabon . it established trade routes with other city - states and civilisations up to and down the coast of southwestern and western africa and even with great zimbabwe and the mutapa empire , although it engaged in little or no transoceanic trade . to its south lay the kingdom of ndongo , from which the area of the later portuguese colony was sometimes known as dongo , and right next to them lay the kingdom of matamba . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break portuguese explorer diogo cão reached the area in 1484 . the previous year , the portuguese had established relations with the kongo , which stretched at the time from modern gabon in the north to the kwanza river in the south . the portuguese established their primary early trading post at soyo , which is now the northernmost city in angola apart from the cabinda exclave . paulo dias de novais founded são paulo de loanda ( luanda ) in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers . benguela was fortified in 1587 and became a township in 1617 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the portuguese established several other settlements , forts and trading posts along the angolan coast , principally trading in angolan slaves for plantations . local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the portuguese empire , usually in exchange for manufactured goods from europe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this part of the atlantic slave trade continued until after brazils independence in the 1820s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break despite portugals territorial claims in angola , its control over much of the countrys vast interior was minimal . in the 16th century portugal gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars . life for european colonists was difficult and progress was slow . john iliffe notes that " portuguese records of angola from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years ; accompanied by epidemic disease , it might kill one - third or one - half of the population , destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the portuguese restoration war , the dutch west india company occupied the principal settlement of luanda in 1641 , using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against portuguese holdings elsewhere . a fleet under salvador de sá retook luanda in 1648 ; reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650 . new treaties with the kongo were signed in 1649 ; others with njingas kingdom of matamba and ndongo followed in 1656 . the conquest of pungo andongo in 1671 was the last major portuguese expansion from luanda , as attempts to invade kongo in 1670 and matamba in 1681 failed . colonial outposts also expanded inward from benguela , but until the late 19th century the inroads from luanda and benguela were very limited . hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s , portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of angolan territory . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the slave trade was abolished in angola in 1836 , and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves . four years later , a more progressive administration appointed by portugal abolished slavery altogether . however , these decrees remained largely unenforceable , and the portuguese depended on assistance from the british royal navy to enforce their ban on the slave trade . this coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions into the bush . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by the mid - nineteenth century portugal had established its dominion as far north as the congo river and as far south as mossâmedes . in this period , the portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in angola . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the berlin conference in 1884–1885 set the colonys borders , delineating the boundaries of portuguese claims in angola , trade between portugal and its african territories rapidly increased as a result of protective tariffs , leading to increased development , and a wave of new portuguese immigrants . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break under colonial law , black angolans were forbidden from forming political parties or labour unions . the first nationalist movements did not take root until after world war ii , spearheaded by a largely westernised and portuguese - speaking urban class , which included many mestiços . during the early 1960s they were joined by other associations stemming from ad hoc labour activism in the rural workforce . portugals refusal to address increasing angolan demands for self - determination provoked an armed conflict , which erupted in 1961 with the baixa de cassanje revolt and gradually evolved into a protracted war of independence that persisted for the next twelve years . ite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the national front for the liberation of angola ( fnla ) recruited from bakongo refugees in zaire . benefiting from particularly favourable political circumstances in léopoldville , and especially from a common border with zaire , angolan political exiles were able to build up a power base among a large expatriate community from related families , clans , and traditions . people on both sides of the border spoke mutually intelligible dialects and enjoyed shared ties to the historical kingdom of kongo . though as foreigners skilled angolans could not take advantage of mobutu sese sekos state employment programme , some found work as middlemen for the absentee owners of various lucrative private ventures . the migrants eventually formed the fnla with the intention of making a bid for political power upon their envisaged return to angola . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a largely ovimbundu guerrilla initiative against the portuguese in central angola from 1966 was spearheaded by jonas savimbi and the national union for the total independence of angola ( unita ) . it remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders , the ethnic fragmentation of the ovimbundu , and the isolation of peasants on european plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the late 1950s , the rise of the marxist–leninist popular movement for the liberation of angola ( mpla ) in the east and dembos hills north of luanda came to hold special significance . formed as a coalition resistance movement by the angolan communist party , the organisations leadership remained predominantly ambundu and courted public sector workers in luanda . although both the mpla and its rivals accepted material assistance from the soviet union or the peoples republic of china , the former harboured strong anti - imperialist views and was openly critical of the united states and its support for portugal . this allowed it to win important ground on the diplomatic front , soliciting support from nonaligned governments in morocco , ghana , guinea , mali , and the united arab republic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the mpla attempted to move its headquarters from conakry to léopoldville in october 1961 , renewing efforts to create a common front with the fnla , then known as the union of angolan peoples ( upa ) and its leader holden roberto . roberto turned down the offer . when the mpla first attempted to insert its own insurgents into angola , the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by upa partisans on robertos orders—setting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the angolan civil war . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break throughout the war of independence , the three rival nationalist movements were severely hampered by political and military factionalism , as well as their inability to unite guerrilla efforts against the portuguese . between 1961 and 1975 the mpla , unita , and the fnla competed for influence in the angolan population and the international community . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the collapse of portugals estado novo government following the 1974 carnation revolution suspended all portuguese military activity in africa and the brokering of a ceasefire pending negotiations for angolan independence . encouraged by the organisation of african unity , holden roberto , jonas savimbi , and mpla chairman agostinho neto met in mombasa in early january 1975 and agreed to form a coalition government . ite booktitleangola : a modern military historylastweigertfirststephenyear2011locationbasingstokepublisherpalgrave - macmillan uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in august 1975 , the mpla requested direct assistance from the soviet union in the form of ground troops . the soviets declined , offering to send advisers but no troops ; however , cuba was more forthcoming and in late september dispatched nearly five hundred combat personnel to angola , along with sophisticated weaponry and supplies . by independence , there were over a thousand cuban soldiers in the country . they were kept supplied by a massive airbridge carried out with soviet aircraft . the persistent buildup of cuban and soviet military aid allowed the mpla to drive its opponents from luanda and blunt an abortive intervention by zairean and south african troops , which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the fnla and unita . the fnla was largely annihilated , although unita managed to withdraw its civil officials and militia from luanda and seek sanctuary in the southern provinces . from there , savimbi continued to mount a determined insurgent campaign against the mpla . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break between 1975 and 1991 , the mpla implemented an economic and political system based on the principles of scientific socialism , incorporating central planning and a marxist–leninist one - party state . it embarked on an ambitious programme of nationalisation , and the domestic private sector was essentially abolished . the ruling party survived an attempted coup d ' état by the maoist - oriented communist organisation of angola ( oca ) in 1977 , which was suppressed after a series of bloody political purges left thousands of oca supporters dead ( see 1977 angolan coup d ' état attempt ) . in the same period , the civil war culminated in its climax in a tandem of engagements , particularly the battle of quifangondo and soon after the battle of cuito cuanavale stalemate , which marked a turning point as both sides . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the mpla abandoned its former marxist ideology at its third party congress in 1990 , and declared social democracy to be its new platform . by may 1991 it reached a peace agreement with unita , the bicesse accords , which scheduled new general elections for september 1992 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on 22 march 2002 , jonas savimbi was killed in action against government troops . unita and the mpla reached a cease - fire shortly afterwards . unita gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of a major opposition party . although the political situation of the country began to stabilise , regular democratic processes did not prevail until the elections in angola in 2008 and 2012 and the adoption of a new constitution in 2010 , all of which strengthened the prevailing dominant - party system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola has a serious humanitarian crisis ; the result of the prolonged war , of the abundance of minefields , and the continued political agitation in favour of the independence of the exclave of cabinda ( carried out in the context of the protracted cabinda conflict by the flec ) . while most of the internally displaced have now squatted around the capital , in musseques ( shanty towns ) the general situation for angolans remains desperate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a drought in 2016 caused the worst food crisis in southern africa in 25 years , affecting 1 million people across seven of angolas 18 provinces . food prices rose and acute malnutrition rates doubled , with more than 95000 children affected . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break josé eduardo dos santos stepped down as president of angola after 38 years in 2017 , being peacefully succeeded by joão lourenço , santos ' chosen successor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at 1246700 km2 , angola is the worlds twenty - fourth largest country - comparable in size to mali , or twice the size of france or of texas . it lies mostly between latitudes 4° and 18°s , and longitudes 12° and 24°e . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola borders namibia to the south , zambia to the east , the democratic republic of the congo to the north - east and the south atlantic ocean to the west . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the coastal exclave of cabinda in the north has borders with the republic of the congo to the north and with the democratic republic of the congo to the south . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angolas capital , luanda , lies on the atlantic coast in the northwest of the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola had a 2018 forest landscape integrity index mean score of 8 / 10 , ranking it 23rd globally out of 172 countries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola , although located in a tropical zone , has a climate uncharacteristic of this zone , due to the confluence of three factors : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angolas climate features two seasons : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while the coastline has high rainfall rates , decreasing from north to south and from 800 mm to 50 mm , with average annual temperatures above 23 °c , one can divide the interior zone into three areas : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break , angola is divided into eighteen provinces ( províncias ) and 162 municipalities . the municipalities are further divided into 559 communes ( townships ) . the provinces are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with an area of approximately 7283 km2 , the northern angolan province of cabinda is unusual in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip , some 60 km wide , of the democratic republic of congo along the lower congo river . cabinda borders the congo republic to the north and north - northeast and the drc to the east and south . the town of cabinda is the chief population centre . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to a 1995 census , cabinda had an estimated population of 600000 , approximately 400000 of whom are citizens of neighboring countries . population estimates are , however , highly unreliable . consisting largely of tropical forest , cabinda produces hardwoods , coffee , cocoa , crude rubber and palm oil . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the product for which it is best known , however , is its oil , which has given it the nickname , " the kuwait of africa " . cabindas petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of angolas output . most of the oil along its coast was discovered under portuguese rule by the cabinda gulf oil company ( cabgoc ) from 1968 onwards . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ever since portugal handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of angola to the local independence groups ( mpla , unita and fnla ) , the territory of cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the government of angola ( which has employed its armed forces , the faa—forças armadas angolanas ) and cabindan separatists . the front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda - armed forces of cabinda ( flec - fac ) announced the virtual federal republic of cabinda under the presidency of nzita henriques tiago . one of the characteristics of the cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation , into smaller and smaller factions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the angolan government is composed of three branches of government : executive , legislative and judicial . the executive branch of the government is composed of the president , the vice - presidents and the council of ministers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the legislative branch comprises a 220 - seat unicameral legislature , the national assembly of angola , elected from both provincial and nationwide constituencies . for decades , political power has been concentrated in the presidency . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after 38 years of rule , in 2017 president dos santos stepped down from mpla leadership . the leader of the winning party at the parliamentary elections in august 2017 would become the next president of angola . the mpla selected the former defense minister joão lourenço as santos ' chosen successor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in what has been described as a political purge to cement his power and reduce the influence of the dos santos family , lourenço subsequently sacked the chief of the national police , ambrósio de lemos , and the head of the intelligence service , apolinário josé pereira . both are considered allies of former president dos santos . he also removed isabel dos santos , daughter of the former president , as head of the countrys state oil company sonangol . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the constitution of 2010 establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens . the legal system is based on portuguese law and customary law but is weak and fragmented , and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities . a supreme court serves as the appellate tribunal ; a constitutional court does not hold the powers of judicial review . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the new constitution , adopted in 2010 , did away with presidential elections , introducing a system in which the president and the vice - president of the political party that wins the parliamentary elections automatically become president and vice - president . directly or indirectly , the president controls all other organs of the state , so there is de facto no separation of powers . in the classifications used in constitutional law , this government falls under the category of authoritarian regime . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the angolan armed forces ( faa , forças armadas angolanas ) are headed by a chief of staff who reports to the minister of defence . there are three divisions—the army ( exército ) , navy ( marinha de guerra , mga ) and national air force ( força aérea nacional , fan ) . total manpower is 107000 ; plus paramilitary forces of 10000 ( 2015 est . . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break its equipment includes russian -

largest source of imports . bilateral trade reached 27billion in 2011 , up 11 year - on - year . chinas imports , mainly crude oil and diamonds , increased 9 to 24billion while chinas exports to angola , including mechanical and electrical products , machinery parts and construction materials , surged 38 . the oil glut led to a local price for unleaded gasoline of £0 a gallon . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the angolan economy grew 18 in 2005 , 26 in 2006 and 17 in 2007 . due to the global recession , the economy contracted an estimated −0 in 2009 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angolas financial system is maintained by the national bank of angola and managed by the governor jose de lima massano . according to a study on the banking sector , carried out by deloitte , the monetary policy led by banco nacional de angola ( bna ) , the angolan national bank , allowed a decrease in the inflation rate put at 7 in december 2013 , which contributed to the sectors growth trend . estimates released by angolas central bank , said countrys economy should grow at an annual average rate of 5 per cent over the next four years , boosted by the increasing participation of the private sector . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although the countrys economy has grown significantly since angola achieved political stability in 2002 , mainly due to fast - rising earnings in the oil sector , angola faces huge social and economic problems these are in part a result of almost continual armed conflict from 1961 on , although the highest level of destruction and socio - economic damage took place after the 1975 independence , during the long years of civil war . however , high poverty rates and blatant social inequality chiefly stems from persistent authoritarianism , " neo - patrimonial " practices at all levels of the political , administrative , military and economic structures , and of a pervasive corruption . the main beneficiaries are political , administrative , economic and military power holders , who have accumulated ( and continue to accumulate ) enormous wealth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " secondary beneficiaries " are the middle strata that are about to become social classes . however , almost half the population has to be considered poor , with dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities , where slightly more than 50 of the people reside . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a study carried out in 2008 by the angolan instituto nacional de estatística found that in rural areas roughly 58 must be classified as " poor " according to un norms but in the urban areas only 19 , and an overall rate of 37 . in cities , a majority of families , well beyond those officially classified as poor , must adopt a variety of survival strategies . in urban areas social inequality is most evident and it is extreme in luanda . in the human development index angola constantly ranks in the bottom group . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in january 2020 , a leak of government documents known as the luanda leaks showed that consulting companies such as boston consulting group , mckinsey company , and pricewaterhousecoopers had helped members of the family of former president josé eduardo dos santos ( especially his daughter isabel dos santos ) corruptly run sonangol for their own personal profit , helping them use the companys revenues to fund vanity projects in france and switzerland . after further revelations in the pandora papers , former generals dias and do nascimento and former presidential advisers were also accused of misappropriating significant public funds for personal benefit . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem for the angolan economy , illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in luanda and neighbouring bengo province , while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one of the economic consequences of social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in angolan private investments abroad . the small fringe of angolan society where most of the asset accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets , for reasons of security and profit . for the time being , the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in portugal where the angolan presence ( including the family of the state president ) in banks as well as in the domains of energy , telecommunications , and mass media has become notable , as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of tourism enterprises . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola has upgraded critical infrastructure , an investment made possible by funds from the nations development of oil resources . according to a report , just slightly more than ten years after the end of the civil war angolas standard of living has overall greatly improved . life expectancy , which was just 46 years in 2002 , reached 51 in 2011 . mortality rates for children fell from 25 per cent in 2001 to 19 per cent in 2010 and the number of students enrolled in primary school has tripled since 2001 . however , at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country for so long has not diminished , but has deepened in all respects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with a stock of assets corresponding to 70billion kz ( us6billion ) , angola is now the third - largest financial market in sub - saharan africa , surpassed only by nigeria and south africa . according to the angolan minister of economy , abraão gourgel , the financial market of the country grew modestly since 2002 and now occupies third place in sub - saharan africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on 19 december 2014 , the capital market in angola was launched . bodiva ( angola stock exchange and derivatives , in english ) was allocated the secondary public debt market , and was expected to launch the corporate debt market by 2015 , though the stock market itself was only expected to commence trading in 2016 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the economist reported in 2008 that diamonds and oil make up 60 of angolas economy , almost all of the countrys revenue and all of its dominant exports . growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed 1 moilbbl / d in late 2005 and was expected to grow to 2 moilbbl / d by 2007 . control of the oil industry is consolidated in sonangol group , a conglomerate owned by the angolan government . in december 2006 , angola was admitted as a member of opec . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to the heritage foundation , a conservative american think tank , oil production from angola has increased so significantly that angola now is chinas biggest supplier of oil . " china has extended three multi - billion dollar lines of credit to the angolan government ; two loans of 2 billion from china exim bank , one in 2004 , the second in 2007 , as well as one loan in 2005 of 2 billion from china international fund ltd . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break growing oil revenues also created opportunities for corruption : according to a recent human rights watch report , 32billion us dollars disappeared from government accounts in 2007–2010 . furthermore , sonangol , the state - run oil company , controls 51 of cabindas oil . due to this market control , the company ends up determining the profit received by the government and the taxes it pays . the council of foreign affairs states that the world bank mentioned that sonangol is a taxpayer , it carries out quasi - fiscal activities , it invests public funds , and , as concessionaire , it is a sector regulator . this multifarious work program creates conflicts of interest and characterises a complex relationship between sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2002 , angola demanded compensation for oil spills allegedly caused by chevron corporation , the first time it had fined a multinational corporation operating in its waters . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break operations in its diamond mines include partnerships between state - run endiama and mining companies such as alrosa which operate in angola . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break access to biocapacity in angola is higher than world average . in 2016 , angola had 1 global hectares of biocapacity per person within its territory , slightly more than world average of 1 global hectares per person . in 2016 , angola used 1 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their ecological footprint of consumption . this means they use about half as much biocapacity as angola contains . as a result , angola is running a biocapacity reserve . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agriculture and forestry is an area of potential opportunity for the country . the african economic outlook organization states that " angola requires 4 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55 of the maize it needs , 20 of the rice and just 5 of its required wheat " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " angola 2014 " retrieved from ' www . fricaneconomicoutlook . rg ' uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition , the world bank estimates that " less than 3 per cent of angolas abundant fertile land is cultivated and the economic potential of the forestry sector remains largely unexploited " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before independence in 1975 , angola was a bread - basket of southern africa and a major exporter of bananas , coffee and sisal , but three decades of civil war ( 1975–2002 ) destroyed fertile countryside , left it littered with landmines and drove millions into the cities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the country now depends on expensive food imports , mainly from south africa and portugal , while more than 90 of farming is done at the family and subsistence level . thousands of angolan small - scale farmers are trapped in poverty . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break transport in angola consists of : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola centers its port trade in five main ports : namibe , lobito , soyo , cabinda and luanda . the port of luanda is the largest of the five , as well as being one of the busiest on the african continent . bridge ' , ' in ' , ' benguela . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break travel on highways outside of towns and cities in angola ( and in some cases within ) is often not best advised for those without four - by - four vehicles . while reasonable road infrastructure has existed within angola , time and war have taken their toll on the road surfaces , leaving many severely potholed , littered with broken asphalt . in many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface , although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road . the angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the countrys roads . the road between lubango and namibe , for example , was completed recently with funding from the european union , and is comparable to many european main routes . completing the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades , but substantial efforts are already being made . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the telecommunications industry is considered one of the main strategic sectors in angola . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in october 2014 , the building of an optic fiber underwater cable was announced . this project aims to turn angola into a continental hub , thus improving internet connections both nationally and internationally . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on 11 march 2015 , the first angolan forum of telecommunications and information technology was held in luanda under the motto " the challenges of telecommunications in the current context of angola " , to promote debate on topical issues on telecommunications in angola and worldwide . a study of this sector , presented at the forum , said angola had the first telecommunications operator in africa to test lte – with speeds up to 400 mbit / s – and mobile penetration of about 75 ; there are about 3 million smartphones in the angolan market ; there are about 25000 km of optical fibre installed in the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first angolan satellite , angosat -

run space industry player roscosmos . the satellite payload was supplied by airbus defence space . due to an on - board power failure during solar panel deployment , on 27 december , rsc energia revealed that they lost communications contact with the satellite . although , subsequent attempts to restore communications with the satellite were successful , the satellite eventually stopped sending data and rsc energia confirmed that angosat - 1 was inoperable . the launch of angosat - 1 was aimed at ensuring telecommunications throughout the country . according to aristides safeca , secretary of state for telecommunications , the satellite was aimed at providing telecommunications services , tv , internet and e - government and was expected to remain in orbit " at best " for 18 years . a replacement satellite named angosat - 2 is in the works and was expected to be in service by 2020 . as of february 2021 , ango -

colonial fight in 1961 the portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro - independence sentiments . missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s , although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the catholic church and some major protestant denominations mostly keep to themselves in contrast to the " new churches " which actively proselytize . catholics , as well as some major protestant denominations , provide help for the poor in the form of crop seeds , farm animals , medical care and education . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break epidemics of cholera , malaria , rabies and african hemorrhagic fevers like marburg hemorrhagic fever , are common diseases in several parts of the country . many regions in this country have high incidence rates of tuberculosis and high hiv prevalence rates . dengue , filariasis , leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis ( river blindness ) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region . angola has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world and one of the worlds lowest life expectancies . a 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in angola . demographic and health surveys is currently conducting several surveys in angola on malaria , domestic violence and more . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in september 2014 , the angolan institute for cancer control ( iacc ) was created by presidential decree , and it will integrate the national health service in angola . the purpose of this new centre is to ensure health and medical care in oncology , policy implementation , programmes and plans for prevention and specialised treatment . this cancer institute will be assumed as a reference institution in the central and southern regions of africa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2014 , angola launched a national campaign of vaccination against measles , extended to every child under ten years old and aiming to go to all 18 provinces in the country . the measure is part of the strategic plan for the elimination of measles 2014–2020 created by the angolan ministry of health which includes strengthening routine immunisation , a proper dealing with measles cases , national campaigns , introducing a second dose of vaccination in the national routine vaccination calendar and active epidemiological surveillance for measles . this campaign took place together with the vaccination against polio and vitamin a supplementation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a yellow fever outbreak , the worst in the country in three decades began in december 2015 . by august 2016 , when the outbreak began to subside , nearly 4000 people were suspected of being infected . as many as 369 may have died . the outbreak began in the capital , luanda , and spread to at least 16 of the 18 provinces . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although by law education in angola is compulsory and free for eight years , the government reports that a percentage of pupils are not attending due to a lack of school buildings and teachers . pupils are often responsible for paying additional school -

*********** Article 82: Politics of Angola ***********

since the adoption of a new constitution in 2010 , the politics of angola takes place in a framework of a presidential republic , whereby the president of angola is both head of state and head of government , and of a multi - party system . executive power is exercised by the government . legislative power is vested in the president , the government and parliament . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola changed from a one - party marxist - leninist system ruled by the popular movement for the liberation of angola ( mpla ) , in place since independence in 1975 , to a multiparty democracy based on a new constitution adopted in 1992 . that same year the first parliamentary and presidential elections were held . the mpla won an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections . in the presidential elections , president josé eduardo dos santos won the first round election with more than 49 of the vote to jonas savimbis 40 . a runoff election would have been necessary , but never took place . the renewal of civil war immediately after the elections , which were considered as fraudulent by unita , and the collapse of the lusaka protocol , created a split situation . to a certain degree the new democratic institutions worked , notably the national assembly , with the active participation of unitas and the fnlas elected mps - while josé eduardo dos santos continued to exercise his functions without democratic legitimation . however the armed forces of the mpla ( now the official armed forces of the angolan state ) and of unita fought each other until the leader of unita , jonas savimbi , was killed in action in 2002 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 2002 to 2010 , the system as defined by the constitution of 1992 functioned in a relatively normal way . the executive branch of the government was composed of the president , the prime minister and council of ministers . the council of ministers , composed of all ministers and vice ministers , met regularly to discuss policy issues . governors of the 18 provinces were appointed by and served at the pleasure of the president . the constitutional law of 1992 established the broad outlines of government structure and the rights and duties of citizens . the legal system was based on portuguese and customary law but was weak and fragmented . courts operated in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities . a supreme court served as the appellate tribunal ; a constitutional court with powers of judicial review was never constituted despite statutory authorization . in practice , power was more and more concentrated in the hands of the president who , supported by an ever - increasing staff , largely controlled parliament , government , and the judiciary . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 26 - year - long civil war has ravaged the countrys political and social institutions . the un estimates of 1 million internally displaced persons ( idps ) , while generally the accepted figure for war - affected people is 4 million . daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically luanda ( population approximately 6 million ) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions . the ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions . hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment , schools are without books , and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day - to - day work . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 2010 constitution grants the president almost absolute power . elections for the national assembly are to take place every five years , and the president is automatically the leader of the winning party or coalition . it is for the president to appoint ( and dismiss ) all of the following : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the president is also provided a variety of powers , like defining the policy of the country . even though its not up to him / her to make laws ( only to promulgate them and make edicts ) , the president is the leader of the winning party . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the only " relevant " post that is not directly appointed by the president is the vice - president , which is the second in the winning party . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break josé eduardo dos santos stepped down as president of angola after 38 years in 2017 , being peacefully succeeded by joão lourenço , santos ' chosen successor . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the national assembly ( assembleia nacional ) has 223 members , elected for a four - year term , 130 members by proportional representation , 90 members in provincial districts , and 3 members to represent angolans abroad . the general elections in 1997 were rescheduled for 5 september 2008 . the ruling party mpla won 82 ( 191 seats in the national assembly ) and the main opposition party won only 10 ( 16 seats ) . the elections however have been described as only partly free but certainly not fair . a white book on the elections in 2008 lists up all irregularities surrounding the parliamentary elections of 2008 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break supreme court ( or " tribunal da relacao " ) judges of the supreme court are appointed by the president . the constitutional court , with the power of judicial review , contains 11 justices . four are appointed by the president , four by the national assembly , two by the superior council of the judiciary , and one elected by the public . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola has eighteen provinces : bengo , benguela , bie , cabinda , cuando cubango , cuanza norte , cuanza sul , cunene , huambo , huila , luanda , lunda norte , lunda sul , malanje , moxico , namibe , uige , zaire uvmr_ev_paragraph_break front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda or flec ( henrique nzita tiago ;

*********** Article 83: Economy of Angola ***********

the economy of angola remains heavily influenced by the effects of four decades of conflict in the last part of the 20th century , the war for independence from portugal ( 1961–75 ) and the subsequent civil war ( 1975–2002 ) . despite extensive oil and gas resources , diamonds , hydroelectric potential , and rich agricultural land , angola remains poor , and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture . since 2002 , when the 27 - year civil war ended , government policy prioritized the repair and improvement of infrastructure and strengthening of political and social institutions . during the first decade of the 21st century , angolas economy was one of the fastest - growing in the world , with reported annual average gdp growth of 11 percent from 2001 to 2010 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break corruption is rife throughout the economy and the country remains heavily dependent on the oil sector , which in 2017 accounted for over 90 percent of exports by value and 64 percent of government revenue . with the end of the oil boom , from 2015 angola entered into a period of economic contraction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the angolan economy has been dominated by the production of raw materials and the use of cheap labor since european rule began in the sixteenth century . the portuguese used angola principally as a source for the thriving slave trade across the atlantic ; luanda became the greatest slaving port in africa . after the portuguese empire abolished the slave trade in angola in 1858 , it began using concessional agreements , granting exclusive rights to a private company to exploit land , people , and all other resources within a given territory . in mozambique , this policy spawned a number of companies notorious for their exploitation of local labor . but in angola , only diamang showed even moderate success . at the same time , portuguese began emigrating to angola to establish farms and plantations ( fazendas ) to grow cash crops for export . although these farms were only partially successful before world war ii , they formed the basis for the later economic growth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the principal exports of the post - slave economy in the 19th century were rubber , beeswax , and ivory . prior to the first world war , exportation of coffee , palm kernels and oil , cattle , leather and hides , and salt fish joined the principal exports , with small quantities of gold and cotton also being produced . grains , sugar , and rum were also produced for local consumption . the principal imports were foodstuffs , cotton goods , hardware , and british coal . legislation against foreign traders was implemented in the 1890s . the territorys prosperity , however , continued to depend on plantations worked by labor " indentured " from the interior . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before world war ii , the portuguese government was concerned primarily with keeping its colonies self - sufficient and therefore invested little capital in angolas local economy . it built no roads until the mid - 1920s , and the first railroad , the benguela railway , was not completed until 1929 . between 1900 and 1940 , only 35000 portuguese emigrants settled in angola , and most worked in commerce in the cities , facilitating trade with portugal . in the rural areas , portuguese settlers often found it difficult to make a living because of fluctuating world prices for sugarcane and sisal and the difficulties in obtaining cheap labor to farm their crops . as a result , they often suspended their operations until the market prices rose and instead marketed the produce of angolan farmers . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break but in the wake of world war ii , the rapid growth of industrialization worldwide and the parallel requirements for raw materials led portugal to develop closer ties with its colonies and to begin actively developing the angolan economy . in the 1930s , portugal started to develop closer trade ties with its colonies , and by 1940 it absorbed 63 percent of angolan exports and accounted for 47 percent of angolan imports , up from 39 percent and 37 percent , respectively , a decade earlier . when the price of angolas principal crops—coffee and sisal—jumped after the war , the portuguese government began to reinvest some profits inside the country , initiating a series of projects to develop infrastructure . during the 1950s , portugal built dams , hydroelectric power stations , and transportation systems in addition , portuguese citizens were encouraged to emigrate to angola , where planned settlements ( colonatos ) were established for them in the rural areas . finally , the portuguese initiated mining operations for iron ore , manganese , and copper to complement industrial activities at home , and in 1955 the first successful oil wells were drilled in angola . by 1960 the angolan economy had been completely transformed , boasting a successful commercial agricultural sector , a promising mineral and petroleum production enterprise , and an incipient manufacturing industry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break yet by 1976 , these encouraging developments had been reversed . the economy was in complete disarray in the aftermath of the war of independence and the subsequent internal fighting of the liberation movements . according to the ruling mpla - pt , in august 1976 more than 80 percent of the agricultural plantations had been abandoned by their portuguese owners ; only 284 out of 692 factories continued to operate ; more than 30000 medium - level and high - level managers , technicians , and skilled workers had left the country ; and 2500 enterprises had been closed ( 75 percent of which had been abandoned by their owners ) . furthermore , only 8000 vehicles remained out of 153000 registered , dozens of bridges had been destroyed , the trading network was disrupted , administrative services did not exist , and files and studies were missing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angolas economic ills can also be traced to the legacy of portuguese colonial development . many of the white settlers had come to angola after 1950 and were understandably quick to repatriate during the war of independence . during their stay , however , these settlers had appropriated angolan lands , disrupting local peasant production of cash and subsistence crops . moreover , angolas industries depended on trade with portugal—the colonys overwhelmingly dominant trade partner—for both markets and machinery . only the petroleum and diamond industries boasted a wider clientele for investment and markets . most important , the portuguese had not trained angolans to operate the larger industrial or agricultural enterprises , nor had they actively educated the population . upon independence angola thus found itself without markets or expertise to maintain even minimal economic growth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as a result , the government intervened , nationalizing most businesses and farms abandoned by the portuguese . it established state farms to continue producing coffee , sugar , and sisal , and it took over the operations of all factories to maintain production . these attempts usually failed , primarily because of the lack of experienced managers and the continuing disruptions in rural areas caused by the unita insurgency . only the petroleum sector continued to operate successfully , and by 1980 this sector had helped the gross domestic product reach us3 billion , its highest level up to 1988 . in the face of serious economic problems and the continuing war throughout the countryside , in 1987 the government announced plans to liberalize economic policies and promote private investment and involvement in the economy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break united nations angola verification mission iii and monua spent us1billion overseeing implementation of the lusaka protocol , a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war . the protocol prohibited unita from buying foreign arms , a provision the united nations largely did not enforce , so both sides continued to build up their stockpile . unita purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in albania and bulgaria , and from zaire , south africa , republic of the congo , zambia , togo , and burkina faso . in october 1997 the un imposed travel sanctions on unita leaders , but the un waited until july 1998 to limit unitas exportation of diamonds and freeze unita bank accounts . while the government gave us250million to unita between 1986 and 1991 , unita made us1billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds , primarily through zaire to europe . at the same time the angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of belarus , brazil , bulgaria , china , and south africa . while no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol , no country informed the register on conventional weapons as required . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break despite the increase in civil warfare in late 1998 , the economy grew by an estimated 4 in 1999 . the government introduced new currency denominations in 1999 , including a 1 and 5 kwanza note . ite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an economic reform effort was launched in 1998 . ite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola produced over 3 e6carat of diamonds in 2003 , and production was expected to grow to 10 e6carat per year by 2007 . in 2004 , chinas eximbank approved a 2billion line of credit to angola to rebuild infrastructure . the economy grew 18 in 2005 and growth was expected to reach 26 in 2006 and stay above 10 for the rest of the decade . by 2020 , angola had a national debt of 76 billion , of which 20 billion is to china . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the construction industry is taking advantage of the growing economy , with various housing projects stimulated by the government initiatives for example the angola investe program and the casa feliz or meña projects . not all public construction projects are functional . a case in point : kilamba kiaxi , where a whole new satellite town of luanda , consisting of housing facilities for several hundreds of thousands of people , was completely uninhabited for over four years because of skyrocketing prices , but completely sold out after the government decreased the original price and created mortgage plans at around the election time thus made it affordable for middle - class people . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break chevrontexaco started pumping 50 koilbbl / d from block 14 in january 2000 , but production decreased to 57 koilbbl / d in 2007 due to poor - quality oil . angola joined the organization of the petroleum exporting countries on january 1 , 2007 . cabinda gulf oil company found malange -

2005 and which is expected to grow to 2 moilbbl / d by 2007 . control of the oil industry is consolidated in sonangol group , a conglomerate owned by the angolan government . with revenues booming from oil exports , the government has started to implement ambitious development programs to build roads and other basic infrastructure for the nation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the last decade of the colonial period , angola was a major african food exporter but now imports almost all its food . severe wartime conditions , including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside , have brought agricultural activities to a near - standstill . some efforts to recover have gone forward , however , notably in fisheries . coffee production , though a fraction of its pre - 1975 level , is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports . expanding oil production is now almost half of gdp and 90 of exports , at 800 koilbbl / d . diamonds provided much of the revenue for jonas savimbis unita rebellion through illicit trade . other rich resources await development : gold , forest products , fisheries , iron ore , coffee , and fruits . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this is a chart of trend of nominal gross domestic product of angola at market prices using international monetary fund data ; figures are in millions of units . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2017 . inflation below 5 is in green . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola produced , in 2018 : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products , like coffee ( 16 thousand tons ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break exports in 2004 reached us10530764911 . the vast majority of angolas exports , 92 in 2004 , are petroleum products . us785million worth of diamonds , 7 of exports , were sold abroad that year . nearly all of angolas oil goes to the united states , 526 koilbbl / d in 2006 , making it the eighth largest supplier of oil to the united states , and to china , 477 koilbbl / d in 2006 . in the first quarter of 2008 , angola became the main exporter of oil to china . the rest of its petroleum exports go to europe and latin america . from the 2000s , many chinese have settled and started up businesses . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola produces and exports more petroleum than any other nation in sub - saharan africa , surpassing nigeria in the 2000s . in january 2007 angola became a member of opec . by 2010 production is expected to double the 2006 output level with development of deep - water offshore oil fields . oil sales generated us1billion in tax revenue in 2004 and now makes up 80 of the governments budget , a 5 increase from 2003 , and 45 of gdp . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break chevron corporation produces and receives 400 koilbbl / d , 27 of angolan oil . total , exxonmobil , eni , petrobras and bp also operate in the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break block zero provides the majority of angolas crude oil production with 370 koilbbl / d produced annually . the largest fields in block zero are takula ( area a ) , numbi ( area a ) , and kokongo ( area b ) . chevron operates in block zero with a 39 share . sonangol , the state oil company , total , and eni own the rest of the block . chevron also operates angolas first producing deepwater section , block 14 , with 57 koilbbl / d . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the united nations has criticized the angolan government for using torture , rape , summary executions , arbitrary detention , and disappearances , actions which angolan government has justified on the need to maintain oil output . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break angola is the third -

lying location , commanded by hills on the kentucky side of the river . fort donelson on the cumberland river , although in a better location , had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break maj . gen . polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command . after johnston took command , polk at first refused to comply with johnstons order to send an engineer , lt . joseph dixon , to inspect the forts . after johnston asserted his authority , polk had to allow dixon to proceed . dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened , although they were not in ideal locations , because much work had been done on them and the confederates might not have time to build new ones . johnston accepted his recommendations . johnston wanted major alexander stewart to command the forts but president davis appointed brig . gen . lloyd tilghman as commander . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to prevent polk from dissipating his forces by allowing some men to join a partisan group , johnston ordered him to send brig . gen . gideon pillow and 5000 men to fort donelson . pillow took up a position at nearby clarksville , tennessee and did not move into the fort until february 7 , 1862 . alerted by a union reconnaissance on january 14 , 1862 , johnston ordered tilghman to fortify the high ground opposite fort henry , which polk had failed to do despite johnstons orders . tilghman failed to act decisively on these orders , which in any event were too late to be adequately carried out . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gen . beauregard arrived at johnstons headquarters at bowling green on february 4 , 1862 , and was given overall command of polks force at the western end of johnstons line at columbus , kentucky . on february 6 , 1862 , union navy gunboats quickly reduced the defenses of ill - sited fort henry , inflicting 21 casualties on the small remaining confederate force . brig . gen . lloyd tilghman surrendered the 94 remaining officers and men of his approximately 3000 - man force which had not been sent to fort donelson before grants force could even take up their positions . johnston knew he could be trapped at bowling green if fort donelson fell , so he moved his force to nashville , the capital of tennessee and an increasingly important confederate industrial center , beginning on february 11 , 1862 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break johnston also reinforced fort donelson with 12000 more men , including those under floyd and pillow , a curious decision in view of his thought that the union gunboats alone might be able to take the fort . the senior generals sent to the fort to command the enlarged garrison , gideon pillow and john floyd , squandered their chance to avoid having to surrender most of the garrison and on february 16 , 1862 , brig . gen . simon buckner , having been abandoned by floyd and pillow , surrendered fort donelson . colonel nathan bedford forrest escaped with his cavalry force of about 700 men before the surrender . the confederates suffered about 1500 casualties with an estimated 12000 to 14000 taken prisoner . union casualties were 500 killed , 2108 wounded , 224 missing . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break johnston , who had little choice in allowing floyd and pillow to take charge at fort donelson on the basis of seniority after he ordered them to add their forces to the garrison , took the blame and suffered calls for his removal because a full explanation to the press and public would have exposed the weakness of the confederate position . his passive defensive performance while positioning himself in a forward position at bowling green , spreading his forces too thinly , not concentrating his forces in the face of union advances , and appointing or relying upon inadequate or incompetent subordinates subjected him to criticism at the time and by later historians . the fall of the forts exposed nashville to imminent attack , and it fell without resistance to union forces under brig . gen . buell on february 25 , 1862 , two days after johnston had to pull his forces out in order to avoid having them captured as well . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break johnston had various remaining military units scattered throughout his territory and retreating to the south to avoid being cut off . johnston himself retreated with the force under his personal command , the army of central kentucky , from the vicinity of nashville . johnston decided to concentrate forces with those formerly under polk and now already under beauregards command at the strategically located railroad crossroads of corinth , mississippi , which he reached by a circuitous route . johnston kept the union forces , now under the overall command of the ponderous maj . gen . henry halleck , confused and hesitant to move , allowing johnston to reach his objective undetected . this delay allowed jefferson davis finally to send reinforcements from the garrisons of coastal cities and another highly rated but prickly general , braxton bragg , to help organize the western forces . bragg at least calmed the nerves of beauregard and polk , who had become agitated by their apparent dire situation in the face of numerically superior forces , before johnstons arrival on march 24 , 1862 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break johnstons army of 17000 men gave the confederates a combined force of about 40000 to 44669 men at corinth . on march 29 , 1862 , johnston officially took command of this combined force , which continued to use the army of the mississippi name under which it had been organized by beauregard on march 5 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break johnston now planned to defeat the union forces piecemeal before the various union units in kentucky and tennessee under grant with 40000 men at nearby pittsburg landing , tennessee , and the now maj . gen . don carlos buell on his way from nashville with 35000 men , could unite against him . due to the delays , as well as several contacts with the enemy , johnstons second in command , beauregard , felt the element of surprise had been lost and recommended calling off the attack . johnston decided to proceed as planned , stating " i would fight them if they were a million . " his army was finally in position within a mile or two of grants force , and undetected , by the evening of april 5 , 1862 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break johnston launched a massive surprise attack with his concentrated forces against grant at the battle of shiloh on april 6 , 1862 . as the confederate forces overran the union camps , johnston personally rallied troops up and down the line on his horse . one of his famous moments in the battle occurred when he witnessed some of his soldiers breaking from the ranks to pillage and loot the union camps , and was outraged to see a young lieutenant among them . " none of that , sir " , johnston roared at the officer , " we are not here for plunder . " then , realizing he had embarrassed the man , he picked up a tin cup from a table and announced , " let this be my share of the spoils today " , before directing his army onward . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at about 2 : 30pm , while leading one of those charges against a union camp near the " peach orchard " , he was wounded , taking a bullet behind his right knee . the bullet clipped a part of his popliteal artery and his boot filled up with blood . there were no medical personnel on scene at the time , since johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded confederate troops and union prisoners earlier in the battle . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break within a few minutes , johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting . among his staff was isham harris , the governor of tennessee , who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that abraham lincoln had appointed andrew johnson as military governor of tennessee . seeing johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale , harris asked : " general , are you wounded ? " johnston glanced down at his leg wound , then faced harris and replied in a weak voice his last words : " yes and i fear seriously . " harris and other staff officers removed johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the " hornets nest " and desperately tried to aid the general , who had lost consciousness by this point . harris then sent an aide to fetch johnstons surgeon but did not apply a tourniquet to johnsons wounded leg . a few minutes later , before a doctor could be found , johnston died from blood loss . it is believed that johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound . ironically , it was later discovered that johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket when he died . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break harris and the other officers wrapped general johnstons body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops ' morale with the sight of the dead general . johnston and his wounded horse , fire eater , were taken to his field headquarters on the corinth road , where his body remained in his tent for the remainder of the battle . beauregard assumed command of the army and resumed leading the confederate assault , which continued advancing and pushed the union force back to a final defensive line near the tennessee river . with his army exhausted and daylight almost gone , beauregard called off the final confederate attack around 1900 hours , figuring he could finish off the union army the following morning . however , grant was reinforced by 20000 fresh troops from don carlos buells army of the ohio during the night , and led a successful counter - attack the following day , driving the confederates from the field and winning the battle . as the confederate army retreated back to corinth , johnstons body was taken to the home of colonel william inge , which had been his headquarters in corinth . it was covered in the confederate flag and lay in state for several hours . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it is possible that a confederate soldier fired the fatal round , as many confederates were firing at the union lines while johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers . alonzo ridley of los angeles commanded the bodyguard “the guides” of gen . johnston , and was by his side when he fell . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break johnston was the highest - ranking fatality of the war on either side , and his death was a strong blow to the morale of the confederacy . at the time , davis considered him the best general in the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break johnston was survived by his wife eliza and six children . his wife and five younger children , including one born after he went to war , chose to live out their days at home in los angeles with elizas brother , dr . john strother griffin . johnstons eldest son , albert sidney jr . ( born in texas ) , had already followed him into the confederate states army . in 1863 , after taking home leave in los angeles , albert jr . was on his way out of san pedro harbor on a ferry . while a steamer was taking on passengers from the ferry , a wave swamped the smaller boat , causing its boilers to explode . albert jr . was killed in the accident . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break upon his passing general johnston received the highest praise ever given by the confederate government : accounts were published , on december 20 , 1862 , and thereafter , in the los angeles star of his familys hometown . johnston street , hancock street , and griffin avenue , each in northeast los angeles , are named after the general and his family , who lived in the neighborhood . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break johnston was initially buried in new orleans . in 1866 , a joint resolution of the texas legislature was passed to have his body moved and reinterred at the texas state cemetery in austin . the re - interment occurred in 1867 . forty years later , the state appointed elisabet ney to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at the grave site , installed in 1905 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the texas historical commission has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once johnstons plantation . an adjacent marker was erected by the san jacinto chapter of the daughters of the republic of texas and the lee , roberts , and davis chapter of the united daughters of the confederate states of america . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1916 , the university of texas at austin recognized several confederate veterans ( including johnston ) with statues on its south mall . on august 21 , 2017 , as part of the wave of confederate monument removals in america , johnstons statue was taken down . plans were announced to add it to the briscoe center for american history on the east side of the university campus . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break johnston was inducted to the texas military hall of honor in 1980 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the fall of 2018 , johnston elementary school in dallas , texas , was renamed cedar crest elementary . johnston middle school in houston , texas was also renamed to meyerland middle school . three additional elementary schools named for confederate veterans were renamed at the same time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an android is a humanoid robot or other artificial being often made from a flesh - like material . humanoid robots . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while the term " android " is used in reference to human - looking robots in general ( not necessarily male - looking humanoid robots ) , a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as a gynoid . besides one can refer to robots without alluding to their sexual appearance by calling them anthrobots ( merging the radical anthrōpos and the word robot ; see anthrobotics ) or anthropoids ( short for anthropoid robots ; the term humanoids is not appropriate because it is already commonly used to refer to human - like organic species in the context of scientific fiction , futurism and speculative astrobiology ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the oxford english dictionary traces the earliest use ( as " androides " ) to ephraim chambers ' 1728 cyclopaedia , in reference to an automaton that st . albertus magnus allegedly created . by the late 1700s , " androides " , elaborate mechanical devices resembling humans performing human activities , were displayed in exhibit halls . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term " android " appears in us patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human - like toy automatons . the term android was used in a more modern sense by the french author auguste villiers de lisle - adam in his work tomorrows eve ( 1886 ) . this story features an artificial humanlike robot named hadaly . as said by the officer in the story , " in this age of realien advancement , who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls . " the term made an impact into english pulp science fiction starting from jack williamsons the cometeers ( 1936 ) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by edmond hamiltons captain future stories ( 1940–1944 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although karel čapeks robots in ( rossums universal robots ) ( 1921 ) —the play that introduced the word robot to the world—were organic artificial humans , the word " robot " has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans , animals , and other beings . the term " android " can mean either one of these , while a cyborg ( " cybernetic organism " or " bionic man " ) would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term " droid " , popularized by george lucas in the original star wars film and now used widely within science fiction , originated as an abridgment of " android " , but has been used by lucas and others to mean any robot , including distinctly non - human form machines like r2 - d2 . the word " android " was used in star trek : the original series episode " what are little girls made of ? " the abbreviation " andy " , coined as a pejorative by writer philip dick in his novel do androids dream of electric sheep ? has seen some further usage , such as within the tv series total recall 2070 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break authors have used the term android in more diverse ways than robot or cyborg . in some fictional works , the difference between a robot and android is only superficial , with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot - like internal mechanics . in other stories , authors have used the word " android " to mean a wholly organic , yet artificial , creation . other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break eric wilson , who defines an android as a " synthetic human being " , distinguishes between three types of android , based on their bodys composition : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots , the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts : simulacra ( devices that exhibit likeness ) and automata ( devices that have independence ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break several projects aiming to create androids that look , and , to a certain degree , speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break japanese robotics have been leading the field since the 1970s . waseda university initiated the wabot project in 1967 , and in 1972 completed the wabot - 1 , the first android , a full - scale humanoid intelligent robot . its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs , and to grip and transport objects with hands , using tactile sensors . its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors , artificial eyes and ears . and its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in japanese , with an artificial mouth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1984 , wabot - 2 was revealed , and made a number of improvements . it was capable of playing the organ . wabot - 2 had ten fingers and two feet , and was able to read a score of music . it was also able to accompany a person . in 1986 , honda began its humanoid research and development program , to create humanoid robots capable of interacting successfully with humans . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the intelligent robotics lab , directed by hiroshi ishiguro at osaka university , and the kokoro company demonstrated the actroid at expo 2005 in aichi prefecture , japan and released the telenoid r1 in 2010 . in 2006 , kokoro developed a new der 2 android . the height of the human body part of der2 is 165cm . there are 47 mobile points . der2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body . the " air servosystem " which kokoro developed originally is used for the actuator . as a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem , the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise . der2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder . outwardly der2 has a more beautiful proportion . compared to the previous model , der2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions . once programmed , it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the intelligent mechatronics lab , directed by hiroshi kobayashi at the tokyo university of science , has developed an android head called saya , which was exhibited at robodex 2002 in yokohama , japan . there are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time , which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future . now saya is working at the science university of tokyo as a guide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the waseda university ( japan ) and ntt docomos manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape - shifting robot wd - 2 . it is capable of changing its face . at first , the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline , eyes , nose , and so on of a certain person . the robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions , they say . the first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003 . after that , a year later , they made a couple of major improvements to the design . the robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy . it uses a driving system with a 3dof unit . the wd - 2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask , with each point possessing three degrees of freedom . this one has 17 facial points , for a total of 56 degrees of freedom . as for the materials they used , the wd - 2 ' s mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called septom , with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength . other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point , driven by a dc motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw . apparently , the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces . to " copy " a face , they need only a 3d scanner to determine the locations of an individuals 17 facial points . after that , they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards . in addition , the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individuals hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3d mask . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break prof nadia thalmann , a nanyang technological university scientist , directed efforts of the institute for media innovation along with the school of computer engineering in the development of a social robot , nadine . nadine is powered by software similar to apples siri or microsofts cortana . nadine may become a personal assistant in offices and homes in future , or she may become a companion for the young and the elderly . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break assoc prof gerald seet from the school of mechanical aerospace engineering and the beingthere centre led a three -

tech company for barry to help improve education quality and eliminate education poverty . maria bot is designed to create new ways for students to engage and discuss ethical issues raised by the increasing presence of robots and artificial intelligence . barry also uses maria bot to demonstrate that programming a robot with life - affirming , ethical framework makes them more likely to help humans to do the same . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break maria bot is an ambassador robot for good and ethical ai technology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break hanson robotics , inc . of texas and kaist produced an android portrait of albert einstein , using hansons facial android technology mounted on kaists life -

fi author philip dick ( creator of do androids dream of electric sheep ? the basis for the film blade runner ) , with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the authors works . in 2005 , the pkd android won a first - place artificial intelligence award from aaai . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break androids are a staple of science fiction . isaac asimov pioneered the fictionalization of the science of robotics and artificial intelligence , notably in his 1950s series i , robot . one thing common to most fictional androids is that the real - life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human - like robots—such as the creation of strong artificial intelligence—are assumed to have been solved . fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans—moving , thinking and speaking as fluidly as them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance—or even human ambitions—of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions . some android heroes seek , like pinocchio , to become human , as in the film bicentennial man , or data in star trek : the next generation . others , as in the film westworld , rebel against abuse by careless humans . android hunter deckard in do androids dream of electric sheep ? and its film adaptation blade runner discovers that his targets appear to be , in some ways , more " human " than he is . android stories , therefore , are not essentially stories " about " androids ; they are stories about the human condition and what it means to be human . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring racism in society , as in blade runner . perhaps the clearest example of this is john brunners 1968 novel into the slave nebula , where the blue - skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human . more recently , the androids bishop and annalee call in the films aliens and alien resurrection are used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an " other " . the 2018 video game detroit : become human also explores how androids are treated as second class citizens in a near future society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break female androids , or " gynoids " , are often seen in science fiction , and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical " perfect woman " . examples include the greek myth of pygmalion and the female robot maria in fritz langs metropolis . some gynoids , like pris in blade runner , are designed as sex - objects , with the intent of " pleasing mens violent sexual desires " , or as submissive , servile companions , such as in the stepford wives . fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing " essentialist ideas of femininity " , although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism and misogyny in society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 2015 japanese film sayonara , starring geminoid f , was promoted as " the first movie to feature an android performing opposite a human actor " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

right progressive conservatives held office continually from 1971 to 2015 , the latter being the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial or federal level in canadian history . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before becoming part of canada , alberta was home to several first nations like plain indians and woodland cree . it was also a territory used by fur traders of the rival companies hbc and nwc . the dominion of canada bought the lands that would become alberta as part of the nwt in 1870 . from the late 1800s to early 1900s , many immigrants arrived to prevent the prairies from being annexed by the us . growing wheat and cattle ranching also became very profitable . in 1905 , the alberta act was passed , creating the province of alberta . massive oil reserves were discovered in 1947 . the exploitation of oil sands began in 1967 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta is renowned for its natural beauty , richness in fossils and for housing important nature reserves . alberta is home to six unesco designated world heritage sites : the canadian rocky mountain parks , dinosaur provincial park , the head -

germanic language aþalaberhtaz ( compound of " noble " " bright / famous " ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta , with an area of , is the fourth - largest province after quebec , ontario and british columbia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albertas southern border is the 49th parallel north , which separates it from the state of montana . the 60th parallel north divides alberta from the northwest territories . the 110th meridian west separates it from the province of saskatchewan ; while on the west its boundary with british columbia follows the 120th meridian west south from the northwest territories at 60°n until it reaches the continental divide at the rocky mountains , and from that point follows the line of peaks marking the continental divide in a generally southeasterly direction until it reaches the montana border at 49°n . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the province extends north to south and east to west at its maximum width . its highest point is at the summit of mount columbia in the rocky mountains along the southwest border while its lowest point is on the slave river in wood buffalo national park in the northeast . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the exception of the semi - arid climate of the steppe in the south - eastern section , the province has adequate water resources . there are numerous rivers and lakes in alberta used for swimming , fishing and a range of water sports . there are three large lakes , lake claire in wood buffalo national park , lesser slave lake , and lake athabasca , which lies in both alberta and saskatchewan . the longest river in the province is the athabasca river , which travels from the columbia icefield in the rocky mountains to lake athabasca . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the largest river is the peace river with an average flow of . the peace river originates in the rocky mountains of northern british columbia and flows through northern alberta and into the slave river , a tributary of the mackenzie river . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albertas capital city , edmonton , is located at about the geographic centre of the province . it is the most northerly major city in canada and serves as a gateway and hub for resource development in northern canada . with its proximity to canadas largest oil fields , the region has most of western canadas oil refinery capacity . calgary is about south of edmonton and north of montana , surrounded by extensive ranching country . almost 75 of the provinces population lives in the calgary–edmonton corridor . the land grant policy to the railways served as a means to populate the province in its early years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most of the northern half of the province is boreal forest , while the rocky mountains along the southwestern boundary are largely temperate coniferous forests of the alberta mountain forests and alberta–british columbia foothills forests . the southern quarter of the province is prairie , ranging from shortgrass prairie in the southeastern corner to mixed grass prairie in an arc to the west and north of it . the central aspen parkland region extending in a broad arc between the prairies and the forests , from calgary , north to edmonton , and then east to lloydminster , contains the most fertile soil in the province and most of the population . much of the unforested part of alberta is given over either to grain or to dairy farming , with mixed farming more common in the north and centre , while ranching and irrigated agriculture predominate in the south . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the alberta badlands are located in southeastern alberta , where the red deer river crosses the flat prairie and farmland , and features deep canyons and striking landforms dinosaur provincial park , near brooks , showcases the badlands terrain , desert flora , and remnants from albertas past when dinosaurs roamed the then lush landscape . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta extends for over from north to south ; its climate , therefore , varies considerably . average high temperatures in january range from in the southwest to in the far north . the presence of the rocky mountains also influences the climate to the southwest , which disrupts the flow of the prevailing westerly winds and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province , casting a rain shadow over much of alberta . the northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the pacific ocean cause alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean . annual precipitation ranges from in the southeast to in the north , except in the foothills of the rocky mountains where total precipitation including snowfall can reach annually . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break northern alberta is mostly covered by boreal forest and has a subarctic climate . the agricultural area of southern alberta has a semi - arid steppe climate because the annual precipitation is less than the water that evaporates or is used by plants . the southeastern corner of alberta , part of the palliser triangle , experiences greater summer heat and lower rainfall than the rest of the province , and as a result , suffers frequent crop yield problems and occasional severe droughts . western alberta is protected by the mountains and enjoys the mild temperatures brought by winter chinook winds . central and parts of northwestern alberta in the peace river region are largely aspen parkland , a biome transitional between prairie to the south and boreal forest to the north . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta has a humid continental climate with warm summers and cold winters . the province is open to cold arctic weather systems from the north , which often produce cold winter conditions . as the fronts between the air masses shift north and south across alberta , the temperature can change rapidly . arctic air masses in the winter produce extreme minimum temperatures varying from in northern alberta to in southern alberta , although temperatures at these extremes are rare . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the summer , continental air masses have produced record maximum temperatures from in the mountains to over in southeastern alberta . alberta is a sunny province . annual bright sunshine totals range between 1900 up to just under 2600 hours per year . northern alberta gets about 18 hours of daylight in the summer . the average daytime temperatures range from around in the rocky mountain valleys and far north , up to around in the dry prairie of the southeast . the northern and western parts of the province experience higher rainfall and lower evaporation rates caused by cooler summer temperatures . the south and east - central portions are prone to drought - like conditions sometimes persisting for several years , although even these areas can receive heavy precipitation , sometimes resulting in flooding . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the winter , the alberta clipper , a type of intense , fast - moving winter storm that generally forms over or near the province and , pushed with great speed by the continental polar jetstream , descends over the rest of southern canada and the northern tier of the united states . in southwestern alberta , the cold winters are frequently interrupted by warm , dry chinook winds blowing from the mountains , which can propel temperatures upward from frigid conditions to well above the freezing point in a very short period . during one chinook recorded at pincher creek , temperatures soared from in just one hour . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after saskatchewan , alberta experiences the most tornadoes in canada with an average of 15 verified per year . thunderstorms , some of them severe , are frequent in the summer , especially in central and southern alberta . the region surrounding the calgary–edmonton corridor is notable for having the highest frequency of hail in canada , which is caused by orographic lifting from the nearby rocky mountains , enhancing the updraft / downdraft cycle necessary for the formation of hail . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in central and northern alberta the arrival of spring is marked by the early flowering of the prairie crocus ( pulsatilla nuttalliana ) anemone ; this member of the buttercup family has been recorded flowering as early as march , though april is the usual month for the general population . other prairie flora known to flower early are the golden bean ( thermopsis rhombifolia ) and wild rose ( rosa acicularis ) . members of the sunflower ( helianthus ) family blossom on the prairie in the summer months between july and september . the southern and east central parts of alberta are covered by short prairie grass , which dries up as summer lengthens , to be replaced by hardy perennials such as the prairie coneflower ( ratibida ) , fleabane , and sage ( artemisia ) . both yellow and white sweet clover ( melilotus ) can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides . these are largely deciduous , typically aspen , poplar , and willow . many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain . north of the north saskatchewan river , evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres . aspen poplar , balsam poplar ( populus balsamifera ) ( or in some parts cottonwood ( populus deltoides ) , and paper birch ( betula papyrifera ) are the primary large deciduous species . conifers include jack pine ( pinus banksiana ) , rocky mountain pine , lodgepole pine ( pinus contorta ) , both white and black spruce , and the deciduous conifer tamarack ( larix laricina ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the four climatic regions ( alpine , boreal forest , parkland , and prairie ) of alberta are home to many different species of animals . the south and central prairie was the homeland of the american bison , also known as buffalo , with its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo . the buffalo population was decimated during early settlement , but since then , buffalo have made a comeback , living on farms and in parks all over alberta . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break herbivores are found throughout the province . moose , mule deer , elk , and white - tailed deer are found in the wooded regions , and pronghorn can be found in the prairies of southern alberta . bighorn sheep and mountain goats live in the rocky mountains . rabbits , porcupines , skunks , squirrels , and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province . alberta is home to only one venomous snake species , the prairie rattlesnake . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta is home to many large carnivores such as wolves , grizzly bears , black bears , and mountain lions , which are found in the mountains and wooded regions . smaller carnivores of the canine and feline families include coyotes , red foxes , canada lynx , and bobcats . wolverines can also be found in the northwestern areas of the province . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break central and northern alberta and the region farther north are the nesting ground of many migratory birds . vast numbers of ducks , geese , swans and pelicans arrive in alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern alberta . eagles , hawks , owls , and crows are plentiful , and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect - eating birds can be found . alberta , like other temperate regions , is home to mosquitoes , flies , wasps , and bees . rivers and lakes are populated with pike , walleye , whitefish , rainbow , speckled , brown trout , and sturgeon . native to the province , the bull trout , is the provincial fish and an official symbol of alberta . turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province . frogs and salamanders are a few of the amphibians that make their homes in alberta . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta is the only province in canada—as well as one of the few places in the world—that is free of norwegian rats . since the early 1950s , the government of alberta has operated a rat - control program , which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported , usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail . in 2006 , alberta agriculture reported zero findings of wild rats ; the only rat interceptions have been domesticated rats that have been seized from their owners . it is illegal for individual albertans to own or keep norwegian rats of any description ; the animals can only be kept in the province by zoos , universities and colleges , and recognized research institutions . in 2009 , several rats were uvmr_ev_paragraph_break found and captured , in small pockets in southern alberta , putting albertas rat - free status in jeopardy . a colony of rats was subsequently found in a landfill near medicine hat in 2012 and again in 2014 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta has one of the greatest diversities and abundances of late cretaceous dinosaur fossils worldwide . taxa are represented by complete fossil skeletons , isolated material , microvertebrate remains , and even mass graves . at least 38 dinosaur type specimens were collected in the province . the foremost formation , oldman formation and dinosaur park formations collectively comprise the judith river group and are the most thoroughly studied dinosaur - bearing strata in alberta . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break dinosaur - bearing strata are distributed widely throughout alberta . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break paleo - indians arrived in alberta at least 10000 years ago , toward the end of the last ice age . they are thought to have migrated from siberia to alaska on a land bridge across the bering strait and then possibly moved down the east side of the rocky mountains through alberta to settle the americas . others may have migrated down the coast of british columbia and then moved inland . over time they differentiated into various first nations peoples , including the plains indians of southern alberta such as those of the blackfoot confederacy and the plains cree , who generally lived by hunting buffalo , and the more northerly tribes such as the woodland cree and chipewyan who hunted , trapped , and fished for a living . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the british arrival in canada , approximately half of the province of alberta , south of the athabasca river drainage , became part of ruperts land which consisted of all land drained by rivers flowing into hudson bay . this area was granted by charles ii of england to the hudsons bay company ( hbc ) in 1670 , and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the athabasca river and the rivers north of it were not in hbc territory because they drained into the arctic ocean instead of hudson bay , and they were prime habitats for fur - bearing animals . the first european explorer of the athabasca region was peter pond , who learned of the methye portage , which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of ruperts land . other north american fur traders formed the north west company ( nwc ) of montreal to compete with the hbc in 1779 . the nwc occupied the northern part of alberta territory . peter pond built fort athabasca on lac la biche in 1778 . roderick mackenzie built fort chipewyan on lake athabasca ten years later in 1788 . his cousin , sir alexander mackenzie , followed the north saskatchewan river to its northernmost point near edmonton , then setting northward on foot , trekked to the athabasca river , which he followed to lake athabasca . it was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name—the mackenzie river—which he followed to its outlet in the arctic ocean . returning to lake athabasca , he followed the peace river upstream , eventually reaching the pacific ocean , and so he became the first european to cross the north american continent north of mexico . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the extreme southernmost portion of alberta was part of the french ( and spanish ) territory of louisiana and was sold to the united states in 1803 . in the treaty of 1818 , the portion of louisiana north of the forty - ninth parallel was ceded to great britain . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break fur trade expanded in the north , but bloody battles occurred between the rival hbc and nwc , and in 1821 the british government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities . the amalgamated hudsons bay company dominated trade in alberta until 1870 when the newly formed canadian government purchased ruperts land . northern alberta was included in the north - western territory until 1870 , when it and ruperts land became canadas north - west territories . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break first nations negotiated the numbered treaties with the crown in which the crown gained title to the land that would later become alberta , and the crown committed to the ongoing support of the first nations and guaranteed their hunting and fishing rights . the most significant treaties for alberta are treaty 6 ( 1876 ) , treaty 7 ( 1877 ) and treaty 8 ( 1899 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the district of alberta was created as part of the north - west territories in 1882 . as settlement increased , local representatives to the north - west legislative assembly were added . after a long campaign for autonomy , in 1905 , the district of alberta was enlarged and given provincial status , with the election of alexander cameron rutherford as the first premier . less than a decade later , the first world war presented special challenges to the new province as an extraordinary number of volunteers left relatively few workers to maintain services and production . over 50 of albertas doctors volunteered for service overseas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on june 21 , 2013 , during the 2013 alberta floods alberta experienced heavy rainfall that triggered catastrophic flooding throughout much of the southern half of the province along the bow , elbow , highwood and oldman rivers and tributaries . a dozen municipalities in southern alberta declared local states of emergency on june 21 as water levels rose and numerous communities were placed under evacuation orders . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2016 , the fort mcmurray wildfire resulted in the largest fire evacuation of residents in albertas history , as more than 80000 people were ordered to evacuate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since 2020 , alberta has been affected by the covid - 19 pandemic . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 2021 canadian census reported alberta had a population of 4262635 living in 1633220 of its 1772670 total dwellings , an 4 change from its 2016 population of 4067175 . with a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021 . statistics canada estimated the province to have a population of 4464170 in q4 of 2021 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since 2000 , albertas population has experienced a relatively high rate of growth , mainly because of its burgeoning economy . between 2003 and 2004 , the province had high birthrates ( on par with some larger provinces such as british columbia ) , relatively high immigration , and a high rate of interprovincial migration compared to other provinces . in 2016 , alberta continued to have the youngest population among the provinces with a median age of 36 years , compared with the national median of 41 years . also in 2016 , alberta had the smallest proportion of seniors ( 12 ) among the provinces and one of the highest population shares of children ( 19 ) , further contributing to albertas young and growing population . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break about 81 of the population lives in urban areas and only about 19 in rural areas . the calgary–edmonton corridor is the most urbanized area in the province and is one of the most densely populated areas of canada . many of albertas cities and towns have experienced very high rates of growth in recent history . albertas population rose from 73022 in 1901 to 3290350 according to the 2006 census . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to the 2016 census alberta has 779155 residents ( 19 ) between the ages of 0–14 , 2787805 residents ( 68 ) between the ages of 15–64 , and 500215 residents ( 12 ) aged 65 and over . english is the most common mother tongue , with 2991485 native speakers . this is followed by tagalog , with 99035 speakers , german , with 80050 speakers , french , with 72150 native speakers , and hindi , with 68695 speakers . 253460 residents identify as aboriginal , including 136585 as first nations , 114370 as métis , and 2500 as inuit . there are also 933165 residents who identify as a visible minority , including 230930 south asian people , 166195 filipinos , and 158200 chinese respondents . 1769500 residents hold a postsecondary certificate , diploma or degree , 895885 residents have obtained a secondary ( high ) school diploma or equivalency certificate , and 540665 residents do not have any certificate , diploma or degree . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the 2006 census found that english , with 2576670 native speakers , was the most common mother tongue of albertans , representing 79 of the population . the next most common mother tongues were chinese with 97275 native speakers ( 3 ) , followed by german with 84505 native speakers ( 2 ) and french with 61225 ( 1 ) . other mother tongues include : punjabi , with 36320 native speakers ( 1 ) ; tagalog , with 29740 ( 0 ) ; ukrainian , with 29455 ( 0 ) ; spanish , with 29125 ( 0 ) ; polish , with 21990 ( 0 ) ; arabic , with 20495 ( 0 ) ; dutch , with 19980 ( 0 ) ; and vietnamese , with 19350 ( 0 ) . the most common aboriginal language is cree 17215 ( 0 ) . other common mother tongues include italian with 13095 speakers ( 0 ) ; urdu with 11275 ( 0 ) ; and korean with 10845 ( 0 ) ; then hindi 8985 ( 0 ) ; farsi 7700 ( 0 ) ; portuguese 7205 ( 0 ) ; and hungarian 6770 ( 0 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta has considerable ethnic diversity . in line with the rest of canada , many are descended from immigrants of western european nations , notably england , scotland , ireland , wales and france , but large numbers later came from other regions of europe , notably germany , ukraine and scandinavia . according to statistics canada , alberta is home to the second - highest proportion ( 2 ) of francophones in western canada ( after manitoba ) . despite this , relatively few albertans claim french as their mother tongue . many of albertas french - speaking residents live in the central and northwestern regions of the province , after migration from other areas of canada or descending from métis . as reported in the 2001 census , the chinese represented nearly 4 of albertas population , and south asians represented more than 2 . both edmonton and calgary have historic chinatowns , and calgary has canadas third - largest chinese community . the chinese presence began with workers employed in the building of the canadian pacific railway in the 1880s . indigenous albertans makeup approximately 3 of the population . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 2006 canadian census , the most commonly reported ethnic origins among albertans were : 885825 english ( 27 ) ; 679705 german ( 20 ) ; 667405 canadian ( 20 ) ; 661265 scottish ( 20 ) ; 539160 irish ( 16 ) ; 388210 french ( 11 ) ; 332180 ukrainian ( 10 ) ; 172910 dutch ( 5 ) ; 170935 polish ( 5 ) ; 169355 north american indian ( 5 ) ; 144585 norwegian ( 4 ) ; and 137600 chinese ( 4 ) . ( each person could choose as many ethnicities as were applicable . amongst those of british heritage , the scots have had a particularly strong influence on place - names , with the names of many cities and towns including calgary , airdrie , canmore , and banff having scottish origins . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta is the third most diverse province in terms of visible minorities after british columbia and ontario with 13 of the population consisting of visible minorities in 2006 . over one - third of the populations of calgary and edmonton belong to a visible minority group . aboriginal identity peoples made up 5 of the population in 2006 , about half of whom consist of first nations and the other half are métis . there are also a small number of inuit people in alberta . the number of aboriginal identity peoples have been increasing at a rate greater than the population of alberta . the remainder belonged to a wide variety of different religious affiliations , none of which constituted more than 2 of the population . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break members of lds church are mostly concentrated in the extreme south of the province . alberta has a population of hutterites , a communal anabaptist sect similar to the mennonites , and has a significant population of seventh - day adventists . alberta is home to several byzantine rite churches as part of the legacy of eastern european immigration , including the ukrainian catholic eparchy of edmonton , and the ukrainian orthodox church of canadas western diocese which is based in edmonton . muslims made up 3 of the population , sikhs 1 , buddhists 1 , and hindus 1 . many of these are immigrants , but others have roots that go back to the first settlers of the prairies . canadas oldest mosque , the al - rashid mosque , is located in edmonton , whereas calgary is home to canadas largest mosque , the baitun nur mosque . alberta is also home to a growing jewish population of about 15400 people who constituted 0 of albertas population . most of albertas jews live in the metropolitan areas of calgary ( 8200 ) and edmonton ( 5500 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albertas economy was one of the strongest in the world , supported by the burgeoning petroleum industry and to a lesser extent , agriculture and technology . in 2013 , albertas per capita gdp exceeded that of the united states , norway , or switzerland , and was the highest of any province in canada at this was 56 higher than the national average of and more than twice that of some of the atlantic provinces . in 2006 , the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in canadian history . according to the 2006 census , the median annual family income after taxes was 70986 in alberta ( compared to 60270 in canada as a whole ) . in 2014 , alberta had the second - largest economy in canada after ontario , with a gdp exceeding . the gdp of the province calculated at basic prices rose by 4 in 2017 to 327billion , which was the largest increase recorded in canada , and it ended two consecutive years of decreases . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albertas debt - to - gdp ratio is projected to peak at 12 in fiscal year 2021–2022 , falling to 11 the following year . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the calgary - edmonton corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in canada . the region covers a distance of roughly north to south . in 2001 , the population of the calgary - edmonton corridor was 2million ( 72 of albertas population ) . it is also one of the fastest - growing regions in the country . a 2003 study by td bank financial group found the corridor to be the only canadian urban centre to amass a united states level of wealth while maintaining a canadian style quality of life , offering universal health care benefits . the study found that gdp per capita in the corridor was 10 above average united states metropolitan areas and 40 above other canadian cities at that time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the fraser institute states that alberta also has very high levels of economic freedom and rates alberta as the freest economy in canada , and second - freest economy amongst states and canadian provinces . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2014 , merchandise exports totalled us121billion . energy revenues totalled 111billion and energy resource exports totalled 90billion . farm cash receipts from agricultural products totalled 12billion . shipments of forest products totalled 5billion while exports were 2billion . manufacturing sales totalled 79billion , and albertas information and communications technology ( ict ) industries generated over 13billion in revenue . in total , albertas 2014 gdp amassed 364billion in 2007 dollars , or 414billion in 2015 dollars . in 2015 , albertas gdp grew unstably despite low oil prices , with growth rates as high 4 and as low as 0 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break agriculture has a significant position in the provinces economy . the province has over three million head of cattle , and alberta beef has a healthy worldwide market . nearly one half of all canadian beef is produced in alberta . alberta is one of the top producers of plains buffalo ( bison ) for the consumer market . sheep for wool and mutton are also raised . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break wheat and canola are primary farm crops , with alberta leading the provinces in spring wheat production ; other grains are also prominent . much of the farming is dryland farming , often with fallow seasons interspersed with cultivation . continuous cropping ( in which there is no fallow season ) is gradually becoming a more common mode of production because of increased profits and a reduction of soil erosion . across the province , the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing ; farmers typically truck the grain to central points . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta is the leading beekeeping province of canada , with some beekeepers wintering hives indoors in specially designed barns in southern alberta , then migrating north during the summer into the peace river valley where the season is short but the working days are long for honeybees to produce honey from clover and fireweed . hybrid canola also requires bee pollination , and some beekeepers service this need . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break forestry plays a vital role in albertas economy , providing over 15000 jobs and contributing billions of dollars annually . uses for harvested timber include pulpwood , hardwood , engineered wood and bioproducts such as chemicals and biofuels . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta is the largest producer of conventional crude oil , synthetic crude , natural gas and gas products in canada . alberta is the worlds second - largest exporter of natural gas and the fourth - largest producer . two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in north america are located in central and north - central alberta . in both red deer and edmonton , polyethylene and vinyl manufacturers produce products that are shipped all over the world . edmontons oil refineries provide the raw materials for a large petrochemical industry to the east of edmonton . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the athabasca oil sands surrounding fort mcmurray have estimated unconventional oil reserves approximately equal to the conventional oil reserves of the rest of the world , estimated to be 1trillion barrels ( 254km3 ) . many companies employ both conventional strip mining and non - conventional in situ methods to extract the bitumen from the oil sands . as of late 2006 , there were over 100billion in oil sands projects under construction or in the planning stages in northeastern alberta . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the oil sands is the price of oil . the oil price increases since 2003 have made it profitable to extract this oil , which in the past would give little profit or even a loss . by mid - 2014 , rising costs and stabilizing oil prices threatened the economic viability of some projects . an example of this was the shelving of the joslyn north project in the athabasca region in may 2014 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with concerted effort and support from the provincial government , several high - tech industries have found their birth in alberta , notably patents related to interactive liquid - crystal display systems with a growing economy , alberta has several financial institutions dealing with civil and private funds . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta has been a tourist destination from the early days of the 20th century , with attractions including outdoor locales for skiing , hiking , and camping , shopping locales such as west edmonton mall , calgary stampede , outdoor festivals , professional athletic events , international sporting competitions such as the commonwealth games and olympic games , as well as more eclectic attractions . according to alberta economic development , calgary and edmonton both host over four million visitors annually . banff , jasper and the rocky mountains are visited by about three million people per year . alberta tourism relies heavily on southern ontario tourists , as well as tourists from other parts of canada , the united states , and many other countries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are also natural attractions like elk island national park , wood buffalo national park , and the columbia icefield . albertas rockies include well - known tourist destinations banff national park and jasper national park . the two mountain parks are connected by the scenic icefields parkway . banff is located west of calgary on highway1 , and jasper is located west of edmonton on the yellowhead highway . five of canadas fourteen unesco world heritage sites are located within the province : canadian rocky mountain parks , waterton - glacier international peace park , wood buffalo national park , dinosaur provincial park and head - smashed - in buffalo jump . a number of these areas hold ski resorts , most notably banff sunshine , lake louise , marmot basin , norquay and nakiska . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break about 1million people visit the calgary stampede , a celebration of canadas own wild west and the cattle ranching industry . about 700000 people enjoy edmontons k - days ( formerly klondike days and capital ex ) . edmonton was the gateway to the only all - canadian route to the yukon gold fields , and the only route which did not require gold - seekers to travel the exhausting and dangerous chilkoot pass . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another tourist destination that draws more than 650000 visitors each year is the drumheller valley , located northeast of calgary . drumheller , " dinosaur capital of the world " , offers the royal tyrrell museum of palaeontology . drumheller also had a rich mining history being one of western canadas largest coal producers during the war years . another attraction in east - central alberta is alberta prairie railway excursions , a popular tourist attraction operated out of stettler , that offers train excursions into the prairie and caters to tens of thousands of visitors every year . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the government of alberta is organized as a parliamentary democracy with a unicameral legislature . its unicameral legislature—the legislative assembly—consists of 87 members elected first past the post ( fptp ) from single - member constituencies . locally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately . their boundaries do not necessarily coincide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as queen of canada , elizabeth ii is the head of state for the government of alberta . her duties in alberta are carried out by lieutenant governor salma lakhani . the queen and lieutenant governor are figureheads whose actions are highly restricted by custom and constitutional convention . the lieutenant governor handles numerous honorific duties in the name of the queen . the government is headed by the premier . the premier is normally a member of the legislative assembly , and draws all the members of the cabinet from among the members of the legislative assembly . the city of edmonton is the seat of the provincial government—the capital of alberta . the premier is jason kenney , sworn in on april30 , 2019 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albertas elections have tended to yield much more conservative outcomes than those of other canadian provinces . since the 1960s , alberta has had three main political parties , the progressive conservatives ( " conservatives " or " tories " ) , the liberals , and the social democratic new democrats . the wildrose party , a more libertarian party formed in early 2008 , gained much support in the 2012 election and became the official opposition , a role it held until 2017 when it was dissolved and succeeded by the new united conservative party created by the merger of wildrose and the progressive conservatives . the strongly conservative social credit party was a power in alberta for many decades , but fell from the political map after the progressive conservatives came to power in 1971 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for 44 years the progressive conservatives governed alberta . they lost the 2015 election to the ndp ( which formed their own government for the first time in provincial history , breaking almost 80 consecutive years of right - wing rule ) , suggesting at the time a possible shift to the left in the province , also indicated by the election of progressive mayors in both of albertas major cities . since becoming a province in 1905 , alberta has seen only five changes of government—only six parties have governed alberta : the liberals , from 1905 to 1921 ; the united farmers of alberta , from 1921 to 1935 ; the social credit party , from 1935 to 1971 ; the progressive conservative party , from 1971 to 2015 ; from 2015 to 2019 , the alberta new democratic party ; and from 2019 , the united conservative party , with the most recent transfer of power being the first time in provincial history that an incumbent government was not returned to a second term . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the province is divided into ten types of local governments – urban municipalities ( including cities , towns , villages and summer villages ) , specialized municipalities , rural municipalities ( including municipal districts ( often named as counties ) , improvement districts , and special areas ) , métis settlements , and indian reserves . all types of municipalities are governed by local residents and were incorporated under various provincial acts , with the exception of improvement districts ( governed by either the provincial or federal government ) , and indian reserves ( governed by local band governments under federal jurisdiction ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break policing in the province of alberta upon its creation was the responsibility of the royal northwest mounted police . in 1917 , due to pressures of the first world war , the alberta provincial police was created . this organization policed the province until it was disbanded as a great depression - era cost - cutting measure in 1932 . it was at that time the , now renamed , royal canadian mounted police resumed policing of the province , specifically rcmp " k " division . with the advent of the alberta sheriffs branch , the distribution of duties of law enforcement in alberta has been evolving as certain aspects , such as traffic enforcement , mobile surveillance and the close protection of the premier of alberta have been transferred to the sheriffs . in 2006 , alberta formed the alberta law enforcement response teams ( alert ) to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it . alert is made up of members of the rcmp , sheriffs branch , and various major municipal police forces in alberta . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break military bases in alberta include canadian forces base ( cfb ) cold lake , cfb edmonton , cfb suffield and cfb wainwright . air force units stationed at cfb cold lake have access to the cold lake air weapons range . cfb edmonton is the headquarters for the 3rd canadian division . cfb suffield hosts british troops and is the largest training facility in canada . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to albertas 2009 budget , government revenue in that year came mainly from royalties on non - renewable natural resources ( 30 ) , personal income taxes ( 22 ) , corporate and other taxes ( 19 ) , and grants from the federal government primarily for infrastructure projects ( 9 ) . in 2014 , alberta received 6billion in bitumen royalties . with the drop in the price of oil in 2015 it was down to 1billion . in 2016 , alberta received " about 837million in royalty payments from oil sands royalty projects " . according to the 2018–2021 fiscal plan , the two top sources of revenue in 2016 were personal income tax at 10763million and federal transfers of 7976million with total resource revenue at 3097million . alberta is the only province in canada without a provincial sales tax . alberta residents are subject to the federal sales tax , the goods and services tax of 5 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 2001 to 2016 , alberta was the only canadian province to have a flat tax of 10 of taxable income , which was introduced by premier , ralph klein , as part of the alberta tax advantage , which also included a zero - percent tax on income below a " generous personal exemption " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2016 , under premier rachel notley , while most albertans continued to pay the 10 income tax rate , new tax brackets 12 , 14 , and 15 for those with higher incomes ( 128145 annually or more ) were introduced . in addition to a variety of tax deductions for persons with disabilities , students , and the aged . albertas municipalities and school jurisdictions have their own governments who usually work in co - operation with the provincial government . by 2018 , most albertans continued to pay the 10 income tax rate . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to a march 2015 statistics canada report , the median household income in alberta in 2014 was about 100000 , which is 23 higher than the canadian national average . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break based on statistic canada reports , low - income albertans , who earn less than 25000 and those in the high - income bracket earning 150000 or more , are the lowest - taxed people in canada . pay more in provincial taxes than residents in british columbia and ontario . in terms of income tax , alberta is the " best province " for those with a low income because there is no provincial income tax for those who earn 18915 or less . even with the 2016 progressive tax brackets up to 15 , albertans who have the highest incomes , those with a 150000 annual income or more—about 178000 people in 2015 , pay the least in taxes in canada . — about 1million albertans earned between 25000 and 150000 in 2015 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta also privatized alcohol distribution . by 2010 , privatization had increased outlets from 304 stores to 1726 ; 1300 jobs to 4000 jobs ; and 3325 products to 16495 products . tax revenue also increased from 400million to 700million . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2017 / 18 alberta collected about 2billion in education property taxes from municipalities . alberta municipalities raise a significant portion of their income through levying property taxes . the value of assessed property in alberta was approximately 727billion in 2011 . most real property is assessed according to its market value . depending on the property type , property owners may appeal a property assessment to their municipal ' local assessment review board ' , ' composite assessment review board , ' or the alberta municipal government board . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break summer brings many festivals to the province of alberta , especially in edmonton . the edmonton fringe festival is the worlds second - largest after the edinburgh festival . both calgary and edmonton host many annual festivals and events , including folk music festivals . the citys " heritage days " festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups . edmontons churchill square is home to a large number of the festivals , including the large taste of edmonton and the works art design festival throughout the summer months . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the city of calgary is also famous for its stampede , dubbed " the greatest outdoor show on earth " . the stampede is canadas biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions , such as calf roping and bull riding . in line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique alberta western heritage crafts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 2019 , the then minister of culture and tourism ricardo miranda announced the alberta artist in residence program in conjunction with the provinces first month of the artist to celebrate the arts and the value they bring to the province , both socially and economically , the artist is selected each year via a public and competitive process is expected to do community outreach and attend events to promote the arts throughout the province . the award comes with 60000 funding which includes travel and materials costs . on january 31 , 2019 , lauren crazybull named albertas 1st artist in residence . alberta is the first province to launch an artist in residence program in canada . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as with any canadian province , the alberta legislature has ( almost ) exclusive authority to make laws respecting education . since 1905 , the legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905 , as well as to create and regulate universities , colleges , technical institutions , and other educational forms and institutions ( public charter schools , private schools , homeschooling ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are forty - two public school jurisdictions in alberta , and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions . sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a catholic electorate , and one ( st . lbert ) has a protestant electorate . in addition , one protestant separate school district , glen avon , survives as a ward of the st . paul education region . the city of lloydminster straddles the albertan / saskatchewan border , and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers : both of them operate according to saskatchewan law . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing k–12 education . prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as supplementary support for local education . in 1994 , the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards , but not for separate school boards . since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of k–12 education ; the difference is that the provincial government now sets the mill rate , the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government . the relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to support k–12 education provided by school boards . the provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them , according to a formula , to public and separate school jurisdictions and francophone authorities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break public and separate school boards , charter schools , and private schools all follow the program of studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education ( alberta education ) . homeschool tutors may choose to follow the program of studies or develop their own program of studies . public and separate schools , charter schools , and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by alberta education , they administer provincial achievement tests and diploma examinations set by alberta education , and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by alberta education . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the university of alberta , located in edmonton and established in 1908 , is albertas oldest and largest university . the university of calgary , once affiliated with the university of alberta , gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second - largest university in alberta . athabasca university , which focuses on distance learning , and the university of lethbridge are located in athabasca and lethbridge respectively . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in early september 2009 , mount royal university became calgarys second public university , and in late september 2009 , a similar move made macewan university edmontons second public university . there are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding , along with two technical institutes , northern alberta institute of technology and southern alberta institute of technology . two of the colleges , red deer college and grande prairie regional college , were approved by the alberta government to become degree - granting universities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are also many private post - secondary institutions , mostly christian universities , bringing the total number of universities to 12 . students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions . there was some controversy in 2005 over the rising cost of post - secondary education for students ( as opposed to taxpayers ) . in 2005 , premier ralph klein made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta provides a publicly funded , fully integrated health system , through alberta health services ( ahs ) —a quasi - independent agency that delivers health care on behalf of the government of albertas ministry of health . the alberta government provides health services for all its residents as set out by the provisions of the canada health act of 1984 . alberta became canadas second province ( after saskatchewan ) to adopt a tommy douglas - style program in 1950 , a precursor to the modern medicare system . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albertas health care budget was 22billion during the 2018–2019 fiscal year ( approximately 45 of all government spending ) , making it the best - funded health - care system per - capita in canada . every hour the province spends more than 2million , ( or 60million per day ) , to maintain and improve health care in the province . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break notable health , education , research , and resources facilities in alberta , all of which are located within calgary or edmonton . health centres in calgary include : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break health centres in edmonton include : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the edmonton clinic complex , completed in 2012 , provides a similar research , education , and care environment as the mayo clinic in the united states . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break all public health care services funded by the government of alberta are delivered operationally by alberta health services . ahs is the provinces single health authority , established on july 1 , 2008 , which replaced nine regional health authorities . ahs also funds all ground ambulance services in the province , as well as the province - wide shock trauma air rescue service ( stars ) air ambulance service . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta is well - connected by air , with international airports in both calgary and edmonton . calgary international airport and edmonton international airport are the fourth - and fifth - busiest in canada , respectively . calgarys airport is a hub for westjet airlines and a regional hub for air canada , primarily serving the prairie provinces ( alberta , saskatchewan and manitoba ) for connecting flights to british columbia , eastern canada , fifteen major united states centres , nine european airports , one asian airport and four destinations in mexico and the caribbean . edmontons airport acts as a hub for the canadian north and has connections to all major canadian airports as well as airports in the united states , europe , mexico , and the caribbean . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break calgary , edmonton , red deer , medicine hat , and lethbridge have substantial public transit systems in addition to buses , calgary and edmonton operate light rail transit ( lrt ) systems edmonton lrt , which is underground in the downtown core and on the surface outside the cbd , was the first of the modern generation of light rail systems to be built in north america , while the calgary c train has one of the highest numbers of daily riders of any lrt system in north america . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are more than of operating mainline railway in alberta . the vast majority of this trackage is owned by the canadian pacific railway ( cp ) and canadian national railway ( cn ) companies , which operate freight transport across the province . additional railfreight service in the province is provided by two shortline railways : the battle river railway and forty mile rail . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break passenger trains include via rails canadian ( toronto–vancouver ) and jasper–prince rupert trains , which use the cn mainline and pass through jasper national park and parallel the yellowhead highway during at least part of their routes . the rocky mountaineer operates two sections : one from vancouver to banff over cp tracks , and a section that travels over cn tracks to jasper . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta has over of highways and roads , of which nearly are paved . the main north–south corridor is highway 2 , which begins south of cardston at the carway border crossing and is part of the canamex corridor . beginning at the coutts border crossing and ending at lethbridge , highway4 , effectively extends interstate 15 into alberta and is the busiest united states gateway to the province . highway3 joins lethbridge to fort macleod and links highway2 to highway4 . highway2 travels north through fort macleod , calgary , red deer , and edmonton . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break north of edmonton , the highway continues to athabasca , then northwesterly along the south shore of lesser slave lake into high prairie , north to peace river , west to fairview and finally south to grande prairie , where it ends at an interchange with highway43 . highway2 is supplemented by two more highways that run parallel to it : highway 22 , west of highway2 , known as cowboy trail , and highway21 , east of highway2 . highway43 travels northwest into grande prairie and the peace river country . travelling northeast from edmonton , the highway 63 connects to fort mcmurrayand the athabasca oil sands . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta has two main east–west corridors . the southern corridor , part of the trans - canada highway system , enters the province near medicine hat , runs westward through calgary , and leaves alberta through banff national park . the northern corridor , also part of the trans - canada network and known as the yellowhead highway ( highway16 ) , runs west from lloydminster in eastern alberta , through edmonton and jasper national park into british columbia . one of the most scenic drives is along the icefields parkway , which runs for between jasper and lake louise , with mountain ranges and glaciers on either side of its entire length . a third corridor stretches across southern alberta ; highway3 runs between crowsnest pass and medicine hat through lethbridge and forms the eastern portion of the crowsnest highway . another major corridor through central alberta is highway11 ( also known as the david thompson highway ) , which runs east from the saskatchewan river crossing in banff national park through rocky mountain house and red deer , connecting with highway12 , west of stettler . the highway connects many of the smaller towns in central alberta with calgary and edmonton , as it crosses highway2 just west of red deer . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break urban stretches of albertas major highways and freeways are often called trails . for example , highway2 , the main north–south highway in the province , is called deerfoot trail as it passes through calgary but becomes calgary trail ( southbound ) and gateway boulevard ( northbound ) as it enters edmonton and then turns into st . albert trail as it leaves edmonton for the city of st . albert . calgary , in particular , has a tradition of calling its largest urban expressways trails and naming many of them after prominent first nations individuals and tribes , such as crowchild trail , deerfoot trail , and stoney trail . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alberta has relationships with many provinces , states , and other entities worldwide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

*********** Article 91: Actinopterygii ***********

actinopterygii ( ; having raysgrc ) , members of which are known as ray - finned fishes , is a clade ( traditionally class or subclass ) of the bony fishes . they comprise over 50 of living vertebrate species . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ray - finned fishes are so - called because their fins are webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines ( rays ) , as opposed to the fleshy , lobed fins that characterize the class sarcopterygii ( lobe - finned fish ) . these actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements , the radials , which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton ( for example , pelvic and pectoral girdles ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by species count , actinopterygians dominate the vertebrates , and they comprise nearly 99 of the over 30000 species of fish . they are ubiquitous throughout freshwater and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams extant species can range in size from paedocypris , at , to the massive ocean sunfish , at , and the long - bodied oarfish , at . the vast majority of actinopterygii ( 95 ) are teleosts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a : dorsal fin , b : fin rays , c : lateral line , d : kidney , e : swim bladder , f : weberian apparatus , g : inner ear , h : brain , i : nostrils , l : eye , m : gills , n : heart , o : stomach , p : gall bladder , q : spleen , r : internal sex organs ( ovaries or testes ) , s : ventral fins , t : spine , u : anal fin , v : tail ( caudal fin ) . possible other parts not shown : barbels , adipose fin , external genitalia ( gonopodium ) uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ray - finned fishes occur in many variant forms the main features of a typical ray - finned fish are shown in the adjacent diagram . the swim bladder is the more derived structure . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ray - finned fishes have many different types of scales ; but all teleosts , the most advanced actinopterygians , have leptoid scales . the outer part of these scales fan out with bony ridges while the inner part is crossed with fibrous connective tissue . leptoid scales are thinner and more transparent than other types of scales , and lack the hardened enamel or dentine - like layers found in the scales of many other fish . unlike ganoid scales , which are found in non - teleost actinopterygians , new scales are added in concentric layers as the fish grows . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ray - finned and lobe - finned fishes , including tetrapods , possessed lungs used for aerial respiration . only bichirs retain ventrally budding lungs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ray - finned fish vary in size and shape , in their feeding specializations , and in the number and arrangement of their ray - fins . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in nearly all ray - finned fish , the sexes are separate , and in most species the females spawn eggs that are fertilized externally , typically with the male inseminating the eggs after they are laid . development then proceeds with a free - swimming larval stage . however other patterns of ontogeny exist , with one of the commonest being sequential hermaphroditism . in most cases this involves protogyny , fish starting life as females and converting to males at some stage , triggered by some internal or external factor . protandry , where a fish converts from male to female , is much less common than protogyny . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most families use external rather than internal fertilization . of the oviparous teleosts , most ( 79 ) do not provide parental care . viviparity , ovoviviparity , or some form of parental care for eggs , whether by the male , the female , or both parents is seen in a significant fraction ( 21 ) of the 422 teleost families ; no care is likely the ancestral condition . viviparity is relatively rare and is found in about 6 of living teleost species ; male care is far more common than female care . male territoriality " preadapts " a species for evolving male parental care . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are a few examples of fish that self - fertilise . the mangrove rivulus is an amphibious , simultaneous hermaphrodite , producing both eggs and spawn and having internal fertilisation . this mode of reproduction may be related to the fishs habit of spending long periods out of water in the mangrove forests it inhabits . males are occasionally produced at temperatures below 19 °c and can fertilise eggs that are then spawned by the female . this maintains genetic variability in a species that is otherwise highly inbred . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break actinopterygii is divided into the classes cladistia and actinopteri . the latter comprises the subclasses chondrostei and neopterygii . the neopterygii , in turn , is divided into the infraclasses holostei and teleostei . during the mesozoic ( triassic , jurassic , cretaceous ) and cenozoic the teleosts in particular diversified widely . as a result , 96 of living fish species are teleosts ( 40 of all fish species belong to the teleost subgroup acanthomorpha ) , while all other groups of actinopterygians represent depauperate lineages . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the classification of ray - finned fishes can be summarized as follows : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the cladogram below shows the main clades of living actinopterygians and their evolutionary relationships to other extant groups of fishes and the four - limbed vertebrates ( tetrapods ) . the latter include mostly terrestrial species but also groups that became secondarily aquatic ( for example whales and dolphins ) . tetrapods evolved from a group of bony fish during the devonian period . approximate divergence dates for the different actinopterygian clades ( in millions of years , mya ) are from near and others , 2012 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the polypterids ( bichirs and reedfish ) are the sister lineage of all other actinopterygians , the acipenseriformes ( sturgeons and paddlefishes ) are the sister lineage of neopterygii , and holostei ( bowfin and gars ) are the sister lineage of teleosts . the elopomorpha ( eels and tarpons ) appear to be the most basal teleosts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earliest known fossil actinopterygian is andreolepis hedei , dating back 420million years ( late silurian ) . remains have been found in russia , sweden , and estonia . the earliest fossil relatives of modern teleosts are from the triassic period ( prohalecites , pholidophorus ) , although it is suspected that teleosts originated already during the paleozoic era . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the listing below is a summary of all extinct ( indicated by a dagger , † ) and living groups of actinopterygii with their respcective taxonomic rank . the taxonomy follows phylogenetic classification of bony fishes with notes when this differs from nelson , and fishbase and extinct groups from van der laan 2016 and xu 2021 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 92: Albert Einstein ***********

albert einstein ( ; ; 14 march 1879– 18 april 1955 ) was a german - born theoretical physicist , widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time . einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity , but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics . relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics . his mass–energy equivalence formula , which arises from relativity theory , has been dubbed " the worlds most famous equation " . his work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science . he received the 1921 nobel prize in physics " for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect " , a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory . his intellectual achievements and originality resulted in " einstein " becoming synonymous with " genius " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1905 , a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ( ' miracle year ' ) , einstein published four groundbreaking papers . these outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect , explained brownian motion , introduced special relativity , and demonstrated mass - energy equivalence . einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field , which led him to develop his special theory of relativity . he then extended the theory to gravitational fields ; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 , introducing his theory of gravitation . in 1917 , he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe . he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory , which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules . he also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of radiation , which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break however , for much of the later part of his career , he worked on two ultimately unsuccessful endeavors . first , despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics , he opposed what it evolved into , objecting that nature " does not play dice " . second , he attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism . as a result , he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein was born in the german empire , but moved to switzerland in 1895 , forsaking his german citizenship ( as a subject of the kingdom of württemberg ) the following year . in 1897 , at the age of 17 , he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the swiss federal polytechnic school in zürich , graduating in 1900 . in 1901 , he acquired swiss citizenship , which he kept for the rest of his life , and in 1903 he secured a permanent position at the swiss patent office in bern . in 1905 , he was awarded a phd by the university of zurich . in 1914 , einstein moved to berlin in order to join the prussian academy of sciences and the humboldt university of berlin . in 1917 , einstein became director of the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics ; he also became a german citizen again , this time prussian . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1933 , while einstein was visiting the united states , adolf hitler came to power in germany . einstein , of jewish origin , objected to the policies of the newly elected nazi government ; he settled in the united states and became an american citizen in 1940 . on the eve of world war ii , he endorsed a letter to president franklin roosevelt alerting him to the potential german nuclear weapons program and recommending that the us begin similar research . einstein supported the allies but generally denounced the idea of nuclear weapons . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albert einstein was born in ulm , his parents were hermann einstein , a salesman and engineer , and pauline koch . in 1880 , the family moved to munich , where einsteins father and his uncle jakob founded elektrotechnische fabrik einstein cie , a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albert attended a catholic elementary school in munich , from the age of five , for three years . at the age of eight , he was transferred to the luitpold - gymnasium ( now known as the albert - einstein - gymnasium ) , where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the german empire seven years later . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1894 , hermann and jakobs company lost a bid to supply the city of munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current ( dc ) standard to the more efficient alternating current ( ac ) standard . the loss forced the sale of the munich factory . in search of business , the einstein family moved to italy , first to milan and a few months later to pavia . when the family moved to pavia , einstein , then 15 , stayed in munich to finish his studies at the luitpold gymnasium . his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering , but einstein clashed with the authorities and resented the schools regimen and teaching method . he later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning . at the end of december 1894 , he traveled to italy to join his family in pavia , convincing the school to let him go by using a doctors note . during his time in italy he wrote a short essay with the title " on the investigation of the state of the ether in a magnetic field " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein excelled at math and physics from a young age , reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers . the 12 - year - old einstein taught himself algebra and euclidean geometry over a single summer . einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the pythagorean theorem at age 12 . a family tutor max talmud says that after he had given the 12 - year - old einstein a geometry textbook , after a short time " einstein had worked through the whole book . he thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high i could not follow . " his passion for geometry and algebra led the 12 - year - old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a " mathematical structure " . einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12 , and as a 14 - year - old he says he had " mastered integral and differential calculus " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break at age 13 , when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy ( and music ) , einstein was introduced to kants critique of pure reason . kant became his favorite philosopher , his tutor stating : " at the time he was still a child , only thirteen years old , yet kants works , incomprehensible to ordinary mortals , seemed to be clear to him . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1895 , at the age of 16 , einstein took the entrance examinations for the swiss federal polytechnic school in zürich ( later the eidgenössische technische hochschule , eth ) . he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination , but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics . on the advice of the principal of the polytechnic school , he attended the argovian cantonal school ( gymnasium ) in aarau , switzerland , in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling . while lodging with the family of jost winteler , he fell in love with wintelers daughter , marie . alberts sister maja later married wintelers son paul . in january 1896 , with his fathers approval , einstein renounced his citizenship in the german kingdom of württemberg to avoid military service . in september 1896 he passed the swiss matura with mostly good grades , including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects , on a scale of 1–6 . at 17 , he enrolled in the four - year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the federal polytechnic school . marie winteler , who was a year older , moved to olsberg , switzerland , for a teaching post . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einsteins future wife , a 20 - year - old serbian named mileva marić , also enrolled at the polytechnic school that year . she was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course . over the next few years , einsteins and marić ' s friendship developed into a romance , and they spent countless hours debating and reading books together on extra - curricular physics in which they were both interested . einstein wrote in his letters to marić that he preferred studying alongside her . in 1900 , einstein passed the exams in maths and physics and was awarded a federal teaching diploma . there is eyewitness evidence and several letters over many years that indicate marić might have collaborated with einstein prior to his landmark 1905 papers , known as the annus mirabilis papers , and that they developed some of the concepts together during their studies , although some historians of physics who have studied the issue disagree that she made any substantive contributions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break early correspondence between einstein and marić was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named " lieserl " , born in early 1902 in novi sad where marić was staying with her parents . marić returned to switzerland without the child , whose real name and fate are unknown . the contents of einsteins letter in september 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein and marić married in january 1903 . in may 1904 , their son hans albert einstein was born in bern , switzerland . their son eduard was born in zürich in july 1910 . the couple moved to berlin in april 1914 , but marić returned to zürich with their sons after learning that , despite their close relationship before , as part of the divorce settlement , einstein agreed to give marić his future ( in the event , 1921 ) nobel prize money . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in letters revealed in 2015 , einstein wrote to his early love marie winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her . he wrote in 1910 , while his wife was pregnant with their second child : " i think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be . " he spoke about a " misguided love " and a " missed life " regarding his love for marie . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein married löwenthal in 1919 , after having had a relationship with her since 1912 . they emigrated to the united states in 1933 . elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in december 1936 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1923 , einstein fell in love with a secretary named betty neumann , the niece of a close friend , hans mühsam . in a volume of letters released by hebrew university of jerusalem in 2006 , einstein described about six women , including margarete lebach ( a blonde austrian ) , estella katzenellenbogen ( the rich owner of a florist business ) , toni mendel ( a wealthy jewish widow ) and ethel michanowski ( a berlin socialite ) , with whom he spent time and from whom he received gifts while being married to elsa . later , after the death of his second wife elsa , einstein was briefly in a relationship with margarita konenkova . konenkova was a russian spy who was married to the noted russian sculptor sergei konenkov ( who created the bronze bust of einstein at the institute for advanced study at princeton ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einsteins son eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia . his mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods , finally , after her death , being committed permanently to burghölzli , the psychiatric university hospital in zürich . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after graduating in 1900 , einstein spent almost two years searching for a teaching post . he acquired swiss citizenship in february 1901 , but was not conscripted for medical reasons . with the help of marcel grossmanns father , he secured a job in bern at the swiss patent office , as an assistant examiner – level iii . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter . in 1903 , his position at the swiss patent office became permanent , although he was passed over for promotion until he " fully mastered machine technology " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical - mechanical synchronization of time , two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with a few friends he had met in bern , einstein started a small discussion group in 1902 , self - mockingly named " the olympia academy " , which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy . sometimes they were joined by mileva who attentively listened but did not participate . their readings included the works of henri poincaré , ernst mach , and david hume , which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1900 einsteins paper " folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen " ( " conclusions from the capillarity phenomena " ) was published in the journal annalen der physik . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break also in 1905 , which has been called einsteins annus mirabilis ( amazing year ) , he published four groundbreaking papers , on the photoelectric effect , brownian motion , special relativity , and the equivalence of mass and energy , which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world , at the age of 26 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by 1908 , he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the university of bern . the following year , after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the university of zurich , alfred kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics . einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein became a full professor at the german charles - ferdinand university in prague in april 1911 , accepting austrian citizenship in the austro - hungarian empire to do so . during his prague stay , he wrote 11 scientific works , five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in july 1912 , he returned to his alma mater in zürich . from 1912 until 1914 , he was a professor of theoretical physics at the eth zurich , where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics . he also studied continuum mechanics , the molecular theory of heat , and the problem of gravitation , on which he worked with mathematician and friend marcel grossmann . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when the " manifesto of the ninety - three " was published in october 1914—a document signed by a host of prominent german intellectuals that justified germanys militarism and position during the first world war—einstein was one of the few german intellectuals to rebut its contents and sign the pacifistic " manifesto to the europeans " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the spring of 1913 , einstein was enticed to move to berlin with an offer that included membership in the prussian academy of sciences , and a linked university of berlin professorship , enabling him to concentrate exclusively on research . after moving into his dahlem apartment on 1 april 1914 . as world war i broke out that year , the plan for kaiser wilhelm institute for physics was delayed . the institute was established on 1 october 1917 , with einstein as its director . in 1916 , einstein was elected president of the german physical society ( 1916–1918 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1911 , einstein used his 1907 equivalence principle to calculate the deflection of light from another star by the suns gravity . in 1913 , einstein improved upon those calculations by using riemannian space - time to represent the gravity field . by the fall of 1915 , einstein had successfully completed his general theory of relativity , which he used to calculate that deflection , and the perihelion precession of mercury . in 1919 , that deflection prediction was confirmed by sir arthur eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 may 1919 . those observations were published in the international media , making einstein world - famous . on 7 november 1919 , the leading british newspaper the times printed a banner headline that read : " revolution in science– new theory of the universe– newtonian ideas overthrown " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1920 , he became a foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences . in 1922 , he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics " for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect " . while the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial , the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an explanation but merely as a discovery of the law , as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the planck spectrum by bose . einstein was elected a foreign member of the royal society ( formemrs ) in 1921 . he also received the copley medal from the royal society in 1925 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein resigned from the prussian academy in march 1933 . einsteins scientific accomplishments while in berlin , included finishing the general theory of relativity , proving the gyromagnetic effect , contributing to the quantum theory of radiation , and bose–einstein statistics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein visited new york city for the first time on 2 april 1921 , where he received an official welcome by mayor john francis hylan , followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions . he went on to deliver several lectures at columbia university and princeton university , and in washington , he accompanied representatives of the national academy of sciences on a visit to the white house . on his return to europe he was the guest of the british statesman and philosopher viscount haldane in london , where he met several renowned scientific , intellectual , and political figures , and delivered a lecture at kings college london . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he also published an essay , " my first impression of the " , in july 1921 , in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of americans , much as had alexis de tocqueville , who published his own impressions in democracy in america ( 1835 ) . for some of his observations , einstein was clearly surprised : " what strikes a visitor is the joyous , positive attitude to life the american is friendly , self - confident , optimistic , and without envy . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1922 , his travels took him to asia and later to palestine , as part of a six - month excursion and speaking tour , as he visited singapore , ceylon and japan , where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of japanese . after his first public lecture , he met the emperor and empress at the imperial palace , where thousands came to watch . in a letter to his sons , he described his impression of the japanese as being modest , intelligent , considerate , and having a true feel for art . in his own travel diaries from his 1922–23 visit to asia , he expresses some views on the chinese , japanese and indian people , which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in 2018 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break because of einsteins travels to the far east , he was unable to personally accept the nobel prize for physics at the stockholm award ceremony in december 1922 . in his place , the banquet speech was made by a german diplomat , who praised einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on his return voyage , he visited palestine for 12 days , his only visit to that region . he was greeted as if he were a head of state , rather than a physicist , which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the british high commissioner , sir herbert samuel . during one reception , the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him . in einsteins talk to the audience , he expressed happiness that the jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein visited spain for two weeks in 1923 , where he briefly met santiago ramón y cajal and also received a diploma from king alfonso xiii naming him a member of the spanish academy of sciences . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from 1922 to 1932 , einstein was a member of the international committee on intellectual cooperation of the league of nations in geneva ( with a few months of interruption in 1923–1924 ) , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the months of march and april 1925 , einstein visited south america , where he spent about a month in argentina , a week in uruguay , and a week in rio de janeiro , brazil . einsteins visit was initiated by jorge duclout ( 1856–1927 ) and mauricio nirenstein ( 1877–1935 ) with the support of several argentine scholars , including julio rey pastor , jakob laub , and leopoldo lugones . the visit by einstein and his wife was financed primarily by the council of the university of buenos aires and the asociación hebraica argentina ( argentine hebraic association ) with a smaller contribution from the argentine - germanic cultural institution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in december 1930 , einstein visited america for the second time , originally intended as a two - month working visit as a research fellow at the california institute of technology . after the national attention , he received during his first trip to the us , he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy . although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly , he declined them all . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after arriving in new york city , einstein was taken to various places and events , including chinatown , a lunch with the editors of the new york times , and a performance of carmen at the metropolitan opera , where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival . during the days following , he was given the keys to the city by mayor jimmy walker and met the president of columbia university , who described einstein as " the ruling monarch of the mind " . harry emerson fosdick , pastor at new yorks riverside church , gave einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full - size statue that the church made of einstein , standing at the entrance . also during his stay in new york , he joined a crowd of 15000 people at madison square garden during a hanukkah celebration . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein next traveled to california , where he met caltech president and nobel laureate robert millikan . his friendship with millikan was " awkward " , as millikan " had a penchant for patriotic militarism " , where einstein was a pronounced pacifist . during an address to caltechs students , einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this aversion to war also led einstein to befriend author upton sinclair and film star charlie chaplin , both noted for their pacifism . carl laemmle , head of universal studios , gave einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to chaplin . they had an instant rapport , with chaplin inviting einstein and his wife , elsa , to his home for dinner . chaplin said einsteins outward persona , calm and gentle , seemed to conceal a " highly emotional temperament " , from which came his " extraordinary intellectual energy " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break chaplins film , city lights , was to premiere a few days later in hollywood , and chaplin invited einstein and elsa to join him as his special guests . walter isaacson , einsteins biographer , described this as " one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity " . chaplin visited einstein at his home on a later trip to berlin and recalled his " modest little flat " and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory . chaplin speculated that it was " possibly used as kindling wood by the nazis " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in february 1933 , while on a visit to the united states , einstein knew he could not return to germany with the rise to power of the nazis under germanys new chancellor , adolf hitler . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while at american universities in early 1933 , he undertook his third two - month visiting professorship at the california institute of technology in pasadena . in february and march 1933 , the gestapo repeatedly raided his familys apartment in berlin . he and his wife elsa returned to europe in march , and during the trip , they learned that the german reichstag had passed the enabling act on 23 march , transforming hitlers government into a de facto legal dictatorship , and that they would not be able to proceed to berlin . later on , they heard that their cottage had been raided by the nazis and einsteins personal sailboat confiscated . upon landing in antwerp , belgium on 28 march , einstein immediately went to the german consulate and surrendered his passport , formally renouncing his german citizenship . the nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a hitler youth camp . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in april 1933 , einstein discovered that the new german government had passed laws barring jews from holding any official positions , including teaching at universities . historian gerald holton describes how , with " virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues " , thousands of jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a month later , einsteins works were among those targeted by the german student union in the nazi book burnings , with nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaiming , " jewish intellectualism is dead . " one german magazine included him in a list of enemies of the german regime with the phrase , " not yet hanged " , offering a 5000 bounty on his head . in a subsequent letter to physicist and friend max born , who had already emigrated from germany to england , einstein wrote , " i must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise . " after moving to the us , he described the book burnings as a " spontaneous emotional outburst " by those who " shun popular enlightenment " , and " more than anything else in the world , fear the influence of men of intellectual independence " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein was now without a permanent home , unsure where he would live and work , and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in germany . he rented a house in de haan , belgium , where he lived for a few months . in late july 1933 , he went to england for about six weeks at the personal invitation of british naval officer commander oliver locker - lampson , who had become friends with einstein in the preceding years . locker - lampson invited him to stay near his home in a wooden cabin on roughton heath in the parish of . to protect einstein , locker - lampson had two bodyguards watch over him at his secluded cabin ; a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding einstein was published in the daily herald on 24 july 1933 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break locker - lampson took einstein to meet winston churchill at his home , and later , austen chamberlain and former prime minister lloyd george . einstein asked them to help bring jewish scientists out of germany . british historian martin gilbert notes that churchill responded immediately , and sent his friend , physicist frederick lindemann , to germany to seek out jewish scientists and place them in british universities . churchill later observed that as a result of germany having driven the jews out , they had lowered their " technical standards " and put the allies ' technology ahead of theirs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein later contacted leaders of other nations , including turkeys prime minister , i̇smet i̇nönü , to whom he wrote in september 1933 requesting placement of unemployed german - jewish scientists . as a result of einsteins letter , jewish invitees to turkey eventually totaled over " 1000 saved individuals " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break locker - lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend british citizenship to einstein , during which period einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in europe . in one of his speeches he denounced germanys treatment of jews , while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting jewish citizenship in palestine , as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere . in his speech he described einstein as a " citizen of the world " who should be offered a temporary shelter in the uk . both bills failed , however , and einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the institute for advanced study , in princeton , new jersey , us , to become a resident scholar . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in october 1933 , einstein returned to the us and took up a position at the institute for advanced study , noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing nazi germany . at the time , most american universities , including harvard , princeton and yale , had minimal or no jewish faculty or students , as a result of their jewish quotas , which lasted until the late 1940s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein was still undecided on his future . he had offers from several european universities , including christ church , oxford , where he stayed for three short periods between may 1931 and june 1933 and was offered a five - year studentship , but in 1935 , he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the united states and apply for citizenship . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einsteins affiliation with the institute for advanced study would last until his death in 1955 . at the new institute , where he soon developed a close friendship with gödel . the two would take long walks together discussing their work . bruria kaufman , his assistant , later became a physicist . during this period , einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics , both unsuccessfully . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1939 , a group of hungarian scientists that included émigré physicist leó szilárd attempted to alert washington to ongoing nazi atomic bomb research . the groups warnings were discounted . einstein and szilárd , along with other refugees such as edward teller and eugene wigner , " regarded it as their responsibility to alert americans to the possibility that german scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb , and to warn that hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon . " to make certain the us was aware of the danger , in july 1939 , a few months before the beginning of world war ii in europe , szilárd and wigner visited einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs , which einstein , a pacifist , said he had never considered . he was asked to lend his support by writing a letter , with szilárd , to president roosevelt , recommending the us pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the letter is believed to be " arguably the key stimulus for the adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the entry into world war ii " . in addition to the letter , einstein used his connections with the belgian royal family and the belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the white houses oval office . some say that as a result of einsteins letter and his meetings with roosevelt , the us entered the " race " to develop the bomb , drawing on its " immense material , financial , and scientific resources " to initiate the manhattan project . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break for einstein , " war was a disease and he called for resistance to war . " by signing the letter to roosevelt , some argue he went against his pacifist principles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein became an american citizen in 1940 . not long after settling into his career at the institute for advanced study in princeton , new jersey , he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in american culture when compared to europe . he recognized the " right of individuals to say and think what they pleased " , without social barriers , and as a result , individuals were encouraged , he said , to be more creative , a trait he valued from his own early education . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein joined the national association for the advancement of colored people ( naacp ) in princeton , where he campaigned for the civil rights of african americans . he considered racism americas " worst disease " , seeing it as " handed down from one generation to the next " . as part of his involvement , he corresponded with civil rights activist du bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951 . when einstein offered to be a character witness for du bois , the judge decided to drop the case . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1946 , einstein visited lincoln university in pennsylvania , a historically black college , where he was awarded an honorary degree . lincoln was the first university in the united states to grant college degrees to african americans ; alumni include langston hughes and thurgood marshall . einstein gave a speech about racism in america , adding , " i do not intend to be quiet about it . " a resident of princeton recalls that einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student . einstein has said " being a jew myself , perhaps i can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break " ladies ( coughs ) and gentlemen , our age is proud of the progress it has made in mans intellectual development . the search and striving for truth and knowledge is one of the highest of mans qualities " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the hebrew university of jerusalem , which opened in 1925 and was among its first board of governors . earlier , in 1921 , he was asked by the biochemist and president of the world zionist organization , chaim weizmann , to help raise funds for the planned university . he also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs uvmr_ev_paragraph_break among those , he advised first creating an institute of agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land . that should be followed , he suggested , by a chemical institute and an institute of microbiology , to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria , which he called an " evil " that was undermining a third of the countrys development . establishing an oriental studies institute , to include language courses given in both hebrew and arabic , for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments , was also important . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein was not a nationalist ; he was against the creation of an independent jewish state , which would be established without his help as israel in 1948 . einstein felt that the waves of arriving jews of the aliyah could live alongside existing arabs in palestine . his views were not shared by the majority of jews seeking to form a new country ; as a result , einstein was limited to a marginal role in the zionist movement . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break chaim weizmann later became israels first president . upon his death while in office in november 1952 and at the urging of ezriel carlebach , prime minister david ben - gurion offered einstein the position of president of israel , a mostly ceremonial post . the offer was presented by israels ambassador in washington , abba eban , who explained that the offer " embodies the deepest respect which the jewish people can repose in any of its sons " . einstein declined , and wrote in his response that he was " deeply moved " , and " at once saddened and ashamed " that he could not accept it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age . in his late journals he wrote : " if i were not a physicist , i would probably be a musician . i often think in music . i live my daydreams in music . i see my life in terms of music i get most joy in life out of music . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break his mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin , not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into german culture . according to conductor leon botstein , einstein began playing when he was 5 . however , he did not enjoy it at that age . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when he turned 13 , he discovered the violin sonatas of mozart , whereupon he became enamored of mozarts compositions and studied music more willingly . einstein taught himself to play without " ever practicing systematically " . he said that " love is a better teacher than a sense of duty . " at age 17 , he was heard by a school examiner in aarau while playing beethovens violin sonatas . the examiner stated afterward that his playing was " remarkable and revealing of ' great insight . what struck the examiner , writes botstein , was that einstein " displayed a deep love of the music , a quality that was and remains in short supply . music possessed an unusual meaning for this student . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break music took on a pivotal and permanent role in einsteins life from that period on . although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time , among those with whom einstein played chamber music were a few professionals , including kurt appelbaum , and he performed for private audiences and friends . chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in bern , zürich , and berlin , where he played with max planck and his son , among others . he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the köchel catalog of mozarts work ; that edition was prepared by alfred einstein , who may have been a distant relation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1931 , while engaged in research at the california institute of technology , he visited the zoellner family conservatory in los angeles , where he played some of beethoven and mozarts works with members of the zoellner quartet . near the end of his life , when the young juilliard quartet visited him in princeton , he played his violin with them , and the quartet was " impressed by einsteins level of coordination and intonation " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1918 , einstein was one of the founding members of the german democratic party , a liberal party . later in his life , einsteins political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism , which he detailed in his essays such as " why socialism ? " the fbi created a secret dossier on einstein in 1932 , and by the time of his death his fbi file was 1427 pages long . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein was deeply impressed by mahatma gandhi , with whom he exchanged written letters . he described gandhi as " a role model for the generations to come " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews . he said he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic god of baruch spinozas philosophy . he did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings , a view which he described as naïve . he clarified , however , that " i am not an atheist " , preferring to call himself an agnostic , or a " deeply religious nonbeliever " . when asked if he believed in an afterlife , einstein replied , " no . and one life is enough for me . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein was primarily affiliated with non - religious humanist and ethical culture groups in both the uk and us . he served on the advisory board of the first humanist society of new york , and was an honorary associate of the rationalist association , which publishes new humanist in britain . for the 75th anniversary of the new york society for ethical culture , he stated that the idea of ethical culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism . he observed , " without ' ethical culture ' there is no salvation for humanity . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a german - language letter to philosopher eric gutkind , dated 3 january 1954 , einstein wrote : the word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses , the bible a collection of honorable , but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish . no interpretation no matter how subtle can ( for me ) change this . for me the jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions . and the jewish people to whom i gladly belong and with whose mentality i have a deep affinity have no different quality for me than all other people . i cannot see anything ' chosen ' about them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break on 17 april 1955 , einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm , which had previously been reinforced surgically by rudolph nissen in 1948 . he took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of israels seventh anniversary with him to the hospital , but he did not live to complete it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein refused surgery , saying , " i want to go when i want . it is tasteless to prolong life artificially . i have done my share ; it is time to go . i will do it elegantly . " he died in the university medical center of princeton at plainsboro early the next morning at the age of 76 , having continued to work until near the end . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the autopsy , the pathologist thomas stoltz harvey removed einsteins brain for preservation without the permission of his family , in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent . and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a memorial lecture delivered on 13 december 1965 at unesco headquarters , nuclear physicist robert oppenheimer summarized his impression of einstein as a person : " he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldliness there was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein bequeathed his personal archives , library , and intellectual assets to the hebrew university of jerusalem in israel . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break throughout his life , einstein published hundreds of books and articles . he published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non - scientific ones . on 5 december 2014 , universities and archives announced the release of einsteins papers , comprising more than 30000 unique documents . einsteins intellectual achievements and originality have made the word " einstein " synonymous with " genius " . in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the bose–einstein statistics , the einstein refrigerator and others . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the annus mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect ( which gave rise to quantum theory ) , brownian motion , the special theory of relativity , and e mc2 that einstein published in the annalen der physik scientific journal in 1905 . these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space , time , and matter . the four papers are : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einsteins first paper submitted in 1900 to annalen der physik was on capillary attraction . it was published in 1901 with the title " folgerungen aus den capillaritätserscheinungen " , which translates as " conclusions from the capillarity phenomena " . two papers he published in 1902–1903 ( thermodynamics ) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view . these papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on brownian motion , which showed that brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist . his research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations , giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point . ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density . at the critical point , this derivative is zero , leading to large fluctuations . the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered , making the fluid look milky white . einstein relates this to rayleigh scattering , which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength , and which explains why the sky is blue . einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations , and demonstrated how both the effect and rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einsteins " zur elektrodynamik bewegter körper " ( " on the electrodynamics of moving bodies " ) was received on 30 june 1905 and published 26 september of that same year . it reconciled conflicts between maxwells equations ( the laws of electricity and magnetism ) and the laws of newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics . observationally , the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds ( where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light ) . the theory developed in this paper later became known as einsteins special theory of relativity . there is evidence from einsteins writings that he collaborated with his first wife , mileva marić , on this work . the decision to publish only under his name seems to have been mutual , but the exact reason is unknown . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this paper predicted that , when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer , a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down , and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion . this paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in his paper on mass–energy equivalence , einstein produced emc2 as a consequence of his special relativity equations . einsteins 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years , but was accepted by leading physicists , starting with max planck . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics ( the study of moving bodies ) . in 1908 , hermann minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime . einstein adopted minkowskis formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break general relativity ( gr ) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by einstein between 1907 and 1915 . according to general relativity , the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses . general relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics . it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes , regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as einstein later said , the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory , while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion ( even accelerated ones ) should appear more satisfactory . consequently , in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity . in that article titled " on the relativity principle and the conclusions drawn from it " , he argued that free fall is really inertial motion , and that for a free - falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply . this argument is called the equivalence principle . in the same article , einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation , gravitational redshift and deflection of light . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1911 , einstein published another article " on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of light " expanding on the 1907 article , in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies . thus , the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1916 , einstein predicted gravitational waves , ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves , traveling outward from the source , transporting energy as gravitational radiation . the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it . by contrast , gravitational waves cannot exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation , which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first , indirect , detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars , psr b191316 . the explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves . einsteins prediction was confirmed on 11 february 2016 , when researchers at ligo published the first observation of gravitational waves , detected on earth on 14 september 2015 , nearly one hundred years after the prediction . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while developing general relativity , einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory . he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible . he gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in june 1913 , the entwurf ( ' draft ' ) theory was the result of these investigations . as its name suggests , it was a sketch of a theory , less elegant and more difficult than general relativity , with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions . after more than two years of intensive work , einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in november 1915 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1917 , einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole . he discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic , either contracting or expanding . as observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time , einstein introduced a new term , the cosmological constant , to the field equations , in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe . the modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature , in accordance with einsteins understanding of machs principle in these years . this model became known as the einstein world or einsteins static universe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by edwin hubble in 1929 , einstein abandoned his static model of the universe , and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos , the friedmann - einstein universe of 1931 and the einstein–de sitter universe of 1932 . in each of these models , einstein discarded the cosmological constant , claiming that it was " in any case theoretically unsatisfactory " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in many einstein biographies , it is claimed that einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his " biggest blunder " . the astrophysicist mario livio has recently cast doubt on this claim , suggesting that it may be exaggerated . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in late 2013 , a team led by the irish physicist cormac oraifeartaigh discovered evidence that , shortly after learning of hubbles observations of the recession of the nebulae , einstein considered a steady - state model of the universe . in a hitherto overlooked manuscript , apparently written in early 1931 , einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter , a process he associated with the cosmological constant . as he stated in the paper , " in what follows , i would like to draw attention to a solution to equation ( 1 ) that can account for hubbels sic facts , and in which the density is constant over time " " if one considers a physically bounded volume , particles of matter will be continually leaving it . for the density to remain constant , new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break it thus appears that einstein considered a steady - state model of the expanding universe many years before hoyle , bondi and gold . however , einsteins steady - state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break general relativity includes a dynamical spacetime , so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum . noethers theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a lagrangian with translation invariance , but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry . the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by noethers prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason : the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates . he maintained that the non - covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was , in fact , the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field . this approach has been echoed by lev landau and evgeny lifshitz , and others , and has become standard . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the use of non - covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by erwin schrödinger and others . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1935 , einstein collaborated with nathan rosen to produce a model of a wormhole , often called einstein–rosen bridges . his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations , in line with the program outlined in the paper " do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles ? " . these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break if one end of a wormhole was positively charged , the other end would be negatively charged . these properties led einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the theory of general relativity has a fundamental lawthe einstein field equations , which describe how space curves . the geodesic equation , which describes how particles move , may be derived from the einstein field equations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since the equations of general relativity are non - linear , a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields , like a black hole , would move on a trajectory which is determined by the einstein field equations themselves , not by a new law . so einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution , like a black hole , would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this was established by einstein , infeld , and hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum , and by roy kerr for spinning objects . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a 1905 paper , einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles ( quanta ) . einsteins light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists , including max planck and niels bohr . this idea only became universally accepted in 1919 , with robert millikans detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect , and with the measurement of compton scattering . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein concluded that each wave of frequency f is associated with a collection of photons with energy hf each , where h is plancks constant . he does not say much more , because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave . but he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results , notably the photoelectric effect . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1907 , einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator . in the einstein model , each atom oscillates independently—a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator . einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult , but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics . peter debye refined this model . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break throughout the 1910s , quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems after ernest rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets , niels bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by planck and developed by einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms , and the periodic table of the elements . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments wilhelm wien had made . wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process . einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant . arnold sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1924 , einstein received a description of a statistical model from indian physicist satyendra nath bose , based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles . einstein noted that boses statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles , and submitted his translation of boses paper to the zeitschrift für physik . einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications , among them the bose–einstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures . it was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by eric allin cornell and carl wieman using ultra - cooling equipment built at the nist–jila laboratory at the university of colorado at boulder . bose–einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons . einsteins sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in 1906 , he had not given up on academia . in 1908 , he became a privatdozent at the university of bern . in " über die entwicklung unserer anschauungen über das wesen und die konstitution der strahlung " ( " the development of our views on the composition and essence of radiation " ) , on the quantization of light , and in an earlier 1909 paper , einstein showed that max plancks energy quanta must have well - defined momenta and act in some respects as independent , point - like particles . this paper introduced the photon concept ( although the name photon was introduced later by gilbert lewis in 1926 ) and inspired the notion of wave–particle duality in quantum mechanics . einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new , unified foundation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913 , planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero - point energy in his " second quantum theory " . soon , this idea attracted the attention of einstein and his assistant otto stern . assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero - point energy , they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data . the numbers matched nicely . however , after publishing the findings , they promptly withdrew their support , because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero - point energy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1917 , at the height of his work on relativity , einstein published an article in physikalische zeitschrift that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission , the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with plancks distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode . this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics , because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein discovered louis de broglies work and supported his ideas , which were received skeptically at first . in another major paper from this era , einstein gave a wave equation for de broglie waves , which einstein suggested was the hamilton–jacobi equation of mechanics . this paper would inspire schrödingers work of 1926 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein played a major role in developing quantum theory , beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect . however , he became displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925 , despite its acceptance by other physicists . he was skeptical that the randomness of quantum mechanics was fundamental rather than the result of determinism , stating that god " is not playing at dice " . until the end of his life , he continued to maintain that quantum mechanics was incomplete . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1935 , einstein returned to quantum mechanics , in particular to the question of its completeness , in a collaboration with boris podolsky and nathan rosen that laid out what would become known as the epr paradox . in a thought experiment , they considered two particles , which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated . no matter how far the two particles were separated , a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle ; likewise , a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle , without needing to disturb the other particle in any way . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break given einsteins concept of local realism , there were two possibilities : ( 1 ) either the other particle had these properties already determined , or ( 2 ) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle . einstein rejected this second possibility ( popularly called " spooky action at a distance " ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einsteins belief in local realism led him to assert that , while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question , it must be incomplete . but as a physical principle , local realism was shown to be incorrect when the aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed bells theorem , which bell had delineated in 1964 . the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which " particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical - like entities , each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although einstein was wrong about local realism , his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite , entangled quantum states , has resulted in the epr paper becoming among the most influential papers published in physical review . it is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following his research on general relativity , einstein attempted to generalize his theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as aspects of a single entity . in 1950 , he described his " unified field theory " in a scientific american article titled " on the generalized theory of gravitation " . although he was lauded for this work , his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break notably , einsteins unification project did not accommodate the strong and weak nuclear forces , neither of which were well understood until many years after his death . although mainstream physics long ignored einsteins approaches to unification , einsteins work has motivated modern quests for a theory of everything , in particular string theory , where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum - mechanical setting . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned . these pertain to force , superconductivity , and other research . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to longtime collaborators leopold infeld , nathan rosen , peter bergmann and others , einstein also had some one - shot collaborations with various scientists . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein and de haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons , nowadays known to be the spin . in order to show this , they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum . they confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate , because the electrons angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes . this experiment needed to be sensitive because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small , but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein suggested to erwin schrödinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a bose–einstein gas by considering a box . then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator . quantizing these oscillators , each level will have an integer occupation number , which will be the number of particles in it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break this formulation is a form of second quantization , but it predates modern quantum mechanics . erwin schrödinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas . schrödinger urged einstein to add his name as co - author , although einstein declined the invitation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1926 , einstein and his former student leó szilárd co - invented ( and in 1930 , patented ) the einstein refrigerator . this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while traveling , einstein wrote daily to his wife elsa and adopted stepdaughters margot and ilse . the letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the hebrew university of jerusalem . margot einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public , but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death ( she died in 1986 ) . barbara wolff , of the hebrew universitys albert einstein archives , told the bbc that there are about 3500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einsteins right of publicity was litigated in 2015 in a federal district court in california . although the court initially held that the right had expired , that ruling was immediately appealed , and the decision was later vacated in its entirety . the underlying claims between the parties in that lawsuit were ultimately settled . the right is enforceable , and the hebrew university of jerusalem is the exclusive representative of that right . corbis , successor to the roger richman agency , licenses the use of his name and associated imagery , as agent for the university . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein became one of the most famous scientific celebrities , beginning with the confirmation of his theory of general relativity in 1919 . despite the general public having little understanding of his work , he was widely recognized and received adulation and publicity . in the period before world war ii , the new yorker published a vignette in their " the talk of the town " feature saying that einstein was so well known in america that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain " that theory " . he finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries . he told his inquirers " pardon me , sorry ! always i am mistaken for professor einstein . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels , films , plays , and works of music . he is a favorite model for depictions of absent - minded professors ; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated . time magazines frederic golden wrote that einstein was " a cartoonists dream come true " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many popular quotations are often misattributed to him . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break einstein received numerous awards and honors , and in 1922 , he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics " for his services to theoretical physics , and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect " . none of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by alfred nobel , so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to einstein in 1922 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break drawing uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 93: Afghanistan ***********

afghanistan , officially the islamic emirate of afghanistan , ; is a landlocked country located at the crossroads of central and south asia . referred to as the heart of asia , it is bordered by pakistan to the east and south , iran to the west , turkmenistan to the northwest , uzbekistan to the north , tajikistan to the northeast , and china to the northeast and east . occupying 652864 km2 of land , the country is predominately mountainous with plains in the north and the southwest , which are separated by the hindu kush mountain range . , its population is 40 million , composed mostly of ethnic pashtuns , tajiks , hazaras , and uzbeks . kabul is the countrys largest city and serves as its capital . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break human habitation in afghanistan dates back to the middle paleolithic era , and the countrys strategic location along the historic silk road has led it to being described , picturesquely , as the ‘roundabout of the ancient world’ . known as the graveyard of empires , the land has historically been home to various peoples and has witnessed numerous military campaigns , including those by alexander the great , the maurya empire , arab muslims , the mongols , the british , the soviet union , and most recently by an american - led coalition . afghanistan also served as the source from which the greco - bactrians and the mughals , among others , rose to form major empires . the various conquests and periods in both the iranian and indian cultural spheres made the area a center for zoroastrianism , buddhism , hinduism , and later islam throughout history . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the modern state of afghanistan began with the durrani dynasty in the 18th century , with the durrani afghan empire being formed by ahmad shah durrani . the durrani empire led conquests in which , at its peak , encompassed land that spanned from eastern iran to northern india . following its decline and the death of ahmad shah durrani , and timur shah , it was divided into multiple smaller independent kingdoms , including but not limited to : herat , kandahar and kabul . afghanistan would be reunited in the 19th century after wars of unification led by dost mohammad khan , where he conquered the independent principalities in afghanistan . dost mohammad died in 1863 , weeks after his last campaign to unite afghanistan , and as a result , threw afghanistan back into civil war with his successors . during this time , afghanistan became a buffer state in the great game between the british empire ( in british - ruled india ) and the russian empire ; from india , the british attempted to subjugate afghanistan but were repelled in the first anglo - afghan war ; however , the second anglo - afghan war saw a british victory and the successful establishment of british political influence over afghanistan . following the third anglo - afghan war in 1919 , afghanistan became free of foreign dominance , and eventually emerged as the independent kingdom of afghanistan in june 1926 under amanullah khan . this monarchy lasted almost 50 years , until zahir shah was overthrown in 1973 , following which the republic of afghanistan was established . since the late 1970s , afghanistans history has been dominated by extensive warfare , including coups , revolutions , invasions , insurgencies , and civil wars . the country is currently under the control of the taliban , an islamist political movement that returned to power in 2021 after a 20 - year - long war with the united states and its allies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to the effects of war , the country has dealt with high levels of terrorism , poverty , and child malnutrition . afghanistans economy is the worlds 96th - largest , with a gross domestic product ( gdp ) of 72 billion by purchasing power parity ; the country fares much worse in terms of per - capita gdp ( ppp ) , ranking 169th out of 186 countries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afghanistan is prominently rich in natural resources . those resources include lithium , iron , zinc , and copper , amongst many others . it is also the largest producer of opium . the country is a founding member of the united nations , the organisation of islamic cooperation , and the world trade organisation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the root name " afghān " is , according to some scholars , derived from the sanskrit name of the aśvakan or assakan , ancient inhabitants of the hindu kush region . aśvakan literally means " horsemen " , " horse breeders " , or " cavalrymen " ( from aśva or aspa , the sanskrit and avestan words for " horse " ) . historically , the ethnonym afghān was used to refer to ethnic pashtuns . the arabic and persian form of the name , afġān , was first attested in the 10th - century geography book hudud al - ' alam . the last part of the name , " - stan " is a persian suffix for " place of " . therefore , " afghanistan " translates to " land of the afghans " , or " land of the pashtuns " in a historical sense . according to the third edition of the encyclopedia of islam : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in afghanistan , such as the greco - bactrians , indo - scythians , kushans , kidarites , hephthalites , alkhons , nezaks , zunbils , turk shahis , hindu shahis , lawiks , saffarids , samanids , ghaznavids , ghurids , khaljis , kartids , lodis , surs , mughals , and finally , the hotak and durrani dynasties , which marked the political origins of the modern state . throughout millennia several cities within the modern day afghanistan served as capitals of various empires , namely , bactra ( balkh ) , alexandria on the oxus ( ai - khanoum ) , kapisi , sigal , kabul , kunduz , zaranj , firozkoh , herat , ghazna ( ghazni ) , binban ( bamyan ) , and kandahar . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the country has been home to various peoples through the ages , among them the ancient iranian peoples who established the dominant role of indo - iranian languages in the region . at multiple points , the land has been incorporated within vast regional empires ; among them the achaemenid empire , the macedonian empire , the maurya empire , and the islamic empire . for its success in resisting foreign occupation during the 19th and 20th centuries , afghanistan has been called the " graveyard of empires " , though it is unknown who coined the phrase . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break excavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now afghanistan at least 50000 years ago , and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world . an important site of early historical activities , many believe that afghanistan compares to egypt in terms of the historical value of its archaeological sites . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break archaeological exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east , west , and north . artifacts typical of the paleolithic , mesolithic , neolithic , bronze , and iron ages have been found in afghanistan . urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 bce , and the early city of mundigak ( near kandahar in the south of the country ) was a center of the helmand culture . more recent findings established that the indus valley civilization stretched up towards modern - day afghanistan , making the ancient civilization today part of pakistan , afghanistan , and india . in more detail , it extended from what today is northwest pakistan to northwest india and northeast afghanistan . an indus valley site has been found on the oxus river at shortugai in northern afghanistan . there are several smaller ivc colonies to be found in afghanistan as well . an indus valley site has been found on the oxus river at shortugai in northern afghanistan , shows afghanistan to have been a part of indus valley civilization . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after 2000 bce , successive waves of semi - nomadic people from central asia began moving south into afghanistan ; among them were many indo - european - speaking indo - iranians . these tribes later migrated further into south asia , western asia , and toward europe via the area north of the caspian sea . the region at the time was referred to as ariana . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by the middle of the 6th century bce , the achaemenids overthrew the medes and incorporated arachosia , aria , and bactria within its eastern boundaries . an inscription on the tombstone of darius i of persia mentions the kabul valley in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered . the region of arachosia , around kandahar in modern - day southern afghanistan , used to be primarily zoroastrian and played a key role in the transfer of the avesta to persia and is thus considered by some to be the " second homeland of zoroastrianism " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break alexander the great and his macedonian forces arrived in afghanistan in 330 bce after defeating darius iii of persia a year earlier in the battle of gaugamela . following alexanders brief occupation , the successor state of the seleucid empire controlled the region until 305 bce when they gave much of it to the maurya empire as part of an alliance treaty . the mauryans controlled the area south of the hindu kush until they were overthrown in about 185 bce . their decline began 60 years after ashokas rule ended , leading to the hellenistic reconquest by the greco - bactrians . much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the indo - greek kingdom . they were defeated and expelled by the indo - scythians in the late 2nd century bce . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the silk road appeared during the first century bce , and afghanistan flourished with trade , with routes to china , india , persia and north to the cities of bukhara , samarkand and khiva in present - day uzbekistan . goods and ideas were exchanged at this center point , such as chinese silk , persian silver and roman gold , while the region of present afghanistan was mining and trading lapis lazuli stones mainly from the badakhshan region . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the first century bce , the parthian empire subjugated the region but lost it to their indo - parthian vassals . in the mid - to - late first century ce the vast kushan empire , centered in afghanistan , became great patrons of buddhist culture , making buddhism flourish throughout the region . the kushans were overthrown by the sassanids in the 3rd century ce , though the indo - sassanids continued to rule at least parts of the region . they were followed by the kidarites who , in turn , was replaced by the hephthalites . they were replaced by the turk shahi in the 7th century . the buddhist turk shahi of kabul was replaced by a hindu dynasty before the saffarids conquered the area in 870 , this hindu dynasty was called hindu shahi . much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by buddhist culture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arab muslims brought islam to herat and zaranj in 642ce and began spreading eastward ; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted . before the arrival of islam , the region used to be home to various beliefs and cults , often resulting in syncretism between the dominant religions such as zoroastrianism , hinduism , christianity and judaism . an exemplification of the syncretism in the region would be that people were patrons of buddhism but still worshipped local iranian gods such as ahura mazda , lady nana , anahita or mihr ( mithra ) and portrayed greek gods like heracles or tyche as protectors of buddha . the zunbils and kabul shahi were first conquered in 870ce by the saffarid muslims of zaranj . later , the samanids extended their islamic influence south of the hindu kush . it is reported that muslims and non - muslims still lived side by side in kabul before the ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by the 11th century , mahmud of ghazni defeated the remaining hindu rulers and effectively islamized the wider region , with the exception of kafiristan . mahmud made ghazni into an important city and patronized intellectuals such as the historian al - biruni and the poet ferdowsi . the ghaznavid dynasty was overthrown by the ghurids , whose architectural achievements included the remote minaret of jam . the ghurids controlled afghanistan for less than a century before being conquered by the khwarazmian dynasty in 1215 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1219ce , genghis khan and his mongol army overran the region . his troops are said to have annihilated the khwarazmian cities of herat and balkh as well as bamyan . the destruction caused by the mongols forced many locals to return to an agrarian rural society . mongol rule continued with the ilkhanate in the northwest while the khalji dynasty administered the afghan tribal areas south of the hindu kush until the invasion of timur ( aka tamerlane ) , who established the timurid empire in 1370 . under the rule of shah rukh the city served as the focal point of the timurid renaissance , whose glory matched florence of the italian renaissance as the center of a cultural rebirth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the early 16th century , babur arrived from ferghana and captured kabul from the arghun dynasty . babur would go on to conquer the afghan lodi dynasty who had ruled the delhi sultanate in the first battle of panipat . between the 16th and 18th century , the uzbek khanate of bukhara , iranian safavids , and indian mughals ruled parts of the territory . during the medieval period , the northwestern area of afghanistan was referred to by the regional name khorasan . two of the four capitals of khorasan ( herat and balkh ) are now located in afghanistan , while the regions of kandahar , zabulistan , ghazni , kabulistan , and afghanistan formed the frontier between khorasan and hindustan . however , up to the 19th century the term khorasan was commonly used among natives to describe their country ; sir george elphinstone wrote with amazement that the country known to outsiders as " afghanistan " was referred to by its own inhabitants as " khorasan " and that the first afghan official whom he met at the border welcomed him to khorasan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1709 , mirwais hotak , a local ghilzai tribal leader , successfully rebelled against the safavids . he defeated gurgin khan and established his own kingdom . mirwais died of natural causes in 1715 and was succeeded by his brother abdul aziz , who was soon killed by mirwais ' son mahmud for possibly planning to concede territories back to the safavids . mahmud led the afghan army in 1722 to the persian capital of isfahan , captured the city after the battle of gulnabad and proclaimed himself king of persia . the afghan dynasty was ousted from persia by nader shah after the 1729 battle of damghan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1738 , nader shah and his forces captured kandahar in the siege of kandahar , the last hotak stronghold , from shah hussain hotak . soon after , the persian and afghan forces invaded india , nader shah had plundered delhi , alongside his 16 year old commander , ahmad shah durrani who had assisted him on these campaigns . nader shah was assassinated in 1747 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the death of nader shah in 1747 , ahmad shah durrani had returned to kandahar with a contingent of 4000 pashtuns . the abdalis had " unanimously accepted " ahmad shah as their new leader . with his acension in 1747 , ahmad shah had led multiple campaigns against the mughal empire , maratha empire , and then receding , afsharid empire . ahmad shah had captured kabul and peshawar from the mughal appointed governor , nasir khan . ahmad shah had then conquered herat in 1750 , and had also captured kashmir in 1752 . ahmad shah had launched two campaigns into khorasan , ( 1750–1751 ) and ( 1754–1755 ) . his first campaign had seen the siege of mashhad , however he was forced to retreat after 4 months . in november 1750 , he moved to siege nishapur , however he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751 . ahmad shah returned in 1754 , he captured tun , and on 23 july , he sieged mashhad once again . mashhad had fallen on 2 december , however shah rokh was reappointed in 1755 . he was forced to give up torshiz , bakharz , jam , khaf , and turbat - e haidari to the afghans . following this , ahmad shah had sieged nishapur once again , and captured it . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ahmad shah invaded india 8 times during his reign . with the capture of peshawar , ahmad shah had used this as a convenient striking point to lead his military campaigns into punjab and india . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ahmad shah had sought out multiple reasons for his invasions , ahmad shah saw afghanistan in a dire state , and one that needed to expand and exploit a weak but rich neighboring country , which ahmad shah had capitalized on in multiple opportunities during his invasions of india , he sought the reasons needed to fill his treasury in a war - plunder conquest based economy . ahmad shah had launched his first invasion in 1748 , crossing the indus river , his armies sacked and absorbed lahore into the durrani realm . ahmad shah had met mughal armies at the battle of manupur ( 1748 ) , where he was defeated and forced to retreat to back to afghanistan . ahmad shah had returned the next year in 1749 , where he had captured the area around lahore and punjab , presenting it as an afghan victory for this campaign . from 1749 to 1767 , ahmad shah would lead 6 more invasions , the most important being his sixth invasion , with the third battle of panipat , which created a power vacumn in northern india , halting maratha expansion . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ahmad shah durrani had died in october 1772 , what followed would be a civil war in succession , with his named successor , timur shah

wali khan , the influential prime minister of the durrani empire , and humayun mirza . timur shah began his reign by consolidating power toward himself and people loyal to him , purging durrani sardars and influential tribal leaders in kabul and kandahar to bring support toward himself . timur shahs reforms also saw the capital of the durrani empire being shifted from kandahar to kabul , being able to cover the empire better as a base of ordination since it was essentially the heartland of the empire . this reform saw kabul as the modern capital of afghanistan today . having consolidated power to himself , timur shah would fight multiple series of rebellions to consolidate and hold the empire apart , timur shah would also lead campaigns into punjab against the sikhs like his father did , however being more successful . most prominent example of his battles during this campaign would be where timur shah led his forces under zangi khan durrani , with over 18000 men total of afghan , qizilbash , and mongol cavalrymen . against over 60000 sikh men . the sikhs would lose over 30000 in this battle and would stage a durrani resurgence in punjab . the durranis lost multan in 1772 after ahmad shahs death , following this victory by timur shah , timur shah was able to lay siege to multan and recapture it , incorporating it into the durrani empire once again , reintegrating it as a province until the siege of multan ( 1818 ) . timur shah would be succeeded by his son , zaman shah durrani after his death on 18 or 20 may 1793 . timur shahs reign oversaw the attempted stabilization and consolidation of the empire . however , timur shah had over 24 sons , a mistake that would plunge the empire in civil war over succession crises . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

position on the throne , zaman shah had led 3 campaigns into punjab , with the first two campaigns capturing lahore , but being forced to retreat due to issues from a possible qajar invasion , or his brother , mahmud shah durrani revolting . zaman shah embarked on his third campaign for punjab in 1800 to deal with a rebellious ranjit singh . however , he was forced to withdraw , with his brother , mahmud shah durrani revolting , zaman shah would be toppled from his reign , replaced by his brother , mahmud shah durrani . however , just under 2 years in his reign , mahmud shah durrani would be deposed by his brother , shah shuja durrani , on 13 july 1803 . shah shuja would attempt to consolidate the durrani realm , which had been long striven by civil war . shah shuja would later be deposed by his brother at the battle of nimla ( 1809 ) , where mahmud shah durrani would defeat and force shah shuja to flee , with shah mahmud usurping the throne again for his second reign beginning on 3

positions of power throughout the empire , mostly ruling as governors of major cities and provinces . after his murder for apparent treason against the durrani king . fateh khan would be sentenced by mahmud shah durrani , having him executed . his brothers , notably including dost mohammad khan , rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire between themselves . during this turbulent period , afghanistan had many temporary rulers until dost mohammad khan declared himself emir in 1826 . punjab and kashmir were lost to ranjit singh , who invaded khyber pakhtunkhwa in march 1823 and captured the city of peshawar at the battle of nowshera . in 1837 , during the battle of jamrud near the khyber pass , akbar khan and the afghan army failed to capture the jamrud fort from the sikh khalsa army , but killed sikh commander hari singh nalwa , thus ending the afghan - sikh wars . by this time the british were advancing from the east and the first major conflict during " the great game " was initiated . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1838 , a british expeditionary force marched into afghanistan and arrested dost mohammad , sent him into exile in india and replaced him with shah

of elphinstones army , and the battle of kabul that led to its recapture , the british gave up on their attempts to try and subjugate afghanistan , and allowed dost mohammad khan as ruler and withdrew their military forces from afghanistan . dost mohammad khan would spend most of his reign consolidating the parts of afghanistan that were lost in the durrani civil wars . dost mohammad khan would launch numerous campaigns , and also be able to reunite the afghan realm in his reign , securing herat ( 1793–1863 ) in the herat campaign of 1862–63 . dost mohammad died on 9 june 1863 , a few months after his campaign to capture herat . dost mohammads successors would fight for the throne of afghanistan , between sher ali khan , mohammad afzal khan , and mohammad azam khan in the afghan civil war ( 1863–1869 ) . sher ali would win this civil war and would go on to rule the realm until in 1878 , the british had returned in the second anglo - afghan war which was fought over perceived russian influence in the region , abdur rahman khan replaced ayub khan who had succeeded sher ali khan after his death in 1879 . britain would gain control of afghanistans foreign relations as part of the treaty of gandamak of 1879 , making it an official british protected state . in 1893 , amir abdur rahman signed an agreement in which the ethnic pashtun and baloch territories were divided by the durand line , which forms the modern - day border between pakistan and afghanistan . shia - dominated hazarajat and pagan kafiristan remained politically independent until being conquered by abdur rahman khan in 1891–1896 . he was known as the " iron amir " for his features and his ruthless methods against tribes . the iron amir viewed railway and telegraph lines coming from the russian and british as " trojan horses " and therefore prevented railway development in afghanistan . he died in 1901 , succeeded by his son , habibullah khan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

population for keeping neutrality against the british . habibullah was assassinated during a hunting trip in february 1919 , and amanullah khan eventually assumed power . a staunch supporter of the 1915–1916 expeditions , amanullah khan provoked the third anglo - afghan war , entering british india via the khyber pass . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the end of the third anglo - afghan war and the signing of the treaty of rawalpindi on 19 august 1919 , emir amanullah khan declared the emirate of afghanistan a sovereign and fully independent state . he moved to end his countrys traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community , particularly with the soviet union and the weimar republic of germany . he proclaimed himself king of afghanistan on 9 june 1926 , when the emirate of afghanistan became the kingdom of afghanistan . following a 1927–28 tour of europe and turkey , he introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation . a key force behind these reforms was mahmud tarzi , an ardent supporter of the education of women . he fought for article 68 of afghanistans 1923 constitution , which made elementary education compulsory . the institution of slavery was abolished in the emirate of afghanistan in 1923 . king amanullahs wife , queen soraya , was an important figure during this period in the fight for womans education and against their oppression . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some of the reforms that were put in place , such as the abolition of the traditional burqa for women and the opening of several co - educational

1929 , and soon after kabul fell to saqqawist forces led by habibullah kalakani . prince mohammed nadir shah , amanullahs cousin , in turn defeated and killed kalakani in october 1929 , and was declared king nadir shah . he abandoned the reforms of king amanullah in favor of a more gradual approach to modernization , but was assassinated in 1933 by abdul khaliq , a fifteen - year - old

amanullah loyalists . close relations with the muslim states turkey , the hashemite kingdom of iraq and iran / persia were also pursued , while further international relations were sought by joining the league of nations in 1934 . the 1930s saw the development of roads , infrastructure , the founding of a national bank , and increased education . road links in the north played a large part in a growing cotton and textile industry . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break until 1946 , king zahir ruled with the assistance of his uncle , who held the post of prime minister and continued the policies of nadir

he expected . he was replaced in 1953 by mohammed daoud khan , the kings cousin and brother - in - law , and a pashtun nationalist who sought the creation of a pashtunistan , leading to highly tense relations with pakistan . during his ten years at the post until 1963 , daoud khan pressed for social modernization reforms and sought a closer relationship with the soviet union . afterward , the 1964 constitution was formed , and the first non - royal prime minister was sworn in . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break king zahir shah , like his father nadir shah , had a policy of maintaining national independence while pursuing gradual modernization , creating nationalist feeling , and improving relations with the united kingdom . however , afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in world war ii nor aligned with either power bloc in the cold war thereafter . however , it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the soviet union and the united states vied for influence by building afghanistans main highways , airports , and other vital infrastructure in the post - war period . on a per capita basis , afghanistan received more soviet development aid than any other country . afghanistan had , therefore , good relations with both cold war enemies . in 1973 , while the king was in italy , daoud khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first president of afghanistan , abolishing the monarchy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in april 1978 , the communist peoples democratic party of afghanistan ( pdpa ) seized power in a bloody coup d ' état

peoples democratic party general secretary nur muhammad taraki . this would trigger a series of events that would dramatically turn afghanistan from a poor and secluded ( albeit peaceful ) country to a hotbed of international terrorism . the pdpa initiated various social , symbolic and land distribution reforms that provoked strong opposition , while also brutally oppressing political dissidents . this caused unrest and quickly expanded into a state of civil war by 1979 , waged by guerrilla mujahideen ( and smaller maoist guerrillas ) against regime forces countrywide . it quickly turned into a proxy war as the pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers , the united states supported them through pakistans inter - services intelligence ( isi ) , and the soviet union sent thousands of military advisers to support the pdpa regime . meanwhile , there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the pdpa– the dominant khalq and the more moderate parcham . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in september 1979 , pdpa general secretary taraki was assassinated in an internal coup orchestrated by fellow khalq member , then - prime minister hafizullah

government , the soviet army invaded the country in december 1979 , heading for kabul and killing amin just three days later . a soviet - organized regime , led by parchams babrak karmal but inclusive of both factions ( parcham and khalq ) , filled the vacuum . soviet troops in more substantial numbers were deployed to stabilize afghanistan under karmal , marking the beginning of the soviet–afghan war . the united states and pakistan , lasting nine years , the war caused the deaths of between 562000 and 2million afghans , and displaced about 6million people who subsequently fled afghanistan , mainly to pakistan and iran . heavy air bombardment destroyed many countryside villages , millions of landmines were planted , and some cities such as herat and kandahar were also damaged from bombardment . pakistans north - west frontier province functioned as an organizational and networking base for the anti - soviet afghan resistance , with the provinces influential deobandi ulama playing a major supporting role in promoting the ' jihad ' . after the soviet withdrawal , the civil war ensued until the communist regime under peoples democratic party leader mohammad najibullah collapsed in 1992 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the soviet - afghan war had drastic social effects on afghanistan . the militarization of society led to heavily armed police , private bodyguards , openly

two decades of war as well as an acute famine at the time , afghanistan had one of the highest infant and child mortality rates in the world , the lowest life expectancy , much of the population were

investment , government corruption , and the taliban insurgency . meanwhile , karzai attempted to unite the peoples of the country , and the afghan government was able to build some democratic structures , adopting a constitution in 2004 with the name islamic republic of afghanistan . attempts were made , often with the support of foreign donor countries , to improve the countrys economy ,

tajikistan , and the turkmenistan - afghanistan - pakistan - india ( tapi ) gas pipeline . power is managed by the da afghanistan breshna sherkat ( dabs , afghanistan electricity company ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break important dams include the kajaki dam , dahla dam , and the sardeh band dam . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break tourism is a small industry in afghanistan due to security issues . nevertheless , some 20000 foreign tourists visit the country annually as of 2016 . in particular an important region for domestic and international tourism is the picturesque bamyan valley , which includes lakes , canyons and historical sites , helped by the fact it is in a safe area away from insurgent activity . smaller numbers visit and trek in regions such as the wakhan valley , which is also one of the worlds most remote communities . from the late 1960s onwards , afghanistan was a popular stop on the famous hippie trail , attracting many europeans and americans . coming from iran , the trail traveled through various afghan provinces and cities including herat , kandahar and kabul before crossing to northern pakistan , northern india , and nepal . tourism peaked in 1977 , the year before the start of political instability and armed conflict . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the city of ghazni has significant history and historical sites , and together with bamyan city have in recent years been voted islamic cultural capital and south asia cultural capital respectively . the cities of herat , kandahar , balkh , and zaranj are also very historic . the minaret of jam in the hari river valley is a unesco world heritage site . a cloak reputedly worn by islams prophet muhammad is kept inside the shrine of the cloak in kandahar , a city founded by alexander the great and the first capital of afghanistan . the citadel of alexander in the western city of herat has been renovated in recent years and is a popular attraction . in the north of the country is the shrine of ali , believed by many to be the location where ali was buried . the national museum of afghanistan is located in kabul and hosts a large number of buddhist , bactrian greek and early islamic antiquities ; the museum suffered greatly by civil war but has been slowly restoring since the early 2000s . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break telecommunication services in afghanistan are provided by afghan telecom , afghan wireless , etisalat , mtn group , and roshan . the country uses its own space satellite called afghansat 1 , which provides services to millions of phone , internet , and television subscribers . by 2001 following years of civil war , telecommunications was virtually a non - existent sector , but by 2016 it had grown to a 2billion industry , with 22million mobile phone subscribers and 5million internet users . the sector employs at least 120000 people nationwide . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break due to afghanistans geography , transport between various parts of the country has historically been difficult . the backbone of afghanistans road network is highway 1 , often called the " ring road " , which extends for 2210 km and connects five major cities : kabul , ghazni , kandahar , herat and mazar - i - sharif , with spurs to kunduz and jalalabad and various border crossings , while skirting around the mountains of the hindu kush . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the ring road is crucially important for domestic and international trade and the economy . a key portion of the ring road is the salang tunnel , completed in 1964 , which facilitates travel through the hindu kush mountain range and connects northern and southern afghanistan . it is the only land route that connects central asia to the indian subcontinent . several mountain passes allow travel between the hindu kush in other areas . serious traffic accidents are common on afghan roads and highways , particularly on the kabul–kandahar and the kabul–jalalabad road . traveling by bus in afghanistan remains dangerous due to militant activities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break air transport in afghanistan is provided by the national carrier , ariana afghan airlines , and by the private company kam air . airlines from a number of countries also provide flights in and out of the country . these include air india , emirates , gulf air , iran aseman airlines , pakistan international airlines , and turkish airlines . the country has four international airports : hamid karzai international airport ( formerly kabul international airport ) , kandahar international airport , herat international airport , and mazar - e sharif international airport . including domestic airports , there are 43 . bagram air base is a major military airfield . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the country has three rail links : one , a 75 km line from mazar - i - sharif to the uzbekistan border ; a 10 km long line from toraghundi to the turkmenistan border ( where it continues as part of turkmen railways ) ; and a short link from aqina across the turkmen border to kerki , which is planned to be extended further across afghanistan . these lines are used for freight only and there is no passenger service . a rail line between khaf , iran and herat , western afghanistan , intended for both freight and passengers , is under construction as of 2019 . about 125 km of the line will lie on the afghan side . there are various proposals for the construction of additional rail lines in the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break private vehicle ownership has increased substantially since the early 2000s . taxis are yellow in color and consist of both cars and auto rickshaws . in rural afghanistan , villagers often use donkeys , mules or horses to transport or carry goods . camels are primarily used by the kochi nomads . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afghans have both common cultural features and those that differ between the regions of afghanistan , each with distinctive cultures partly as a result of geographic obstacles that divide the country . in the southern and eastern region , the people live according to the pashtun culture by following pashtunwali ( the pashtun way ) . key tenets of pashtunwali include hospitality , the provision of sanctuary to those seeking refuge , and revenge for the shedding of blood . the pashtuns are largely connected to the culture of central asia and the iranian plateau . the remaining afghans are culturally persian and turkic . some non - pashtuns who live in proximity with pashtuns have adopted pashtunwali in a process called pashtunization , while some pashtuns have been persianized . those who have lived in pakistan and iran over the last 30 years have been further influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations . the afghan people are known to be strongly religious . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afghans , particularly pashtuns , are noted for their tribal solidarity and high regard for personal honor . one writer considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult , and in a society that , from a materialistic point of view , has an uncomplicated lifestyle . there are various afghan tribes , and an estimated 2–3million nomads . afghan culture is deeply islamic , but pre - islamic practices persist . one example is bacha bazi , a term for activities involving sexual relations between older men and younger adolescent men , or boys . child marriage is prevalent in afghanistan ; the legal age for marriage is 16 . the most preferred marriage in afghan society is to ones parallel cousin , and the groom is often expected to pay a bride price . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the villages , families typically occupy mudbrick houses , or compounds with mudbrick or stone walled houses . villages typically have a headman ( malik ) , a master for water distribution ( mirab ) and a religious teacher ( mullah ) . men would typically work on the fields , joined by women during harvest . about 15 of the population are nomadic , locally called kochis . when nomads pass villages they often buy supplies such as tea , wheat and kerosene from the villagers ; villagers buy wool and milk from the nomads . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afghan clothing for both men and women typically consists of various forms of shalwar kameez , especially perahan tunban and khet partug . women would normally wear a chador for head covering ; some women , typically from highly conservative communities , wear the burqa , a full body covering . these were worn by some women of the pashtun community well before islam came to the region , but the taliban enforced this dress on women when they were in power . another popular dress is the chapan which acts as a coat . the karakul is a hat made from the fur of a specific regional breed of sheep . it was favored by former kings of afghanistan and became known to much of the world in the 21st century when it was constantly worn by president hamid karzai . the pakol is another traditional hat originating from the far east of the country ; it was popularly worn by the guerrilla leader ahmad shah massoud . the mazari hat originates from northern afghanistan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the nation has a complex history that has survived either in its current cultures or in the form of various languages and monuments . afghanistan contains many remnants from all ages , including greek and buddhist stupas , monasteries , monuments , temples and islamic minarets . among the most well known are the great mosque of herat , the blue mosque , the minaret of jam , the chil zena , the qala - i bost in lashkargah , the ancient greek city of ai - khanoum . however , many of its historic monuments have been damaged in modern times due to the civil wars . the two famous buddhas of bamiyan were destroyed by the taliban , who regarded them as idolatrous . despite that , archaeologists are still finding buddhist relics in different parts of the country , some of them dating back to the 2nd century . as there was no colonialism in the modern era in afghanistan , european - style architecture is rare but does exist : the victory arch at paghman and the darul aman palace in kabul were built in this style in the 1920s by the afghans themselves . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break carpet weaving is an ancient practice in afghanistan , and many of these are still handmade by tribal and nomadic people today . some crafters express their feelings through the designs of rugs ; for example after the outbreak of the soviet–afghan war , " war rugs " , a variant of afghan rugs , were created with designs representing pain and misery caused by the conflict . every province has its own specific characteristics in making rugs . in some of the turkic - populated areas in the north - west , bride and wedding ceremony prices are driven by the brides weaving skills . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pottery has been crafted in afghanistan for millennia . the village of istalif , north of kabul , is in particular a major center , known for its unique turquoise and green pottery , and their methods of crafting have remained the same for centuries . much of lapis lazuli stones were earthed in modern - day afghanistan which were used in chinese porcelain as cobalt blue , later used in ancient mesopotamia and turkey . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the lands of afghanistan have a long history of art , with the worlds earliest known usage of oil painting found in cave murals in the country . a notable art style that developed in afghanistan and eastern pakistan is gandhara art , produced by a fusion of greco - roman art and buddhist art between the 1st and 7th centuries ce . later eras saw increased use of the persian miniature style , with kamaleddin behzad of herat being one of the most notable miniature artists of the timurid and early safavid periods . since the 1900s , the nation began to use western techniques in art . abdul ghafoor breshna was a prominent afghan painter and sketch artist from kabul during the 20th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break afghanistan has around 350 radio

of mystical poems in the 12th century , and , finally , rumi of balkh , in the 13th century , considered the persophonist throughout the world as the greatest mystical poet of the entire muslim world . the afghan pashto literature , although quantitatively remarkable and in great growth in the last century , has always had an essentially local meaning and importance , feeling the influence of both persian literature and the contiguous literatures of india . both main literatures , from the second half of the nineteenth century , have shown themselves to be sensitive to genres ( novel , theater

*********** Article 94: Albania ***********

albania ( ; or shqipëria ) , ; officially the republic of albania , is a country in southeastern europe . it is located on the adriatic and ionian seas within the mediterranean sea and shares land borders with montenegro to the northwest , kosovo to the northeast , north macedonia to the east and greece to the south . tirana is its capital and largest city , followed by durrës , vlorë , and shkodër . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albania displays varied climatic , geological , hydrological , and morphological conditions , defined in an area of 28748 sqkm . it possesses significant diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow - capped mountains in the albanian alps as well as the korab , skanderbeg , pindus and ceraunian mountains to the hot and sunny coasts of the albanian adriatic and ionian sea along the mediterranean sea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albania has been inhabited by different civilisations over time , such as the illyrians , thracians , greeks , romans , byzantines , venetians , and ottomans . the albanians established the autonomous principality of arbër in the 12th century . the kingdom of albania and principality of albania formed between the 13th and 14th centuries . prior to the ottoman conquest of albania in the 15th century , the albanian resistance to ottoman expansion into europe led by skanderbeg won them acclaim over most of europe . albania remained under ottoman rule for nearly five centuries , during which many albanians ( known as arnauts ) attained high - ranking offices in the empire , especially in the southern balkans and egypt . between the 18th and 19th centuries , cultural developments , widely attributed to albanians having gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength , conclusively led to the albanian renaissance . after the defeat of the ottomans in the balkan wars , the modern nation state of albania declared independence in 1912 . in the 20th century , the kingdom of albania was invaded by italy , which formed greater albania before becoming a protectorate of nazi germany . enver hoxha formed the peoples socialist republic of albania after world war ii , modeled under the terms of hoxhaism . the revolutions of 1991 concluded the fall of communism in albania and eventually the establishment of the current republic of albania . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albania is a unitary parliamentary constitutional republic and a developing country with an upper - middle income economy dominated by the service sector , followed by manufacturing . it went through a process of transition following the end of communism in 1990 , from centralised planning to a market - based economy . albania provides universal health care and free primary and secondary education to its citizens . albania is a member of the united nations , world bank , unesco , nato , wto , coe , osce , and oic . it has been an official candidate for membership in the european union since 2014 . it is one of the founding members of the energy community , including the organization of the black sea economic cooperation and union for the mediterranean . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term albania is the medieval latin name of the country . it may be derived from the illyrian tribe of albani recorded by ptolemy , the geographer and astronomer from alexandria , who drafted a map in 150ad which shows the city of albanopolis located northeast of durrës . the term may have a continuation in the name of a medieval settlement called albanon or arbanon , although it is not certain that this was the same place . in his history written in the 10th century , the byzantine historian michael attaliates was the first to refer to albanoi as having taken part in a revolt against constantinople in 1043 and to the arbanitai as subjects of the duke of dyrrachium . during the middle ages , the albanians called their country arbëri or arbëni and referred to themselves as arbëreshë or arbëneshë . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nowadays , albanians call their country shqipëri or shqipëria . the words shqipëri and shqiptar are attested from 14th century onwards , but it was only at the end of 17th and beginning of the early 18th centuries that the placename shqipëria and the ethnic demonym shqiptarë gradually replaced arbëria and arbëreshë amongst albanian speakers . the two terms are popularly interpreted as " land of the eagles " and " children of the eagles " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the first attested traces of neanderthal presence in the territory of albania dates back to the middle and upper paleolithic period and were discovered in xarrë and at mount dajt in the adjacent region of tirana . archaeological sites from this period include the kamenica tumulus , konispol cave and pellumbas cave . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the discovered objects in a cave near xarrë include flint and jasper objects along with fossilised animal bones , while those discoveries at mount dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the aurignacian culture . they also demonstrate notable similarities with objects of the equivalent period found at crvena stijena in montenegro and northwestern greece . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break multiple artefacts from the iron and bronze ages near tumulus burials have been unearthed in central and southern albania , which has similar affinity with the sites in southwestern macedonia and lefkada . archaeologists have come to the conclusion that these regions were inhabited from the middle of the third millennium bc by indo - european people who spoke a proto - greek language . hence , a part of this historical population later moved to mycenae around 1600 bc and properly established the mycenaean civilisation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in ancient times , the incorporated territory of albania was historically inhabited by indo - european peoples , among them numerous illyrian tribes , ancient greeks and thracians . in view of the illyrian tribes , there is no evidence that these tribes used any collective nomenclature for themselves , while it is regarded to be unlikely that they used a common endonym . the endonym illyrians seems to be the name applied to a specific illyrian tribe , which was the first to come in liaison with the ancient greeks resulting in the endonym illyrians to be applied pars pro toto to all people of similar language and customs uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the territory referred to as illyria corresponded roughly to the area east of the adriatic sea in the mediterranean sea extending in the south to the mouth of the vjosë . the first account of the illyrian groups comes from periplus of the euxine sea , an ancient greek text written in the middle of the 4th century bc . other colonies such as apollonia , epidamnos , and amantia , were established by ancient greek city - states on the coast by the 7th century bc . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the illyrian ardiaei tribe , centred in montenegro , ruled over most of the territory of albania . their ardiaean kingdom reached its greatest extent under king agron , the son of pleuratus ii . agron extended his rule over other neighbouring tribes as well . following agrons death in 230 bc , his wife , teuta , inherited theardiaean kingdom . teutas forces extended their operations further southwards to theionian sea . in 229 bc , rome declared war on the kingdom for extensively plundering roman ships . the war ended in illyrian defeat in 227bc . teuta was eventually succeeded bygentiusin 181bc . gentius clashed with the romans in 168bc , initiating the third illyrian war . the conflict resulted in roman conquest of the region by 167bc . the romans split the region into three administrative divisions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the roman empire was split in 395 upon the death of theodosius i into an eastern and western roman empire in part because of the increasing pressure from threats during the barbarian invasions . from the 6th century into the 7th century , the slavs crossed the danube and largely absorbed the indigenous ancient greeks , illyrians and thracians in the balkans ; thus , the illyrians were mentioned for the last time in historical records in the 7th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 11th century , the great schism formalised the break of communion between the eastern orthodox and western catholic church that is reflected in albania through the emergence of a catholic north and orthodox south . the albanian people inhabited the west of lake ochrida and the upper valley of river shkumbin and established the principality of arbanon in 1190 under the leadership of progon of kruja . the realm was succeeded by his sons gjin and dhimitri . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break upon the death of dhimiter , the territory came under the rule of the albanian - greek gregory kamonas and subsequently under the golem of kruja . in the 13th century , the principality was dissolved . arbanon is considered to be the first sketch of an albanian state , that retained a semi - autonomous status as the western extremity of the byzantine empire , under the byzantine doukai of epirus or laskarids of nicaea . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break towards the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th centuries , serbs and venetians started to take possession over the territory . the ethnogenesis of the albanians is uncertain ; however the first undisputed mention of albanians dates back in historical records from 1079 or 1080 in a work by michael attaliates , who referred to the albanoi as having taken part in a revolt against constantinople . at this point the albanians were fully christianised . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break few years after the dissolution of arbanon , charles of anjou concluded an agreement with the albanian rulers , promising to protect them and their ancient liberties . in 1272 , he established the kingdom of albania and conquered regions back from the despotate of epirus . the kingdom claimed all of central albania territory from dyrrhachium along the adriatic sea coast down to butrint . a catholic political structure was a basis for the papal plans of spreading catholicism in the balkan peninsula . this plan found also the support of helen of anjou , a cousin of charles of anjou . around 30 catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule mainly in northern albania . internal power struggles within the byzantine empire in the 14th century enabled serbs ' most powerful medieval ruler , stefan dusan , to establish a short - lived empire that included all of albania except durrës . in 1367 , various albanian rulers established the despotate of arta . during that time , several albanian principalities were created , notably the principality of albania , principality of kastrioti , lordship of berat and principality of dukagjini . in the first half of the 15th century , the ottoman empire invaded most of albania , and the league of lezhë was held under skanderbeg as a ruler , who became the national hero of the albanian medieval history . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the fall of constantinople , the ottoman empire continued an extended period of conquest and expansion with its borders going deep into southeast europe . they reached the albanian ionian sea coast in 1385 and erected their garrisons across southern albania in 1415 and then occupied most of albania in 1431 . thousands of albanians consequently fled to western europe , particularly to calabria , naples , ragusa and sicily , whereby others sought protection at the often inaccessible mountains of albania . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the albanians , as christians , were considered an inferior class of people , and as such they were subjected to heavy taxes among others by the devshirme system that allowed the sultan to collect a requisite percentage of christian adolescents from their families to compose the janissary . the ottoman conquest was also accompanied with the gradual process of islamisation and the rapid construction of mosques which consequently modified the religious picture of albania . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a prosperous and longstanding revolution erupted after the formation of the assembly of lezhë until the siege of shkodër under the leadership of gjergj kastrioti skanderbeg , multiple times defeating major ottoman armies led by sultans murad ii and mehmed ii . skanderbeg managed to gather several of the albanian principals , amongst them the arianitis , dukagjinis , zaharias and thopias , and establish a centralised authority over most of the non - conquered territories , becoming the lord of albania . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break skanderbeg consistently pursued the goal relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to constitute a european coalition against the ottomans . he thwarted every attempt by the ottomans to regain albania , which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of italy and western europe . his unequal fight against them won the esteem of europe also among others financial and military aid from the papacy and naples , venice and ragusa . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break when the ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region , albanian towns were organised into four principal sanjaks . the government fostered trade by settling a sizeable jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in spain . the city of vlorë saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from europe such as velvets , cotton goods , mohairs , carpets , spices and leather from bursa and constantinople . some citizens of vlorë even had business associates throughout europe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the phenomenon of islamisation among the albanians became primarily widespread from the 17th century and continued into the 18th century . islam offered them equal opportunities and advancement within the ottoman empire . however , motives for conversion were , according to some scholars , diverse depending on the context though the lack of source material does not help when investigating such issues . because of increasing suppression of catholicism , most catholic albanians converted in the 17th century , while orthodox albanians followed suit mainly in the following century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since the albanians were seen as strategically important , they made up a significant proportion of the ottoman military and bureaucracy . a couple of muslim albanians attained important political and military positions who culturally contributed to the broader muslim world . enjoying this privileged position , they held various high administrative positions with over two dozen albanian grand viziers . others included members of the prominent köprülü family , zagan pasha , muhammad ali of egypt and ali pasha of tepelena . furthermore , two sultans , bayezid ii and mehmed iii , both had mothers of albanian origin . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the albanian renaissance was a period with its roots in the late 18th century and continuing into the 19th century , during which the albanian people gathered spiritual and intellectual strength for an independent cultural and political life within an independent nation . modern albanian culture flourished too , especially albanian literature and arts , and was frequently linked to the influences of the romanticism and enlightenment principles . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break prior to the rise of nationalism , albania was under the rule of the ottoman empire for almost five centuries , and ottoman authorities suppressed any expression of national unity or conscience by the albanian people . through literature , albanians started to make a conscious effort to awaken feelings of pride and unity among their people that would call to mind the rich history and hopes for a more decent future . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the victory of russia over the ottoman empire following the russian - ottoman wars resulted the execution of the treaty of san stefano which overlooked to assign albanian - populated lands to the slavic and greek neighbours . however , the united kingdom and austro - hungarian empire consequently blocked the arrangement and caused the treaty of berlin . from this point , albanians started to organise themselves with the goal to protect and unite the albanian - populated lands into a unitary nation , leading to the formation of the league of prizren . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the league had initially the assistance of the ottoman authorities whose position was based on the religious solidarity of muslim people and landlords connected with the ottoman administration . they favoured and protected the muslim solidarity and called for defence of muslim lands simultaneously constituting the reason for titling the league committee of the real muslims uvmr_ev_paragraph_break approximately 300 muslims participated in the assembly composed by delegates from bosnia , the administrator of the sanjak of prizren as representatives of the central authorities and no delegates from vilayet of scutari . signed by only 47 muslim deputies , the league issued the kararname that contained a proclamation that the people from northern albania , epirus and bosnia and herzegovina are willing to defend the territorial integrity of the ottoman empire by all possible means against the troops of bulgaria , serbia and montenegro . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ottomans authorities cancelled their assistance when the league , under abdyl frashëri , became focused on working towards albanian autonomy and requested merging four vilayets , including kosovo , shkodër , monastir and ioannina , into an unified vilayet , the albanian vilayet . the league used military force to prevent the annexing areas of plav and gusinje assigned to montenegro . after several successful battles with montenegrin troops , such as the battle of novšiće , the league was forced to retreat from their contested regions . the league was later defeated by the ottoman army sent by the sultan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albania declared independence from the ottoman empire on 28 november 1912 , accompanied with the establishment of the senate and government by the assembly of vlorë on 4 december 1912 . its sovereignty was recognised by the conference of london . on 29 july 1913 , the treaty of london delineated the borders of the country and its neighbours , leaving many albanians outside albania , predominantly partitioned between montenegro , serbia and greece . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break headquartered in vlorë , the international commission of control was established on 15 october 1913 to take care of the administration of newly established albania , until its own political institutions were in order . the international gendarmerie was established as the first law enforcement agency of the principality of albania . in november , the first gendarmerie members arrived in the country . prince of albania wilhelm of wied ( princ vilhelm vidi ) was selected as the first prince of the principality . on 7 march , he arrived in the provisional capital of durrës and started to organise his government , appointing turhan pasha përmeti to form the first albanian cabinet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in november 1913 , the albanian pro - ottoman forces had offered the throne of albania to the ottoman war minister of albanian origin , ahmed izzet pasha . the pro - ottoman peasants believed that the new regime was a tool of the six christian great powers and local landowners , that owned half of the arable land . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in february 1914 , the autonomous republic of northern epirus was proclaimed in gjirokastër by the local greek population against incorporation to albania . this initiative was short - lived , and in 1921 the southern provinces were incorporated into the albanian principality . meanwhile , the revolt of albanian peasants against the new albanian regime erupted under the leadership of the group of muslim clerics gathered around essad pasha toptani , who proclaimed himself the saviour of albania and islam . in order to gain support of the mirdita catholic volunteers from the northern part of albania , prince wied appointed their leader , prênk bibë doda , to be the foreign minister of the principality of albania . in may and june 1914 , the international gendarmerie was joined by isa boletini and his men , mostly from kosovo , and northern mirdita catholics , were defeated by the rebels who captured most of central albania by the end of august 1914 . the regime of prince wied collapsed , and he left the country on 3 september 1914 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following the end of the government of fan noli , the parliament adopted a new constitution and proclaimed the country as a parliamentary republic in which king zog i of albania ( ahmet muhtar zogu ) served as the head of state for a seven - year term . immediately after , tirana was endorsed officially as the countrys permanent capital . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the politics of zogu was authoritarian and conservative with the primary aim of the maintenance of stability and order . he was forced to adopt a policy of cooperation with italy where a pact had been signed between both countries , whereby italy gained a monopoly on shipping and trade concessions . italians exercised control over nearly every albanian official through money and patronage . in 1928 , the country was eventually replaced by another monarchy with a strong support by the fascist regime of italy however , both maintained close relations until the italian invasion of the country . zogu remained a conservative but initiated reforms and placed great emphasis on the development of infrastructure . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in an attempt at social modernisation , the custom of adding ones region to ones name was dropped . he also made donations of land to international organisations for the building of schools and hospitals . the armed forces were trained and supervised by instructors from italy , and as a counterweight , he kept british officers in the gendarmerie despite strong italian pressure to remove them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after being militarily occupied by italy from 1939 until 1943 , the kingdom of albania was a protectorate and a dependency of the kingdom of italy governed by victor emmanuel iii and his government . in october 1940 , albania served as a staging ground for an unsuccessful italian invasion of greece . a counterattack resulted in a sizeable portion of southern albania coming under greek military control until april 1941 when greece capitulated during the german invasion . in april 1941 , territories of yugoslavia with substantial albanian population were annexed to albania inclusively western macedonia , a strip of eastern montenegro , the town of tutin in central serbia and most of kosovo . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break germans started to occupy the country in september 1943 and subsequently announced that they would recognise the independence of a neutral albania and set about organising a new government , military and law enforcement . balli kombëtar , which had fought against italy , formed a neutral government and side by side with the germans fought against the communist - led national liberation movement of albania . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the last years of the war , the country fell into a civil war - like state between the communists and nationalists . the communists defeated the last anti - communist forces in the south in 1944 . before the end of november , the main german troops had withdrawn from tirana , and the communists took control by attacking it . the partisans entirely liberated the country from german occupation on 29 november 1944 . a provisional government , which the communists had formed atberatin october , administered albania with enver hoxha as the head of government . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break by the end of the second world war , the main military and political force of the nation , the communist party sent forces to northern albania against the nationalists to eliminate its rivals . they faced open resistance in nikaj - mërtur , dukagjin and kelmend led by prek cali . on 15 january 1945 , a clash took place between partisans of the first brigade and nationalist forces at the tamara bridge , resulting in the defeat of the nationalist forces . about 150 kelmendi people were killed or tortured . this event was the starting point of many other issues which took place during enver hoxhas dictatorship . class struggle was strictly applied , human freedom and human rights were denied . the kelmend region was almost isolated by both the border and by a lack of roads for another 20 years , the institution of agricultural cooperatives brought about economic decline . many kelmendi people fled , and some were executed trying to cross the border . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the aftermath of world war ii and the defeat of the axis powers , the country became initially a satellite state of the soviet union , and enver hoxha emerged as the leader of the newly established peoples republic of albania . soviet - albanian relations began to deteriorate after stalins death in 1953 . at this point , the country started to develop foreign relations with other communist countries , among others with the peoples republic of china . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during this period , the country experienced an increasing industrialisation and urbanisation , a rapid collectivisation and economic growth which led to a higher standard of living . the government called for the development of infrastructure and most notably the introduction of a railway system that completely revamped transportation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the new land reform laws were passed granting ownership of the land to the workers and peasants who tilled it . agriculture became cooperative , and production increased significantly , leading to the country becoming agriculturally self - sufficient . in the field of education , illiteracy was eliminated among the countrys adult population . the government also oversaw the emancipation of women and the expansion of healthcare and education throughout the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the average annual increase in the countrys national income was 29 and 56 higher than the world and european average , respectively . the nation incurred large debts initially with yugoslavia until 1948 , then the soviet union until 1961 and china from the middle of the 1950s . the constitution of the communist regime did not allow taxes on individuals , instead , taxes were imposed on cooperatives and other organisations , with much the same effect . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break today a secular state without any official religion , religious freedoms and practises were severely curtailed during the communist era with all forms of worship being outlawed . in 1945 , the agrarian reform law meant that large swaths of property owned by religious groups were nationalised , mostly the waqfs along with the estates of mosques , tekkes , monasteries and dioceses . many believers , along with the ulema and many priests , were arrested and executed . in 1949 , a new decree on religious communities required that all their activities be sanctioned by the state alone . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after hundreds of mosques and dozens of islamic libraries containing priceless manuscripts were destroyed , hoxha proclaimed albania the worlds first atheist state in 1967 . the churches had not been spared either and many were converted into cultural centres for young people . a 1967 law banned all fascist , religious , and antisocialist activity and propaganda . preaching religion carried a three to ten - year prison sentence . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nonetheless , many albanians continued to practise their beliefs secretly . the anti - religious policy of hoxha attained its most fundamental legal and political expression a decade later : " the state recognises no religion " , states the 1976 constitution , " and supports and carries out atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after forty years of communism and isolation as well as the revolutions of 1989 , people , most notably students , became politically active and campaigned against the government that led to the transformation of the existing order . following the popular support in the first multi - party elections of 1991 , the communists retained a stronghold in the parliament until the victory in the general elections of 1992 led by the democratic party . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break considerable economic and financial resources were devoted to pyramid schemes that were widely supported by the government . the schemes swept up somewhere between one sixth and one third of the population of the country . despite the warnings of the international monetary fund , sali berisha defended the schemes as large investment firms , leading more people to redirect their remittances and sell their homes and cattle for cash to deposit in the schemes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the schemes began to collapse in late 1996 , leading many of the investors to join initially peaceful protests against the government , requesting their money back . the protests turned violent in february 1997 as government forces responded by firing on the demonstrators . in march , the police and republican guard deserted , leaving their armouries open . these were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs . the resulting civil war caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals and refugees . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the crisis led both aleksandër meksi and sali berisha to resign from office in the wake of the general election . in april 1997 , operation alba , a un peacekeeping force led by italy , entered the country with two goals exclusively to assist with the evacuation of expatriates and to secure the ground for international organisations . the main international organisation that was involved was the western european unions multinational albanian police element , which worked with the government to restructure the judicial system and simultaneously the albanian police . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following the disintegration of the communist system , albania focused on an active process of westernisation with the goal of accession to the european union ( eu ) and the north atlantic treaty organisation ( nato ) . in 2009 , the country , together with croatia , gained active membership in nato , becoming among the first countries in southeast europe to do so . it also applied to join the european union on 28 april 2009 , receiving official candidate status on 24 june 2014 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break edi rama of the socialist party won both the 2013 and 2017 parliamentary elections . as prime minister , he implemented numerous reforms

countrys total fertility rate of 1 children born per woman is one of the lowest in the world . its population density stands at 259 inhabitants per square kilometre . the overall life expectancy at birth is 78 years ; 75 years for males and 81 years for females . it is forecast that the population will continue shrinking for the next decade at least , depending on the actual birth rate and the level of net migration . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the explanation for the recent population decrease is the fall of communism in albania in the late twentieth century . that period was marked by economic mass emigration from albania to greece , italy and the united states . four decades of total isolation from the world , combined with its disastrous economic , social and political situation , had caused this exodus . the external migration was prohibited outright during the communist era , while internal migration was quite limited , hence this was a new phenomenon . at least 900000 people left albania during this period , with about 600000 of them settling in greece . the migration affected the countrys internal population distribution . it decreased particularly in the north and south , while it increased in the centre within the cities of tirana and durrës . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break about 53 of the countrys population lives in cities . the three largest counties by population account for half of the total population . almost 30 of the total population is found in tirana county followed by fier county with 11 and durrës county with 10 . over 1 million people are

uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gjirokastër uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sarandë uvmr_ev_paragraph_break issues of ethnicity are a delicate topic and subject to debate . contrary to official statistics that show an over 97 per cent albanian majority in the country , minority groups ( such as greeks , macedonians , montenegrins , roma and aromanians ) have frequently disputed the official numbers , asserting a higher percentage of the countrys population . according to the disputed 2011 census , ethnic affiliation was as follows : albanians 2312356 ( 82 of the total ) , greeks 24243 ( 0 ) , macedonians 5512 ( 0 ) , montenegrins 366 ( 0 ) , aromanians 8266 ( 0 ) , romani 8301 ( 0 ) , balkan egyptians 3368 ( 0 ) , other ethnicities 2644 ( 0 ) , no declared ethnicity 390938 ( 14 ) , and not relevant 44144 (

albanian minorities are the gorani people and jews . regarding the greeks , " it is difficult to know how many greeks there are in albania " . the estimates vary between 60000 and 300000 ethnic greeks in albania . according to ian jeffries , most of western sources put the number at around 200000 . the 300000 mark is supported by greek government as well . the cia world factbook estimates the greek minority to constitute 0 of the total population . the us state department estimates that greeks make up 1 , and other minorities 0 , of the population . the latter questions the validity of the census data about the greek minority , due to the fact that measurements have been affected by boycott . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break macedonians and some greek minority groups have sharply criticised article 20 of the census law , according to which a 1000 fine will be imposed on anyone who will declare an ethnicity other than what is stated on his or her birth certificate . this is claimed to be an attempt to intimidate minorities into declaring albanian ethnicity ; according to them the albanian government has stated that it will jail anyone who does not participate in the census or refuse to declare his or her ethnicity . genc pollo , the minister in charge has declared that : " albanian citizens will be able to freely express their ethnic and religious affiliation and mother tongue . however , they are not forced to answer these sensitive questions " . the amendments criticised do not include jailing or forced declaration of ethnicity or religion ; only a fine is envisioned which can be overthrown by court . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break greek representatives form part of the albanian parliament and the government has invited albanian greeks to register , as the only way to improve their status . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the official language of the country is albanian which is spoken by the vast majority of the countrys population . its standard spoken and written form is

dialect of greek that preserves features now lost in standard modern greek is spoken in areas inhabited by the greek minority . other languages spoken by ethnic minorities in albania include aromanian , serbian , macedonian , bosnian , bulgarian , gorani , and roma . macedonian is official in the pustec municipality in east albania . according to the 2011 population census , 2765610 or 98 of the population declared albanian as their mother tongue ( mother tongue is defined as the first or main language spoken at home during childhood ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in recent years , the shrinking number of pupils in schools dedicated to the greek minority has caused problems for teachers . the greek language is spoken by an important percentage in the southern part of the country , due to cultural and economic links with adjacent greece . in a 2017 study carried out by instat , the albanian government statistical agency , 39 of the 25–64 years old is able to use at least one foreign language , with english first at 40 , followed by italian with 27 and greek with 22 . among young people aged 25 or less , english , german and turkish have seen rising interest after 2000 . italian and french have had a stable interest , while greek has lost much of its previous interest . the trends are linked with cultural and economic factors . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break greek is the second most - spoken language in the country , with 0 to 3 of the population speaking it as first language , and with two - thirds of mainly albanian families having at least one member that speaks greek , most having learned it in the post communist era ( 1992–present ) due to private schools or migration to greece . as of 2003 greek was offered at over 100 private tutoring centres all over albania and at a private school in tirana , the first of its kind outside greece . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break young people have shown a growing interest in german language in recent years . some of them go to germany for studying or various experiences . albania and germany have agreements for cooperating in helping young people of the two countries know both cultures better . due to a sharp rise in economic relations with turkey , interest in learning turkish , in particular among young people , has been growing on a yearly basis . young people , attracted by economic importance of turkish investments and common values between the two nations , gain from cultural and academic collaboration of universities . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as of the 2011 census , there were 1587608 ( 56 ) sunni muslims , 280921 ( 10 )

in life after death . however , 40 believed in hell , while 42 believed in heaven . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the preliminary results of the 2011 census seemed to give widely different results , with 70 of respondents refusing to declare belief in any of the listed faiths . the albanian orthodox church officially refused to recognize the results , claiming that 24 of the total population adhered to its faith . some muslim community officials expressed unhappiness with the data claiming that many muslims were not counted and that the number of adherents numbered some 70 of the albanian population . the albanian catholic bishops conference also cast doubts on the census , complaining that many of its believers were not contacted . the muslim albanians are spread throughout the country . orthodox and bektashis are mostly found in the south , whereas catholics mainly live in the north . in 2008 , there were 694 catholic churches and 425 orthodox churches , 568 mosques and 70 bektashi tekkes in the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albania is a secular and religiously diverse country with no official religion and thus , freedom of religion , belief and conscience are guaranteed

the archbishopric of durrës was purportedly founded by paul the apostle , while preaching in illyria and epirus . meanwhile , in medieval times , the albanian people first appeared within historical records from the byzantines . at this point , they were mostly christianised . islam arrived for the first time in the late 9th century to the region , when arabs raided parts of the eastern banks of the adriatic sea . it later emerged as the majority religion , during centuries of ottoman rule , though a significant christian minority remained . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during modern times , the albanian republican , monarchic and later communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life . the country has never had an official religion either as a republic or as a kingdom . in the 20th century , the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s , under the state policy of obliterating all organised religion from the territories of albania . the communist regime persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion . the country was then officially declared to be the worlds first atheist state . religious freedom has returned , however , since the end of communism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break islam survived communist era persecution and reemerged in the modern era as a practised religion in albania . some smaller christian sects in albania include evangelicals and several protestant communities including seventh - day adventist church , church of jesus christ of latter - day saints and jehovahs witnesses . the first recorded protestant of albania was said toptani , who travelled around europe and returned to tirana in 1853 , where he preached protestantism . due to that , he was arrested and imprisoned by the ottoman authorities in 1864 . the first evangelical protestants appeared in the 19th century and the evangelical alliance was founded in 1892 . nowadays , it has 160 member congregations from different protestant denominations . following mass emigration to israel after the fall of communism , there are only 200 albanian jews left in the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break albania shares many symbols associated with its history , culture and belief . these include the colours red and black ,

poppy growing as well across the country . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the flag of albania is a red flag with a black double - headed eagle positioned in the centre . the red colour used in the flag symbolises the bravery , strength and valour of the albanian people , while the black colour appears as a symbol of freedom and heroism . gjergj kastrioti skënderbeu , who fought and began a rebellion against the ottoman empire which halted ottoman advance into europe for nearly 25 years , placed the double - headed eagle on his flag and seal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the countrys national motto , ti shqipëri , më jep nder , më jep emrin shqipëtar ( " you albania , you give me honour , you give me the name albanian " ) , finds its origins in the albanian national awakening . the first to express this motto was naim frashëri in his poem ti shqipëri më jep nder . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the artistic history of albania has been particularly influenced by a multitude of ancient and

in christian and islamic art in the lands of albania which are apparent in examples of architecture and mosaics throughout the country . centuries later , the albanian renaissance proved crucial to the emancipation of the modern albanian culture and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of literature and art whereas artists sought to return to the ideals of impressionism and romanticism .

albania reflects the legacy of various civilisations tracing back to the classical antiquity . major cities in albania have evolved from within the castle to include dwellings , religious and commercial structures , with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques . nowadays , the cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of various architectural styles . in the 20th century , many historical as well as sacred buildings bearing the ancient influence were demolished during the communist era . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ancient architecture is found throughout albania and most visible in byllis , amantia , phoenice , apollonia , butrint , antigonia , shkodër and durrës . considering the long period of rule of the byzantine empire , they introduced castles , citadels , churches and monasteries with spectacular wealth of visible murals and frescos . perhaps the best known examples can be found in the southern albanian cities and surroundings of korçë , berat , voskopojë and gjirokastër . involving the introduction of ottoman architecture there was a development of mosques and other islamic buildings , particularly seen in berat and gjirokastër . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a productive period of historicism , art nouveau and neoclassicism merged into the 19th century , best exemplified in korçë . the 20th century brought new architectural styles

, and as such , different parts of the country enjoy specific regional cuisines . cooking traditions especially vary between the north and the south , owing to differing topography and climate that

 uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break allah ( ; , ) is the common arabic word for god . in the english language , the word generally refers to god in islam . the word is thought to be derived by contraction from al - ilāh , which means " the god " , and is linguistically related to the aramaic words elah and ܐܲܠܵܗܵܐ ( ʼalâhâ ) and the hebrew word el ( elohim ) for god . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word allah has been used by arabic people of different religions since pre - islamic times . the pre - islamic arabs worshipped a supreme deity whom they called allah , alongside other lesser deities . muhammad used the word allah to indicate the islamic conception of god . allah has been used as a term for god by muslims ( both arab and non - arab ) and even arab christians after the term " al - ilāh " and " allah " were used interchangeably in classical arabic by the majority of arabs who had become muslims it is also often , albeit not exclusively , used in this way by bábists , baháʼís , mandaeans , indonesian and maltese christians , and sephardi jews . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break encyclopædia britannica . encyclopædia britannica similar usage by christians and sikhs in west malaysia has recently led to political and legal controversies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the etymology of the word allāh has been discussed extensively by classical arab philologists . grammarians of the basra school regarded it as either formed " spontaneously " ( murtajal ) or as the definite form of lāh ( from the verbal root lyh with the meaning of " lofty " or " hidden " ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cognates of the name " allāh " exist in other semitic languages , including hebrew and aramaic . the corresponding aramaic form is elah ( אלה ) , but its emphatic state is elaha ( אלהא ) . it is written as ܐܠܗܐ ( ʼĕlāhā ) in biblical aramaic and ܐܲܠܵܗܵܐ ( ʼalâhâ ) in syriac as used by the assyrian church , both meaning simply " god " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break regional variants of the word allah occur in both pagan and christian pre - islamic inscriptions . different theories have been proposed regarding the role of allah in pre - islamic polytheistic cults . according to the islamic scholar ibn kathir , arab pagans considered allah as an unseen god who created and controlled the universe . pagans believed worship of humans or animals who had lucky events in their life brought them closer to god . pre - islamic meccans worshiped allah alongside a host of lesser gods and those whom they called the “daughters of allah . islam forbade worship of anyone or thing other than god . some authors have suggested that polytheistic arabs used the name as a reference to a creator god or a supreme deity of their pantheon . the term may have been vague in the meccan religion . according to one hypothesis , which goes back to julius wellhausen , allah ( the supreme deity of the tribal federation around quraysh ) was a designation that consecrated the superiority of hubal ( the supreme deity of quraysh ) over the other gods . there is disagreement on whether allah played a major role in the meccan religious cult . no iconic representation of allah is known to have existed . allah is the only god in mecca that did not have an idol . muhammads fathers name was ʿabd - allāh meaning " the slave of allāh " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arabic - speakers of all abrahamic faiths , including christians and jews , use the word " allah " to mean " god " . except jehovahs witnesses who add the biblical name " jehovah " ( يهوه ) to the title " allah " . similarly , the aramaic word for " god " in the language of assyrian christians is ʼĕlāhā , or alaha . ( even the arabic - descended maltese language of malta , whose population is almost entirely catholic , uses alla for " god " . arab christians , for example , use the terms allāh al - ab ( الله الأب ) for god the father , allāh al - ibn ( الله الابن ) for god the son , and allāh ar - rūḥ al - quds ( الله الروح القدس ) for god the holy spirit . ( see god in christianity for the christian concept of god . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break arab christians have used two forms of invocations that were affixed to the beginning of their written works . they adopted the muslim bismillāh , and also created their own trinitized bismillāh as early as the 8th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to marshall hodgson , it seems that in the pre - islamic times , some arab christians made pilgrimage to the kaaba , a pagan temple at that time , honoring allah there as god the creator . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some archaeological excavation quests have led to the discovery of ancient pre - islamic inscriptions and tombs made by arab christians in the ruins of a church at umm el - jimal in northern jordan , which initially , according to enno littman ( 1949 ) , contained references to allah as the proper name of god . however , on a second revision by bellamy and others ( 1985 1988 ) the 5 - versed - inscription was re - translated as " ( 1 ) this inscription was set up by colleagues of ʿulayh , ( 2 ) son of ʿubaydah , secretary ( 3 ) of the cohort augusta secunda ( 4 ) philadelphiana ; may he go mad who ( 5 ) effaces it . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the syriac word ܐܠܗܐ ( ʼĕlāhā ) can be found in the reports and the lists of names of christian martyrs in south arabia , as reported by antique syriac documents of the names of those martyrs from the era of the himyarite and aksumite kingdoms uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in ibn ishaqs biography there is a christian leader named abd allah ibn abu bakr ibn muhammad , who was martyred in najran in 523 , as he had worn a ring that said " allah is my lord " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in an inscription of christian martyrion dated back to 512 , references to ' l - ilah ( الاله ) can be found in both arabic and aramaic . the inscription starts with the statement " by the help of ' l - ilah " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in pre - islamic gospels , the name used for god was " allah " , as evidenced by some discovered arabic versions of the new testament written by arab christians during the pre - islamic era in northern and southern arabia . however most recent research in the field of islamic studies by sydney griffith and others ( 2013 ) , david grafton ( 2014 ) , clair wilde ( 2014 ) ml hjälm and others ( 2016 2017 ) assert that " all one can say about the possibility of a pre - islamic , christian version of the gospel in arabic is that no sure sign of its actual existence has yet emerged . " additionally ml hjälm in her most recent research ( 2017 ) inserts that " manuscripts containing translations of the gospels are encountered no earlier than the year 873 " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break irfan shahîd quoting the 10th - century encyclopedic collection kitab al - aghani notes that pre - islamic arab christians have been reported to have raised the battle cry " ya la ibad allah " ( o slaves of allah ) to invoke each other into battle . according to shahid , on the authority of 10th - century muslim scholar al - marzubani , " allah " was also mentioned in pre - islamic christian poems by some ghassanid and tanukhid poets in syria and northern arabia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in islam , allah is the unique , omnipotent and only deity and creator of the universe and is equivalent to god in other abrahamic religions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to islamic belief , allah is the most common word to represent god , and humble submission to his will , divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the muslim faith . the quran declares " the reality of allah , his inaccessible mystery , his various names , and his actions on behalf of his creatures . " god is not a part of the christian trinity . god has no parents and no children . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the concept correlates to the tawhid , where chapter 112 of the quran ( al - ' ikhlās , the sincerity ) reads : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there is no deity but him , the alive , the eternal . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh him . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unto him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break who could intercede in his presence without his permission ? uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while they encompass nothing of his knowledge except what he wills . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break his throne includeth the heavens and the earth , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break and he is never weary of preserving them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break he is the sublime , the tremendous . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in islamic tradition , there are 99 names of god ( al - asmā ' al - ḥusná lit . meaning : ' the best names ' or ' the most beautiful names ' ) , each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of allah . all these names refer to allah , the supreme and all - comprehensive divine name . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most muslims use the untranslated arabic phrase in shā’a llāh ( meaning ' if god wills ' ) after references to future events . muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of bi - smi llāh ( meaning ' in the name of god ' ) . there are certain phrases in praise of god that are favored by muslims , including " subḥāna llāh " ( glory be to god ) , " al - ḥamdu li - llāh " ( praise be to god ) , " lā ilāha illā llāh " ( there is no deity but god ) or sometimes " lā ilāha illā inta / huwa " ( there is no deity but you / him ) and " allāhu akbar " ( god is the most great ) as a devotional exercise of remembering god ( dhikr ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in a sufi practice known as dhikr allah ( arabic : ذكر الله , lit . " remembrance of god " ) , the sufi repeats and contemplates the name allah or other associated divine names to him while controlling his or her breath . for example , in countless references in the context from the quran forementioned above : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 1 ) allah is referred to in the second person pronoun in arabic as " inta ( arabic : َإِنْت ) " like the english " you " , or commonly in the third person pronoun " huwa ( arabic : َهُو ) " like the english " he " and uniquely in the case pronoun of the oblique form " hu / huw ( arabic : هو / - هُ ) " like the english " him " which rhythmically resonates and is chanted as considered a sacred sound or echo referring allah as the " absolute breath or soul of life " - al - nafs al - hayyah ( arabic : النّفس الحياة , an - nafsu ' l - ḥayyah ) - notably among the 99 names of god , " the giver of life " ( al - muḥyī ) and " the bringer of death " ( al - mumiyt ) ; uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 2 ) allah is neither male or female ( who has no gender ) , but who is the essence of the " omnipotent , selfless , absolute soul ( an - nafs , النّفس ) and holy spirit " ( ar - rūḥ , الرّوح ) - notably among the 99 names of god , " the all - holy , all - pure and all - sacred " ( al - quddus ) ; uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 3 ) allah is the originator of both before and beyond the cycle of creation , destruction and time , - notably among the 99 names of god , " the first , beginning - less " ( al - awwal ) , " the end / beyond ' final ' , ' abode " ' / endless " ( al - akhir / al - ākhir ) and " the timeless " ( aṣ - ṣabūr ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to gerhard böwering , in contrast with pre - islamic arabian polytheism , god in islam does not have associates and companions , nor is there any kinship between god and jinn . pre - islamic pagan arabs believed in a blind , powerful , inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control . this was replaced with the islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful god . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break according to francis edward peters , " the qur’ān insists , muslims believe , and historians affirm that muhammad and his followers worship the same god as the jews . the qur’ans allah is the same creator god who covenanted with abraham " . peters states that the quran portrays allah as both more powerful and more remote than yahweh , and as a universal deity , unlike yahweh who closely follows israelites . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word allāh is generally pronounced , exhibiting a heavy lām , , a velarized alveolar lateral approximant , a marginal phoneme in modern standard arabic . since the initial alef has no hamza , the initial is elided when a preceding word ends in a vowel . if the preceding vowel is , the lām is light , , as in , for instance , the basmala . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the history of the name allāh in english was probably influenced by the study of comparative religion in the 19th century ; for example , thomas carlyle ( 1840 ) sometimes used the term allah but without any implication that allah was anything different from god . however , in his biography of muḥammad ( 1934 ) , tor andræ always used the term allah , though he allows that this " conception of god " seems to imply that it is different from that of the jewish and christian theologies . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break languages which may not commonly use the term allah to denote god may still contain popular expressions which use the word . for example , because of the centuries long muslim presence in the iberian peninsula , the word ojalá in the spanish language and oxalá in the portuguese language exist today , borrowed from arabic inshalla ( arabic : إن شاء الله ) . this phrase literally means ' if god wills ' ( in the sense of " i hope so " ) . the german poet mahlmann used the form " allah " as the title of a poem about the ultimate deity , though it is unclear how much islamic thought he intended to convey . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some muslims leave the name " allāh " untranslated in english , rather than using the english translation " god " . the word has also been applied to certain living human beings as personifications of the term and concept . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break christians in malaysia and indonesia use allah to refer to god in the malaysian and indonesian languages ( both of them standardized forms of the malay language ) . mainstream bible translations in the language use allah as the translation of hebrew elohim ( translated in english bibles as " god " ) . this goes back to early translation work by francis xavier in the 16th century . the first dictionary of dutch - malay by albert cornelius ruyl , justus heurnius , and caspar wiltens in 1650 ( revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 latin edition ) recorded " allah " as the translation of the dutch word " godt " . ruyl also translated the gospel of matthew in 1612 into the malay language ( an early bible translation into a non - european language , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break but compare : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break made a year after the publication of the king james version ) , which was printed in the netherlands in 1629 . then he translated the gospel of mark , published in 1638 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the government of malaysia in 2007 outlawed usage of the term allah in any other but muslim contexts , but the malayan high court in 2009 revoked the law , ruling it unconstitutional . while allah had been used for the christian god in malay for more than four centuries , the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of allah by the roman catholic newspaper the herald . the government appealed the court ruling , and the high court suspended implementation of its verdict until the hearing of the appeal . in october 2013 the court ruled in favor of the governments ban . in early 2014 the malaysian government confiscated more than 300 bibles for using the word to refer to the christian god in peninsular malaysia . however , the use of allah is not prohibited in the two malaysian states of sabah and sarawak . the main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long - established and local alkitab ( bibles ) have been widely distributed freely in east malaysia without restrictions for years . both states also do not have similar islamic state laws as those in west malaysia . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in reaction to some media criticism , the malaysian government has introduced a " 10 - point solution " to avoid confusion and misleading information . the 10 - point solution is in line with the spirit of the 18 - and 20 - point agreements of sarawak and sabah . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word allāh is always written without an alif to spell the ā vowel . this is because the spelling was settled before arabic spelling started habitually using alif to spell ā . however , in vocalized spelling , a small diacritic alif is added on top of the shaddah to indicate the pronunciation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the pre - islamic zabad inscription , cite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break god is referred to by the term الاله , that is , alif - lam - alif - lam - ha . this presumably indicates al - ' ilāh " the god " , without alif for ā . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many arabic type fonts feature special ligatures for allah . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since arabic script is used to write other texts rather than koran only , rendering lām lām hā’ as the previous ligature is considered faulty which is the case with most common arabic typefaces . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break unicode has a code point reserved for allāh , ufdf2 , in the arabic presentation forms - a block , which exists solely for " compatibility with some older , legacy character sets that encoded presentation forms directly " ; this is discouraged for new text . instead , the word allāh should be represented by its individual arabic letters , while modern font technologies will render the desired ligature . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the calligraphic variant of the word used as the coat of arms of iran is encoded in unicode , in the miscellaneous symbols range , at code point u262b ( ☫ ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break

day azerbaijan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the name azerbaijan was first adopted for the area of the present - day republic of azerbaijan by the government of musavat in 1918 , after the collapse of the russian empire , when the independent azerbaijan democratic republic was established . until then , the designation had been used exclusively to identify the adjacent region of contemporary northwestern iran , while the area of the azerbaijan democratic republic was formerly referred to as arran and shirvan . on that basis iran protested the newly adopted country name . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break during the soviet rule , the country was also spelled in latin from the russian transliteration as ' . the countrys name was also spelled in cyrillic script from 1940 to 1991 as азәрбајҹан . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earliest evidence of human settlement in the territory of azerbaijan dates back to the late stone age and is related to the guruchay culture of azykh cave . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break early settlements included the scythians during the 9th century bc . the area was conquered by the achaemenids leading to the spread of zoroastrianism . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the sasanian empire turned caucasian albania into a vassal state in 252 , while king urnayr officially adopted christianity as the state religion in the 4th century . despite sassanid rule , albania remained an entity in the region until the 9th century , while fully subordinate to sassanid iran , and retained its monarchy . despite being one of the chief vassals of the sasanian emperor , the albanian king had only a semblance of authority , and the sasanian marzban ( military governor ) held most civil , religious , and military authority . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the first half of the 7th century , caucasian albania , as a vassal of the sasanians , came under nominal muslim rule due to the muslim conquest of persia . the umayyad caliphate repulsed both the sasanians and byzantines from the south caucasus and turned caucasian albania into a vassal state after christian resistance led by king javanshir was suppressed in 667 . the power vacuum left by the decline of the abbasid caliphate was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the sallarids , sajids , and shaddadids . at the beginning of the 11th century , the territory was gradually seized by the waves of oghuz turks from central asia , who adopted a turkoman ethnonym at the time . the first of these turkic dynasties established was the seljuk empire , which entered the area now known as azerbaijan by 1067 . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the pre - turkic population that lived on the territory of modern azerbaijan spoke several indo - european and caucasian languages , among them armenian uvmr_ev_paragraph_break and an iranian language , old azeri , which was gradually replaced by a turkic language , the early precursor of the azerbaijani language of today . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break locally , the possessions of the subsequent seljuk empire were ruled by eldiguzids , technically vassals of the seljuk sultans , but sometimes de facto rulers themselves . under the seljuks , local poets such as nizami ganjavi and khaqani gave rise to a blossoming of persian literature on the territory of present - day azerbaijan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the local dynasty of the shirvanshahs became a vassal state of timurs empire and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the golden horde tokhtamysh . following timurs death , two independent and rival states emerged : kara koyunlu and aq qoyunlu . the shirvanshahs returned , maintaining for numerous centuries to come a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals as they had done since 861 . in 1501 , the safavid dynasty of iran subdued the shirvanshahs and gained its possessions . in the course of the next century , the safavids converted the formerly sunni population to shia islam , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break cite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as they did with the population in what is modern - day iran . the safavids allowed the shirvanshahs to remain in power , under safavid suzerainty , until 1538 , when safavid king tahmasp i ( r . 1524–1576 ) completely deposed them , and made the area into the safavid province of shirvan . the sunni ottomans briefly managed to occupy parts of present - day azerbaijan as a result of the ottoman - safavid war of 1578–1590 ; by the early 17th century , they were ousted by safavid iranian ruler abbas i ( r . in the wake of the demise of the safavid empire , baku and its environs were briefly occupied by the russians as a consequence of the russo - persian war of 1722–1723 . despite brief intermissions such as these by safavid irans neighboring rivals , the land of what is today azerbaijan remained under iranian rule from the earliest advent of the safavids up to the course of the 19th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after the safavids , the area was ruled by the iranian afsharid dynasty . after the death of nader shah ( r . 1736–1747 ) , many of his former subjects capitalized on the eruption of instability . numerous self - ruling khanates with various forms of autonomy uvmr_ev_paragraph_break emerged in the area . the rulers of these khanates were directly related to the ruling dynasties of iran and were vassals and subjects of the iranian shah . the khanates exercised control over their affairs via international trade routes between central asia and the west . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break thereafter , the area was under the successive rule of the iranian zands and qajars . from the late 18th century , imperial russia switched to a more aggressive geo - political stance towards its two neighbors and rivals to the south , namely iran and the ottoman empire . russia now actively tried to gain possession of the caucasus region which was , for the most part , in the hands of iran . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following qajar irans loss in the 1804–1813 war , it was forced to concede suzerainty over most of the khanates , along with georgia and dagestan to the russian empire , per the treaty of gulistan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the area to the north of the river aras , amongst which territory lies the contemporary republic of azerbaijan , was iranian territory until russia occupied it in the 19th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break about a decade later , in violation of the gulistan treaty , the russians invaded irans erivan khanate . this sparked the final bout of hostilities between the two , the russo - persian war of 1826–1828 . the resulting treaty of turkmenchay , forced qajar iran to cede sovereignty over the erivan khanate , the nakhchivan khanate and the remainder of the talysh khanate , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break qajar iran was forced to cede its caucasian territories to russia in the 19th century , which thus included the territory of the modern - day azerbaijan republic , while as a result of that cession , the azerbaijani ethnic group is nowadays parted between two nations : iran and azerbaijan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break despite the russian conquest , throughout the entire 19th century , preoccupation with iranian culture , literature , and language remained widespread amongst shia and sunni intellectuals in the russian -

karabakh war with the ethnic armenian majority of nagorno - karabakh backed by armenia . by the end of the hostilities in 1994 , armenians controlled up to 14–16 percent of azerbaijani territory , including nagorno - karabakh itself . during the war many atrocities and pogroms by both sides were committed including the massacres at malibeyli and gushchular , the garadaghly massacre and the khojaly massacres , along with the baku pogrom , the maraga massacre and the kirovabad pogrom . furthermore , an estimated 30000 people have been killed and more than a million people have been displaced , more than 800000 azerbaijanis and 300000 armenians . four united nations security council resolutions ( 822 , 853 , 874 , and 884 ) demand for " the immediate withdrawal of all armenian forces from all occupied territories of azerbaijan .

*********** Article 98: Amateur astronomy ***********

amateur astronomy is a hobby where participants enjoy observing or imaging celestial objects in the sky using the unaided eye , binoculars , or telescopes . even though scientific research may not be their primary goal , some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing citizen science , such as by monitoring variable stars , cite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amateur astronomers do not use the field of astronomy as their primary source of income or support , and usually have no professional degree in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject . most amateurs are hobbyists , while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist and work alongside professional astronomers . ite web uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amateur astronomers typically view the sky at night , when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible , but others observe during the daytime by viewing the sun and solar eclipses . some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or binoculars , but more dedicated amateurs often use portable telescopes or telescopes situated in their private or club observatories . amateurs can also join as members of amateur astronomical societies , which can advise , educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects . they can also promote the science of astronomy among the general public . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break collectively , amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena . common targets of amateur astronomers include the sun , the moon , planets , stars , comets , meteor showers , and a variety of deep sky objects such as star clusters , galaxies , and nebulae . many amateurs like to specialise in observing particular objects , types of objects , or types of events which interest them . one branch of amateur astronomy , amateur astrophotography , involves the taking of photos of the night sky . astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including , digital cameras , dslr cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built high quality ccd cameras . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most amateur astronomers work at visible wavelengths , but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum . an early pioneer of radio astronomy was grote reber , an amateur astronomer who constructed the first purpose built radio telescope in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of radio wavelength emissions from space by karl jansky . non - visual amateur astronomy includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes , and also the use of radio telescopes . some amateur astronomers use home - made radio telescopes , while others use radio telescopes that were originally built for astronomical research but have since been made available for use by amateurs . the one - mile telescope is one such example . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amateur astronomers use a range of instruments to study the sky , depending on a combination of their interests and resources . methods include simply looking at the night sky with the naked eye , using binoculars , and using a variety of optical telescopes of varying power and quality , as well as additional sophisticated equipment , such as cameras , to study light from the sky in both the visual and non - visual parts of the spectrum . commercial telescopes are available , new and used , but it is also common for amateur astronomers to build ( or commission the building of ) their own custom telescopes . some people even focus on amateur telescope making as their primary interest within the hobby of amateur astronomy . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break although specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over time , relatively simple equipment is often preferred for certain tasks . binoculars , for instance , although generally of lower power than the majority of telescopes , also tend to provide a wider field of view , which is preferable for looking at some objects in the night sky . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amateur astronomers also use star charts that , depending on experience and intentions , may range from simple planispheres through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night sky . a range of astronomy software is available and used by amateur astronomers , including software that generates maps of the sky , software to assist with astrophotography , observation scheduling software , and software to perform various calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amateur astronomers often like to keep records of their observations , which usually takes the form of an observing log . observing logs typically record details about which objects were observed and when , as well as describing the details that were seen . sketching is sometimes used within logs , and photographic records of observations have also been used in recent times . the information gathered is used to help studies and interactions between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings . although not professional information or credible , it is a way for the hobby lovers to share their new sightings and experiences . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the popularity of imaging among amateurs has led to large numbers of web sites being written by individuals about their images and equipment . much of the social interaction of amateur astronomy occurs on mailing lists or discussion groups . discussion group servers host numerous astronomy lists . a great deal of the commerce of amateur astronomy , the buying and selling of equipment , occurs online . many amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions , using tools such as the clear sky chart . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break while a number of interesting celestial objects are readily identified by the naked eye , sometimes with the aid of a star chart , many others are so faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them . although many methods are used in amateur astronomy , most are variations of a few specific techniques . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break star hopping is a method often used by amateur astronomers with low - tech equipment such as binoculars or a manually driven telescope . it involves the use of maps ( or memory ) to locate known landmark stars , and " hopping " between them , often with the aid of a finderscope . because of its simplicity , star hopping is a very common method for finding objects that are close to naked - eye stars . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break more advanced methods of locating objects in the sky include telescope mounts with setting circles , which assist with pointing telescopes to positions in the sky that are known to contain objects of interest , and goto telescopes , which are fully automated telescopes that are capable of locating objects on demand ( having first been calibrated ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the advent of mobile applications for use in smartphones has led to the creation of many dedicated apps . these apps allow any user to easily locate celestial objects of interest by simply pointing the smartphone device in that direction in the sky . these apps make use of the inbuilt hardware in the phone , such as gps location and gyroscope . useful information about the pointed object like celestial coordinates , the name of the object , its constellation , etcetera are provided for a quick reference . some paid versions give more information . these apps are gradually getting into regular use during observing , for the alignment process of telescopes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break setting circles are angular measurement scales that can be placed on the two main rotation axes of some telescopes . since the widespread adoption of digital setting circles , any classical engraved setting circle is now specifically identified as an " analog setting circle " ( asc ) . by knowing the coordinates of an object ( usually given in equatorial coordinates ) , the telescope user can use the setting circle to align ( that is , point ) the telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its eyepiece . a computerized setting circle is called a " digital setting circle " ( dsc ) . although digital setting circles can be used to display a telescopes ra and dec coordinates , they are not simply a digital read - out of what can be seen on the telescopes analog setting circles . as with go - to telescopes , digital setting circle computers ( commercial names include argo navis , sky commander , and ngc max ) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial objects and projections of planet positions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to find a celestial object in a telescope equipped with a dsc computer , one does not need to look up the specific ra and dec coordinates in a book or other resource , and then adjust the telescope to those numerical readings . rather , the object is chosen from the electronic database , which causes distance values and arrow markers to appear in the display that indicate the distance and direction to move the telescope . the telescope is moved until the two angular distance values reach zero , indicating that the telescope is properly aligned . when both the ra and dec axes are thus " zeroed out " , the object should be in the eyepiece . many dscs , like go - to systems , can also work in conjunction with laptop sky programs uvmr_ev_paragraph_break computerized systems provide the further advantage of computing coordinate precession . traditional printed sources are subtitled by the epoch year , which refers to the positions of celestial objects at a given time to the nearest year ( for example , j2005 , j2007 ) . most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years ( for example , j1900 , j1950 , j2000 ) . computerized sources , on the other hand , are able to calculate the right ascension and declination of the " epoch of date " to the exact instant of observation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break goto telescopes have become more popular since the 1980s as technology has improved and prices have been reduced . with these computer - driven telescopes , the user typically enters the name of the item of interest and the mechanics of the telescope point the telescope towards that item automatically . they have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on research . for example , goto telescopes tend to be faster for locating items of interest than star hopping , allowing more time for studying of the object . goto also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt - azimuth telescope mounts , allowing them to produce an overall less expensive product . goto telescopes usually have to be calibrated using alignment stars in order to provide accurate tracking and positioning . however , several telescope manufacturers have recently developed telescope systems that are calibrated with the use of built - in gps , decreasing the time it takes to set up a telescope at the start of an observing session . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with the development of fast internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in computer controlled telescope mounts and ccd cameras " remote telescope " astronomy is now a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with major telescope facilities to partake in research and deep sky imaging . this enables anyone to control a telescope a great distance away in a dark location . the observer can image through the telescope using ccd cameras . the digital data collected by the telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the user by means of the internet . an example of a digital remote telescope operation for public use via the internet is the bareket observatory , and there are telescope farms in new mexico , australia and atacama in chile . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including film , dslr , lrgb , and ccd astrophotography . because ccd imagers are linear , image processing may be used to subtract away the effects of light pollution , which has increased the popularity of astrophotography in urban areas . narrowband filters may also be used to minimize light pollution . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break scientific research is most often not the main goal for many amateur astronomers , unlike professional astronomers . work of scientific merit is possible , however , and many amateurs successfully contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers . astronomy is sometimes promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data . to recognize this , the astronomical society of the pacific annually gives amateur achievement awards for significant contributions to astronomy by amateurs . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection . in particular , this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers . several organizations , such as the american association of variable star observers and the british astronomical association , exist to help coordinate these contributions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break amateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of variable stars and supernovae , helping to track asteroids , and observing occultations to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the moon as seen from earth . with more advanced equipment , but still cheap in comparison to professional setups , amateur astronomers can measure the light spectrum emitted from astronomical objects , which can yield high - quality scientific data if the measurements are performed with due care . a relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked phenomena ( for example , kreutz sungrazers ) in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by earth and space based observatories , much of which is available over the internet . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the past and present , amateur astronomers have played a major role in discovering new comets . recently however , funding of projects such as the lincoln near - earth asteroid research and near earth asteroid tracking projects has meant that most comets are now discovered by automated systems long before it is possible for amateurs to see them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there are a large number of amateur astronomical societies around the world , that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy . members range from active observers with their own equipment to " armchair astronomers " who are simply interested in the topic . societies range widely in their goals and activities , which may depend on a variety of factors such as geographic spread , local circumstances , size , and membership . for example , a small local society located in dark countryside may focus on practical observing and star parties , whereas a large one based in a major city might have numerous members but be limited by light pollution and thus hold regular indoor meetings with guest speakers instead . major national or international societies generally publish their own journal or newsletter , and some hold large multi - day meetings akin to a scientific conference or convention . they may also have sections devoted to particular topics , such as lunar observation or amateur telescope making . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 99: Aikido ***********

aikido ( 合気道 , 合氣道 , aikidō , ) is a modern japanese martial art that is split into many different styles , including iwama ryu , iwama shin shin aiki shuren kai , shodokan aikido , yoshinkan , renshinkai , aikikai and ki aikido . aikido is now practiced in around 140 countries . it was originally developed by morihei ueshiba , as a synthesis of his martial studies , philosophy and religious beliefs . ueshibas goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attackers from injury . aikido is often translated as " the way of unifying ( with ) life energy " cite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aikidos fundamental principles include : irimi ( entering ) , atemi , kokyu - ho ( breathing control ) , sankaku - ho ( triangular principle ) and tenkan ( turning ) movements that redirect the opponents attack momentum . its curriculum comprises various techniques , primarily throws and joint locks . ite encyclopedia uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aikido derives mainly from the martial art of daitō - ryū aiki - jūjutsu , but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s , partly due to ueshibas involvement with the ōmoto - kyō religion . ueshibas early students ' documents bear the term aiki - jūjutsu . ite encyclopedia uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ueshibas senior students have different approaches to aikido , depending partly on when they studied with him . today , aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles , with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis . however , they all share techniques formulated by ueshiba and most have concern for the well - being of the attacker . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the word " aikido " is formed of three kanji : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term aiki does not readily appear in the japanese language outside the scope of budō . this has led to many possible interpretations of the word . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 合 ( ai ) is mainly used in compounds to mean ' combine , unite , join together , meet ' , examples being 合同 ( combined / united ) , 合成 ( composition ) , 結合 ( unite / combine / join together ) , 連合 ( union / alliance / association ) , 統合 ( combine / unify ) , and 合意 ( mutual agreement ) . there is an idea of reciprocity , 知り合う ( to get to know one another ) , 話し合い ( talk / discussion / negotiation ) , and 待ち合わせる ( meet by appointment ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 気 ( ki ) is often used to describe a feeling or emotive action , as in x気がする ( ' i feel x ' , as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning ) , and 気持ち ( feeling / sensation ) ; it is used to mean energy or force , as in 電気 ( electricity ) and 磁気 ( magnetism ) ; it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things , as in 気質 ( spirit / trait / temperament ) . the characters aeteological history can be traced back to the much older chinese character of qi ( 氣 ) that is used extensively in traditional chinese medicine and acupunture . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the term dō in aikido is found in many other japanese martial arts such as , judo and kendo , and in various non - martial arts , such as japanese calligraphy ( shodō ) , flower arranging ( kadō ) and tea ceremony ( chadō or sadō ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break therefore , from a purely literal interpretation , aikido is the " way of combining forces " or " way of unifying energy " , in which the term aiki refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attackers movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort . ite encyclopedia uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aikido was created by ( 1883–1969 ) , referred to by some aikido practitioners as ōsensei ( great teacher ) . ite encyclopedia uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ueshiba developed aikido primarily during the late 1920s through the 1930s through the synthesis of the older martial arts that he had studied . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the art of daitō - ryū is the primary technical influence on aikido . along with empty - handed throwing and joint - locking techniques , ueshiba incorporated training movements with weapons , such as those for the spear ( yari ) , short staff ( jō ) , and possibly the . aikido also derives much of its technical structure from the art of swordsmanship ( kenjutsu ) . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ueshiba moved to hokkaidō in 1912 , and began studying under takeda sokaku in 1915 ; his official association with daitō - ryū continued until 1937 . however , during the latter part of that period , ueshiba had already begun to distance himself from takeda and the daitō - ryū . at that time ueshiba referred to his martial art as " aiki budō " . it is unclear exactly when ueshiba began using the name " aikido " , but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the greater japan martial virtue society ( dai nippon butoku kai ) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of japanese martial arts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after ueshiba left hokkaidō in 1919 , he met and was profoundly influenced by onisaburo deguchi , the spiritual leader of the ōmoto - kyō religion ( a neo - shinto movement ) in ayabe . ite encyclopedia uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in addition to the effect on his spiritual growth , the connection with deguchi gave ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist . as a result of this exposure , he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students . several of these students would found their own styles of aikido . ite journal uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aikido was first introduced to the rest of the world in 1951 by minoru mochizuki with a visit to france , where he demonstrated aikido techniques to judo students . ite encyclopedia uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the largest aikido organization is the aikikai foundation , which remains under the control of the ueshiba family . however , aikido has developed into many styles , most of which were formed by morihei ueshibas major students . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the earliest independent styles to emerge were yoseikan aikido , begun by minoru mochizuki in 1931 , yoshinkan aikido , founded by gozo shioda in 1955 , cite encyclopedia uvmr_ev_paragraph_break after ueshibas death in 1969 , two more major styles emerged . significant controversy arose with the departure of the aikikai hombu dojos chief instructor koichi tohei , in 1974 . tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder , kisshomaru ueshiba , who at that time headed the aikikai foundation . the disagreement was over the proper role of ki development in regular aikido training . after tohei left , he formed his own style , called shin shin toitsu aikido , and the organization that governs it , the ki society ( ki no kenkyūkai ) . ite encyclopedia uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a final major style evolved from ueshibas retirement in iwama , ibaraki and the teaching methodology of long term student morihiro saito . it is unofficially referred to as the " iwama style " , and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called iwama ryu . although iwama style practitioners remained part of the aikikai until saitos death in 2002 , followers of saito subsequently split into two groups . one remained with the aikikai and the other formed the independent shinshin aikishuren kai in 2004 around saitos son hitohiro saito . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break today , the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization , have their own in japan , and are taught throughout the world . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the study of ki is an important component of aikido . the term does not specifically refer to either physical or mental training , as it encompasses both . the kanji for ki was written in its older form as 氣 up until the japanese governmental writing reforms after world war ii , and now is more prevalently seen in its modern form of 気 . this form has the removal of the eight directions denoting the pre and post natal energies of ( chinese – yuán qì ) also known in the art of aikido as " source energy " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the character for ki is used in everyday japanese terms , such as , or . ki has many meanings , including " ambience " , " mind " , " mood " , or " intention and action " , however , in traditional martial arts and medicine it is often referred to in its more general terminology as " life energy " . gozo shiodas yoshinkan aikido , considered one of the " hard styles " , largely follows ueshibas teachings from before world war ii , and surmises that the secret to ki lies in timing and the application of the whole bodys strength to a single point . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in aikido , as in virtually all japanese martial arts , there are both physical and mental aspects of training . the physical training in aikido is diverse , covering both general physical fitness and conditioning , as well as specific techniques . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation , correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders , flexibility , and endurance , with less emphasis on strength training . in aikido , pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements . this distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in aikido , specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone , mass , or power . aikido - related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole - body movement and balance similar to yoga or pilates . for example , many dōjōs begin each class with , which may include stretching and ukemi ( break falls ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre - arranged forms ( kata ) rather than freestyle practice . the basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique ( uke ) to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique—the , or ( depending on aikido style ) , also referred to as ( when applying a throwing technique ) , who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break both halves of the technique , that of uke and that of tori , are considered essential to aikido training . both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation . tori learns to blend with and control attacking energy , while uke learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous , off - balance positions in which tori places them . this " receiving " of the technique is called ukemi . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break refers to the act of receiving a technique . good ukemi involves attention to the technique , the partner , and the immediate environment—it is considered an active part of the process of learning aikido . the method of falling itself is also important , and is a way for the practitioner to receive an aikido technique safely and minimize risk of injury . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack , so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner . although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking - based arts , attacks with intent ( such as a strong strike or an immobilizing grab ) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many of the of aikido resemble cuts from a sword or other grasped object , which indicate its origins in techniques intended for armed combat . other techniques , which explicitly appear to be punches ( tsuki ) , are practiced as thrusts with a knife or sword . kicks are generally reserved for upper - level variations ; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous , and that kicks ( high kicks in particular ) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal japan . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break some basic strikes include : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs , both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and the direction of the movement of force of a hold than it is for a strike . some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon , whereupon a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker while they are grabbing the defender . the following are examples of some basic grabs : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the following are a sample of the basic or widely practiced throws and pins . many of these techniques derive from daitō - ryū aiki - jūjutsu , but some others were invented by morihei ueshiba . the precise terminology for some may vary between organisations and styles ; the following are the terms used by the aikikai foundation . note that despite the names of the first five techniques listed , they are not universally taught in numeric order . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aikido makes use of body movement ( tai sabaki ) to blend the movement of tori with the movement of uke . for example , an " entering " ( irimi ) technique consists of movements inward towards uke , while a technique uses a pivoting motion . ite journal uvmr_ev_paragraph_break additionally , an technique takes place in front of uke , whereas an technique takes place to their side ; a technique is applied with motion to the front of uke , and a version is applied with motion towards the rear of uke , usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion . finally , most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture ( seiza ) . techniques where both and tori are standing are called tachi - waza , techniques where both start off in seiza are called suwari - waza , and techniques performed with uke standing and tori sitting are called hanmi handachi ( 半身半立 ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break from these few basic techniques , there are numerous of possible implementations . for example , ikkyō can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike ( perhaps with an ura type of movement to redirect the incoming force ) , or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance ( perhaps an omote - waza version ) . specific aikido kata are typically referred to with the formula " attack - technique ( - modifier ) " ; katate - dori ikkyō , for example , refers to any ikkyō technique executed when uke is holding one wrist . this could be further specified as katate - dori ikkyō omote ( referring to any forward - moving ikkyō technique from that grab ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break are strikes ( or feints ) employed during an aikido technique . some view atemi as attacks against " vital points " meant to cause damage in and of themselves . for instance , gozo shioda described using atemi in a brawl to quickly down a gangs leader . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break weapons training in aikido traditionally includes the short staff ( jō ) ( these techniques closely resemble the use of the bayonet , or jūkendō ) , the wooden sword ( bokken ) , and the knife ( tantō ) . ite book last dang uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the founder developed many of the empty - handed techniques from traditional sword , spear and bayonet movements . consequently , the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements , and reinforces the concepts of distance , timing , foot movement , presence and connectedness with ones training partner ( s ) . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break one feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers , often called taninzudori , or taninzugake . freestyle practice with multiple attackers called is a key part of most curricula and is required for the higher - level ranks . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in shodokan aikido , randori differs in that it is not performed with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker , but between two people , where both participants attack , defend , and counter at will . in this respect it resembles judo randori . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in applying a technique during training , it is the responsibility of tori to prevent injury to uke by employing a speed and force of application that is appropriate with their partners proficiency in ukemi . ite encyclopedia uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a study of injuries in the martial arts showed that the type of injuries varied considerably from one art to the other . ite journal uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aikido training is mental as well as physical , emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations . ite book uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aikido practitioners ( commonly called aikidōka outside japan ) generally progress by promotion through a series of " grades " ( kyū ) , followed by a series of " degrees " ( dan ) , pursuant to formal testing procedures . some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners ' grades , often simply white and black belts to distinguish kyu and dan grades , although some use various belt colors . testing requirements vary , so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another . some dōjōs have an age requirement before students can take the dan rank exam . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the uniform worn for practicing aikido ( aikidōgi ) is similar to the training uniform ( keikogi ) used in most other modern martial arts ; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket , usually white . both thick ( " judo - style " ) , and thin ( " karate - style " ) cotton tops are used . aikido - specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most aikido systems add a pair of wide pleated black or indigo trousers known as hakama ( used also in naginatajutsu , kendo , and iaido ) . in many schools , the wearing of hakama is reserved for practitioners with dan ranks or for instructors , while others allow all practitioners to wear a hakama regardless of rank . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break aikido styles vary in their intention as due to its holistic nature . the most common differences noted in aikido , when observed externally , relate to the intensity and realism of training . stanley pranin has observed that some criticism may stem from weak attacks from uke , allowing for a conditioned response from tori , resulting in underdevelopment of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break to counteract this , some styles allow students to become less compliant over time , but , in keeping with the core philosophies , this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners . shodokan aikido addresses the issue by practicing in a competitive format . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break reasons for the difference and diversity of teachings , intention , and forms of aikido can be traced to the shift in training focus after the end of ueshibas seclusion in iwama from 1942 to the mid - 1950s , as he increasingly emphasized the spiritual and philosophical aspects of aikido . as a result , strikes to vital points by tori , entering ( irimi ) and initiation of techniques by tori , the distinction between omote ( front side ) and ura ( back side ) techniques , and the use of weapons , were all de - emphasized or eliminated from practice . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break conversely , some styles of aikido place less importance on the spiritual practices emphasized by ueshiba . according to minoru shibata of aikido journal : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break o - senseis aikido was not a continuation and extension of the old and has a distinct discontinuity with past martial and philosophical concepts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in other words , aikido practitioners who focus on aikidos roots in traditional jujutsu or kenjutsu are said to be diverging from what ueshiba taught , as some critics urge practitioners : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break ueshibas transcendence to the spiritual and universal reality were the fundamentals of the paradigm that he demonstrated . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break 




*********** Article 100: Art ***********

art is a diverse range of human activity , and resulting product , that involves creative or imaginative talent expressive of technical proficiency , beauty , emotional power , or conceptual ideas . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there is no generally agreed definition of what constitutes art , and its interpretation has varied greatly throughout history and across cultures . the three classical branches of visual art are painting , sculpture , and architecture . theatre , dance , and other performing arts , as well as literature , music , film and other media such as interactive media , are included in a broader definition of the arts . until the 17th century , art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences . in modern usage after the 17th century , where aesthetic considerations are paramount , the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general , such as the decorative or applied arts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the nature of art and related concepts , such as creativity and interpretation , are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics . the resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the perspective of the history of art , artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind : from early pre - historic art to contemporary art ; however , some theorists think that the typical concept of " artistic works " doesnt fit well outside modern western societies . one early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older latin meaning , which roughly translates to " skill " or " craft " , as associated with words such as " artisan " . english words derived from this meaning include artifact , artificial , artifice , medical arts , and military arts . however , there are many other colloquial uses of the word , all with some relation to its etymology . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break over time , philosophers like plato , aristotle , socrates and kant , among others , questioned the meaning of art . several dialogues in plato tackle questions about art : socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses , and is not rational . he speaks approvingly of this , and other forms of divine madness ( drunkenness , eroticism , and dreaming ) in the phaedrus ( 265a–c ) , and yet in the ' republic ' wants to outlaw homers great poetic art , and laughter as well . in ion , socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of homer that he expresses in the republic . the dialogue ion suggests that homers iliad functioned in the ancient greek world as the bible does today in the modern christian world : as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance , if only it can be properly interpreted . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break with regards to the literary art and the musical arts , aristotle considered epic poetry , tragedy , comedy , dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art , each varying in imitation by medium , object , and manner . for example , music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony , whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone , and poetry with language . the forms also differ in their object of imitation . comedy , for instance , is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average ; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average . lastly , the forms differ in their manner of imitation—through narrative or character , through change or no change , and through drama or no drama . aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankinds advantages over animals . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the more recent and specific sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early 17th century . fine art refers to a skill used to express the artists creativity , or to engage the audiences aesthetic sensibilities , or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer work of art . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break within this latter sense , the word art may refer to several things : ( i ) a study of a creative skill , ( ii ) a process of using the creative skill , ( iii ) a product of the creative skill , or ( iv ) the audiences experience with the creative skill . the creative arts ( art as discipline ) are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks ( art as objects ) that are compelled by a personal drive ( art as activity ) and convey a message , mood , or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret ( art as experience ) . art is something that stimulates an individuals thoughts , emotions , beliefs , or ideas through the senses . works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects . for some scholars , such as kant , the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break often , if the skill is being used in a common or practical way , people will consider it a craft instead of art . likewise , if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way , it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art . on the other hand , crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art . some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference . however , even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self - expression . the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas , such as in politically , spiritually , or philosophically motivated art ; to create a sense of beauty ( see aesthetics ) ; to explore the nature of perception ; for pleasure ; or to generate strong emotions . the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the nature of art has been described by philosopher richard wollheim as " one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture " . art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas , a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake , and as mimesis or representation . art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of aristotle . benedetto croce and collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions , and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator . the theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of kant , and was developed in the early 20th century by roger fry and clive bell . more recently , thinkers influenced by martin heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self - expression and interpretation . george dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as " the art world " has conferred " the status of candidate for appreciation " . larry shiner has described fine art as " not an essence or a fate but something we have made . art as we have generally understood it is a european invention barely two hundred years old . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break art may be characterized in terms of mimesis ( its representation of reality ) , narrative ( storytelling ) , expression , communication of emotion , or other qualities . during the romantic period , art came to be seen as " a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a shell engraved by homo erectus was determined to be between 430000 and 540000 years old . a set of eight 130000 years old white - tailed eagle talons bear cut marks and abrasion that indicate manipulation by neanderthals , possibly for using it as jewelry . a series of tiny , drilled snail shells about 75000 years old—were discovered in a south african cave . containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as 100000 years . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break sculptures , cave paintings , rock paintings and petroglyphs from the upper paleolithic dating to roughly 40000 years ago have been found , but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations : ancient egypt , mesopotamia , persia , india , china , ancient greece , rome , as well as inca , maya , and olmec . each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art . because of the size and duration of these civilizations , more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times . some also have provided the first records of how artists worked . for example , this period of greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature , poise , beauty , and anatomically correct proportions . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in byzantine and medieval art of the western middle ages , much art focused on the expression of subjects about biblical and religious culture , and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world , such as the use of gold in the background of paintings , or glass in mosaics or windows , which also presented figures in idealized , patterned ( flat ) forms nevertheless , a classical realist tradition persisted in small byzantine works , and realism steadily grew in the art of catholic europe . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world , and the place of humans in it , reflected in the corporeality of the human body , and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three - dimensional picture space . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the east , islamic arts rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns , calligraphy , and architecture . further east , religion dominated artistic styles and forms too . india and tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance , while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines . china saw the flourishing of many art forms : jade carving , bronzework , pottery ( including the stunning terracotta army of emperor qin ) , poetry , calligraphy , music , painting , drama , fiction , etcetera chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty . so , for example , tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse , emphasizing idealized landscapes , but ming dynasty paintings are busy and colorful , and focus on telling stories via setting and composition . japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too , and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting . woodblock printing became important in japan after the 17th century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the western age of enlightenment in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe , as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post - monarchist world , such as blakes portrayal of newton as a divine geometer , or davids propagandistic paintings . this led to romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans , exemplified in the novels of goethe . the late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements , such as academic art , symbolism , impressionism and fauvism among others . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the history of 20th - century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards , each being torn down in succession by the next . thus the parameters of impressionism , expressionism , fauvism , cubism , dadaism , surrealism , etcetera cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention . increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into western art . thus , japanese woodblock prints ( themselves influenced by western renaissance draftsmanship ) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development . later , african sculptures were taken up by picasso and to some extent by matisse . similarly , in the 19th and 20th centuries the west has had huge impacts on eastern art with originally western ideas like communism and post - modernism exerting a powerful influence . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break modernism , the idealistic search for truth , gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability . theodor adorno said in 1970 , " it is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more : neither art itself , nor art in relationship to the whole , nor even the right of art to exist . " relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth , which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism , where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms , which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony . furthermore , the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture , rather than of regional ones . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the origin of the work of art , martin heidegger , a german philosopher and a seminal thinker , describes the essence of art in terms of the concepts of being and truth . he argues that art is not only a way of expressing the element of truth in a culture , but the means of creating it and providing a springboard from which " that which is " can be revealed . works of art are not merely representations of the way things are , but actually produce a communitys shared understanding . each time a new artwork is added to any culture , the meaning of what it is to exist is inherently changed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break historically , art and artistic skills and ideas have often been spread through trade . an example of this is the silk road , where hellenistic , iranian , indian and chinese influences could mix . greco buddhist art is one of the most vivid examples of this interaction . the meeting of different cultures and worldviews also influenced artistic creation . an example of this is the multicultural port metropolis of trieste at the beginning of the 20th century , where james joyce met writers from central europe and the artistic development of new york city as a cultural melting pot . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the creative arts are often divided into more specific categories , typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as media , genre , styles , and form . art form refers to the elements of art that are independent of its interpretation or significance . it covers the methods adopted by the artist and the physical composition of the artwork , primarily non - semantic aspects of the work ( that is , figurae ) , such as color , contour , dimension , medium , melody , space , texture , and value . form may also include visual design principles , such as arrangement , balance , contrast , emphasis , harmony , proportion , proximity , and rhythm . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in general there are three schools of philosophy regarding art , focusing respectively on form , content , and context . unfortunately , there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties . some authors refer to subject matter and content – that is , denotations and connotations – while others prefer terms like meaning and significance . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break extreme intentionalism holds that authorial intent plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art , conveying the content or essential main idea , while all other interpretations can be discarded . it defines the subject as the persons or idea represented , and the content as the artists experience of that subject . for example , the composition of napoleon i on his imperial throne is partly borrowed from the statue of zeus at olympia . as evidenced by the title , the subject is napoleon , and the content is ingress representation of napoleon as " emperor - god beyond time and space " . similarly to extreme formalism , philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism , because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant . its restrictive interpretation is " socially unhealthy , philosophically unreal , and politically unwise " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break finally , the developing theory of post - structuralism studies arts significance in a cultural context , such as the ideas , emotions , and reactions prompted by a work . the cultural context often reduces to the artists techniques and intentions , in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism . however , in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate , such as religious and philosophical convictions , sociopolitical and economic structures , or even climate and geography . art criticism continues to grow and develop alongside art . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium . art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy or depth . art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings , thoughts , and observations . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it , which facilitates ones thought processes . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a common view is that the epithet " art " , particular in its elevated sense , requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist , whether this be a demonstration of technical ability , an originality in stylistic approach , or a combination of these two . traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success ; for leonardo da vinci , art , neither more nor less than his other endeavors , was a manifestation of skill . rembrandts work , now praised for its ephemeral virtues , was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity . at the turn of the 20th century , the adroit performances of john singer sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency , yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the eras most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast , pablo picasso , was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break a common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object . in conceptual art , marcel duchamps " fountain " is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ( " ready - made " ) and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills . tracey emins my bed , or damien hirsts the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living follow this example and also manipulate the mass media . emin slept ( and engaged in other activities ) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art . hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans . hirsts celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts . the actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects . however , there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands - on works of art . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history , making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept . this does not imply that the purpose of art is " vague " , but that it has had many unique , different reasons for being created . some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline . the different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non - motivated , and those that are motivated ( lévi - strauss ) . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the non - motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human , transcend the individual , or do not fulfill a specific external purpose . in this sense , art , as creativity , is something humans must do by their very nature ( that is , no other species creates art ) , and is therefore beyond utility . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break motivated purposes of art refer to intentional , conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator . these may be to bring about political change , to comment on an aspect of society , to convey a specific emotion or mood , to address personal psychology , to illustrate another discipline , to ( with commercial arts ) sell a product , or simply as a form of communication . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive , as many of them may overlap . for example , art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product , that is the movie or video game . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break since ancient times , much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power , often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials . much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments , with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break nevertheless , there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available , in terms of ownership , across large parts of society , above all in cheap media such as pottery , which persists in the ground , and perishable media such as textiles and wood . in many different cultures , the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the americas are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a social elite , though other forms of art may have been . reproductive methods such as moulds made mass - production easier , and were used to bring high - quality ancient roman pottery and greek tanagra figurines to a very wide market . cylinder seals were both artistic and practical , and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the ancient near east . once coins were widely used , these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break another important innovation came in the 15th century in europe , when printmaking began with small woodcuts , mostly religious , that were often very small and hand - colored , and affordable even by peasants who glued them to the walls of their homes . printed books were initially very expensive , but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations . popular prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1661 , the city of basel , in switzerland , opened the first public museum of art in the world , the kunstmuseum basel . today , its collection is distinguished by an impressively wide historic span , from the early 15th century up to the immediate present . its various areas of emphasis give it international standing as one of the most significant museums of its kind . these encompass : paintings and drawings by artists active in the upper rhine region between 1400 and 1600 , and on the art of the 19th to 21st centuries . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break public buildings and monuments , secular and religious , by their nature normally address the whole of society , and visitors as viewers , and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design . egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public , rather than the areas seen only by the priests . many areas of royal palaces , castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible , and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen , either by anybody , or by those able to pay a small price , or those wearing the correct clothes , regardless of who they were , as at the palace of versailles , where the appropriate extra accessories ( silver shoe buckles and a sword ) could be hired from shops outside . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries , as with the orleans collection mostly housed in a wing of the palais royal in paris , which could be visited for most of the 18th century . in italy the art tourism of the grand tour became a major industry from the renaissance onwards , and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible . the british royal collection remains distinct , but large donations such as the old royal library were made from it to the british museum , established in 1753 . the uffizi in florence opened entirely as a gallery in 1765 , though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants ' offices for a long time before . the building now occupied by the prado in madrid was built before the french revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection , and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in vienna , munich and other capitals . the opening of the musée du louvre during the french revolution ( in 1793 ) as a public museum for much of the former french royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art , transferring ownership to a republican state , but was a continuation of trends already well established . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone . however , museums do not only provide availability to art , but do also influence the way art is being perceived by the audience , as studies found . thus , the museum itself is not only a blunt stage for the presentation of art , but plays an active and vital role in the overall perception of art in modern society . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break museums in the united states tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses . ( the metropolitan museum of art in new york city , for example , was created by john taylor johnston , a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum . but despite all this , at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break there have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object . one of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold . it is " necessary to present something more than mere objects " said the major post war german artist joseph beuys . this time period saw the rise of such things as performance art , video art , and conceptual art . the idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind , or was simply an idea , it could not be bought and sold . " democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid - 1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s . artists broadly identified under the heading of conceptual art substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form have endeavored to undermine the art object qua object . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break art has long been controversial , that is to say disliked by some viewers , for a wide variety of reasons , though most pre - modern controversies are dimly recorded , or completely lost to a modern view . iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons , including religious ones . aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images , or often just religious ones , and has been a thread in many major religions . it has been a crucial factor in the history of islamic art , where depictions of muhammad remain especially controversial . much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers , parties or other groups . artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics , though often much less so by a wider public . the iconographic content of art could cause controversy , as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the swoon of the virgin in scenes of the crucifixion of jesus . the last judgment by michelangelo was controversial for various reasons , including breaches of decorum through nudity and the apollo - like pose of christ . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist , but with the advent of romanticism , and economic changes in the production of art , the artists ' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art , increasing the incidence of controversies , though often reducing their significance . strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy . théodore géricaults raft of the medusa ( c . 1820 ) , was in part a political commentary on a recent event . édouard manets le déjeuner sur lherbe ( 1863 ) , was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman , but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time , rather than in robes of the antique world . john singer sargents madame pierre gautreau ( madamx ) ( 1884 ) , caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the womans ear lobe , considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high - society models reputation . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in the 20th century , pablo picassos guernica ( 1937 ) used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils , to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small , ancient basque town . leon golubs interrogation iii ( 1981 ) , depicts a female nude , hooded detainee strapped to a chair , her legs open to reveal her sexual organs , surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing . andres serranos piss christ ( 1989 ) is a photograph of a crucifix , sacred to the christian religion and representing christs sacrifice and final suffering , submerged in a glass of the artists own urine . the resulting uproar led to comments in the united states senate about public funding of the arts . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break before modernism , aesthetics in western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of realism or truth to nature and the ideal ; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries . this concern is largely absent in other traditions of art . the aesthetic theorist john ruskin , who championed what he saw as the naturalism of turner , saw arts role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century . richard wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art : the realist , whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view ; the objectivist , whereby it is also an absolute value , but is dependent on general human experience ; and the relativist position , whereby it is not an absolute value , but depends on , and varies with , the human experience of different humans . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the arrival of modernism in the late 19th century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art , and then again in the late 20th century with the advent of postmodernism . clement greenbergs 1960 article " modernist painting " defines modern art as " the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself " . greenberg originally applied this idea to the abstract expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat ( non - illusionistic ) abstract painting : uvmr_ev_paragraph_break quoterealistic , naturalistic art had dissembled the medium , using art to conceal art ; modernism used art to call attention to art . the limitations that constitute the medium of painting—the flat surface , the shape of the support , the properties of the pigment—were treated by the old masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly . under modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors , and were acknowledged openly . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break pop artists like andy warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture , as well as the art world . artists of the 1980s , 1990s , and 2000s expanded this technique of self - criticism beyond high art to all cultural image - making , including fashion images , comics , billboards and pornography . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind - everything . however , the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction . there is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this . in the invention of art : a cultural history , larry shiner examines the construction of the modern system of the arts , that is fine art . he finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system ( fine art ) held art to be any skilled human activity ; for example , ancient greek society did not possess the term art , but techne . techne can be understood neither as art or craft , the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history . techne included painting , sculpting and music , but also cooking , medicine , horsemanship , geometry , carpentry , prophecy , and farming , etcetera uvmr_ev_paragraph_break following duchamp during the first half of the 20th century , a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art , including the literary arts and the visual arts , to each other . this resulted in the rise of the new criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy . at issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art , whatever its specific form , should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art , or , if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in 1946 , william wimsatt and monroe beardsley published a classic and controversial new critical essay entitled " the intentional fallacy " , in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an authors intention , or " intended meaning " in the analysis of a literary work . for wimsatt and beardsley , the words on the page were all that mattered ; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant , and potentially distracting . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break in another essay , " the affective fallacy " , which served as a kind of sister essay to " the intentional fallacy " wimsatt and beardsley also discounted the readers personal / emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text . this fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader - response school of literary theory . ironically , one of the leading theorists from this school , stanley fish , was himself trained by new critics . fish criticizes wimsatt and beardsley in his 1970 essay " literature in the reader " . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break as summarized by gaut and livingston in their essay " the creation of art " : " structuralist and post - structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of new criticism , beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so - called autonomy of art , but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms ' assumption that the artists activities and experience were a privileged critical topic . " these authors contend that : " anti - intentionalists , such as formalists , hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art . so details of the act of creating a work , though possibly of interest in themselves , have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break gaut and livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that : " intentionalists , unlike formalists , hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works . " they quote richard wollheim as stating that , " the task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process , where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of , but terminating on , the work of art itself . " uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy , or the " innocent eye debate " in the philosophy of art . this debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition , namely the structuralism of ferdinand de saussure and the ensuing movement of poststructuralism . in 1981 , the artist mark tansey created a work of art titled " the innocent eye " as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century . influential theorists include judith butler , luce irigaray , julia kristeva , michel foucault and jacques derrida . the power of language , more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes , in art history and historical discourse was explored by hayden white . the fact that language is not a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of philosophy of language which originated in the works of johann georg hamann and wilhelm von humboldt . ernst gombrich and nelson goodman in his book languages of art : an approach to a theory of symbols came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s . he was challenged on the basis of research done by the nobel prize winning psychologist roger sperry who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone ( the linguistic turn ) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable . sperrys view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as nick zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break anti - art is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art ; when he was making art from found objects . the lo - fi mail art movement , and the young british artists , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break architecture is often included as one of the visual arts ; however , like the decorative arts , or advertising , it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting , for example . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break somewhat in relation to the above , the word art is also used to apply judgments of value , as in such expressions as " that meal was a work of art " ( the cook is an artist ) , or " the art of deception " ( the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised ) . it is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity . making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism . at the simplest level , a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive . though perception is always colored by experience , and is necessarily subjective , it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art . however , " good " art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers . in other words , an artists prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic . also , art often depicts terrible images made for social , moral , or thought - provoking reasons . for example , francisco goyas painting depicting the spanish shootings of 3 may 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians . yet at the same time , the horrific imagery demonstrates goyas keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage . thus , the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction , if any , is required to define ' art ' . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing . indeed , the reverse is often true , that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re - invigoration of aesthetic sensibility , and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself . countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality , yet they all seem to agree in at least one point : once their aesthetic choices are accepted , the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist . art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion . it can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings , and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings . artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent , but they do not have to do so consciously . art may be considered an exploration of the human condition ; that is , what it is to be human . by extension , it has been argued by emily spratt that the development of artificial intelligence , especially in regard to its uses with images , necessitates a re - evaluation of aesthetic theory in art history today and a reconsideration of the limits of human creativity . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break an essential legal issue are art forgeries , plagiarism , replicas and works that are strongly based on other works of art . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break the trade in works of art or the export from a country may be subject to legal regulations . internationally there are also extensive efforts to protect the works of art created . the un , unesco and blue shield international try to ensure effective protection at the national level and to intervene directly in the event of armed conflicts or disasters . this can particularly affect museums , archives , uvmr_ev_paragraph_break art collections and excavation sites . this should also secure the economic basis of a country , especially because works of art are often of tourist importance . the founding president of blue shield international , karl von habsburg , explained an additional connection between the destruction of cultural property and the cause of flight during a mission in lebanon in april 2019 : “cultural goods are part of the identity of the people who live in a certain place . if you destroy their culture , you also destroy their identity . many people are uprooted , often no longer have any prospects and as a result flee from their homeland . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break - uvmr_ev_paragraph_break do not place advertisements here . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break commercial links will be removed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break see this articles talk page , wp : el , and wp : spam for more information . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break wikipedia is not a link directory . consider submitting your link to dmoz instead . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break - uvmr_ev_paragraph_break do not place advertisements here . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break commercial links will be removed . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break see this articles talk page , wp : el , and wp : spam for more information . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break wikipedia is not a link directory . consider submitting your link to dmoz instead . uvmr_ev_paragraph_break  uvmr_ev_paragraph_break
